A genetic algorithm (GA) was used to position a robot at a target location while minimizing the largest joint displacement from the initial position. As currently implemented, GAs are suitable for offline programming of a redundant robot in point-to-point positioning tasks. The GA solution needs only the forward kinematic equations (which are easily developed) and does not require any artificial constraints on the joint angles. The joint rotation limits which are present in any feasible robot design are handled directly; so any solution determined by the GA is physically realizable. Finally, the GA works with joint angles represented as digital values (not continuous real numbers), which is more representative for computer-controlled robot systems.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ROBOT.1989.100000","startPage":"271","endPage":"276 vol.1","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings, 1989 International Conference on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel2/242/3146/00100000.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings, 1989 International Conference on Robotics and Automation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ROBOT.1989.100000","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3146","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Inverse kinematics of redundant robots using genetic algorithms","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Genetic algorithms","Robot kinematics","Jacobian matrices","Service robots","Lagrangian functions","Mechanical engineering","Testing","Motion planning","Differential equations","Nonlinear equations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["inverse problems","kinematics","optimisation","redundancy","robots"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["joint displacement minimisation","redundant robots","genetic algorithms","robust general-purpose optimization techniques","inverse kinematics problem","offline programming","point-to-point positioning tasks","forward kinematic equations","joint rotation limits"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/100000/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-19 May 1989","displayDocTitle":"Inverse kinematics of redundant robots using genetic algorithms","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1989","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"14-19 May 1989","accessionNumber":"3451293","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Inverse kinematics of redundant robots using genetic algorithms","confLoc":"Scottsdale, AZ, USA","sourcePdf":"00100000.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.036551S","chronDate":"14-19 May 1989","isNumber":"3146","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"242","citationCount":"65","articleId":"100000","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":100007,"authors":[{"name":"C.W.

The planning consists of applying potential fields around configuration-space obstacles and using these fields to select a safe path for the robot to follow. The advantage of using potential fields in path planning is that they offer a relatively fast and effective way to solve for safe paths around obstacles. In the proposed method of path planning, a trial path is chosen and then modified under the influence of the potential field until an appropriate path is found. By considering the entire path, the problem of being trapped in a local minimum is greatly reduced, allowing the method to be used for global planning. The algorithm was tried with success on many different realistic planning problems. By way of illustration, the algorithm is applied to a two-dimensional revolute manipulator, a mobile robot capable of translation only, and a mobile robot capable of both translation and rotation.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/100007/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-19 May 1989","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"3451299","publicationDate":"1989","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"14-19 May 1989","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Global path planning using artificial potential fields","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Global path planning using artificial potential fields","confLoc":"Scottsdale, AZ, USA","sourcePdf":"00100007.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.024195S","chronDate":"14-19 May 1989","isNumber":"3146","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"242","citationCount":"136","articleId":"100007","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-10"},{"_id":100008,"authors":[{"name":"S.J.

The authors present an analytical model for impact which is experimentally validated step-by-step. Extensive simulations and experiments are conducted to explain impact phenomena for the case of a force feedback control of a single-axis drive system. The experimental tests were conducted on a manipulator drive system which consists of a motor, a transmission, a link, a force sensor, and a movable environment. The results are based on an energy method and presented concisely in dimensionless form. To this end, a small number of dimensionless groups are used to characterize the impact behavior through simulations and tests. It is shown that integral force compensation with velocity feedback improves force tracking and reject impacts. It is also revealed that impact response can be tuned by selecting a favourable dimensionless ratio of force to approach velocity.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ROBOT.1989.100022","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3146","publicationTitle":"Proceedings, 1989 International Conference on Robotics and Automation","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings, 1989 International Conference on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel2/242/3146/00100022.pdf","endPage":"416 vol.1","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Impact and force control","doi":"10.1109/ROBOT.1989.100022","startPage":"410","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=100022","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-19 May 1989","displayDocTitle":"Impact and force control","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/100022/","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"3451310","publicationDate":"1989","conferenceDate":"14-19 May 1989","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Impact and force control","confLoc":"Scottsdale, AZ, USA","sourcePdf":"00100022.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.028863S","chronDate":"14-19 May 1989","isNumber":"3146","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"242","citationCount":"94","articleId":"100022","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":100033,"authors":[{"name":"Patrick A.

Since the problem is NP-hard, the goal is not to obtain the optimal schedule. Rather, an efficient near-optimal algorithm based on Lagrangian relaxation is presented. A nice feature of this approach is that it provides a lower bound on the cost, which can be used as a measure of suboptimality. On most problems tested, results are within 1% of the optima and have reasonable CPU times. Furthermore, the method provides job interaction information, which is then used to provide quick answers to 'what if' questions, to reconfigure the schedule to accommodate dynamic changes, and also to schedule jobs.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings, 1989 International Conference on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel2/242/3146/00100040.pdf","startPage":"528","endPage":"533 vol.1","publicationTitle":"Proceedings, 1989 International Conference on Robotics and Automation","doi":"10.1109/ROBOT.1989.100040","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ROBOT.1989.100040","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3146","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=100040","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Schedule generation and reconfiguration for parallel machines","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Parallel machines","Optimal scheduling","Job shop scheduling","Processor scheduling","Manufacturing systems","Computer simulation","Dynamic scheduling","Polynomials","Scheduling algorithm","Production"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["minimisation","production control","scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["schedule generation","schedule reconfiguration","tardiness minimization","NP-hard problem","suboptimality","identical parallel machines","total weighted job tardiness","Lagrangian relaxation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/100040/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-19 May 1989","displayDocTitle":"Schedule generation and reconfiguration for parallel machines","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1989","accessionNumber":"3451325","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"14-19 May 1989","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Schedule generation and reconfiguration for parallel machines","confLoc":"Scottsdale, AZ, USA","sourcePdf":"00100040.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.100858S","chronDate":"14-19 May 1989","isNumber":"3146","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"242","citationCount":"15","articleId":"100040","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":100053,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The actuator, based on coil springs, made of the shape-memory alloy Nitinol, is compact enough to be easily incorporated into the phalangeal structure of a robotic finger, thus eliminating the complex routing of the cables and tendons usually adopted for transmitting motion from conventional actuators (e.g. DC servomotors) to the joints. The performance of the SMA actuator is illustrated, and the concepts of temperature, strain, and stress limits for the control of the whole push-pull actuating system are emphasized. The methods adopted to improve the usually limited frequency response of SMA actuators are also described.

A process is presented for extracting line segments from adjacent collinear range measurements, and a fast algorithm is presented for matching these line segments to a model of the limits to free space of the robot. A side effect of matching observations to a local model is a correction to the estimated position of the robot at the time that the observation was made. A Kalman filter update equation is developed to permit the correspondence of a line segment to the model to be applied as a correction to estimated position.

If single cells of CEBOT are damaged, they can be repaired or replaced automatically. Since CEBOT is capable of adapting itself to changing environments, it is a very flexible system applicable in space, factory, and hostile environments. The authors propose an optimal structure decision method that can determine cell type, arrangement, degree of freedom, and link length. It is applicable to fixed-base and mobile-base manipulators.

As the first step they introduce a concept of contact formations to describe contacts among parts in a system, aiming at reducing the dimensionality of assembly verification. They also describe a technique for identifying contact formations in spite of errors in sensing and geometric uncertainties. It is impossible to verify termination conditions in general. The notion of design constraints is introduced, and design constraints for which verification can be guaranteed are formulated. The constraints are reasonable in the sense that they do not impose unrealistic conditions on typical designs. Results of implementation on a robot system consisting of PUMA robot with RTI force/torque sensors support the theoretical derivations and show empirically that the theoretical constraints can be relaxed somewhat and good results still be obtained.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ROBOT.1989.100082","pdfPath":"/iel2/242/3146/00100082.pdf","startPage":"800","endPage":"807 vol.2","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings, 1989 International Conference on Robotics and Automation","publicationTitle":"Proceedings, 1989 International Conference on Robotics and Automation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ROBOT.1989.100082","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3146","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Identification and verification of termination conditions in fine motion in presence of sensor errors and geometric uncertainties","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/100082/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-19 May 1989","displayDocTitle":"Identification and verification of termination conditions in fine motion in presence of sensor errors and geometric uncertainties","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"3471163","publicationDate":"1989","conferenceDate":"14-19 May 1989","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Identification and verification of termination conditions in fine motion in presence of sensor errors and geometric uncertainties","confLoc":"Scottsdale, AZ, USA","sourcePdf":"00100082.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.029951S","chronDate":"14-19 May 1989","isNumber":"3146","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"242","citationCount":"71","articleId":"100082","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":100084,"authors":[{"name":"T.E.

The skin consists of hundreds of active infrared proximity sensors that cover the whole arm.

The problem of interpreting data from the sensors is handled by the step planning algorithm, which transforms the sensor data into local tangent normals in the configuration space. Once this information is available, a global path planning algorithm can then be used to move the arm through freespace or to follow the contour of obstacles that are encountered. Details of the skin design are presented, along with the computer hardware and operating logistics and the sensor data interpretation algorithm that connects this subsystem to the global motion planning subsystem.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ROBOT.1989.100121","publicationTitle":"Proceedings, 1989 International Conference on Robotics and Automation","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings, 1989 International Conference on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel2/242/3146/00100121.pdf","startPage":"1056","endPage":"1061 vol.2","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ROBOT.1989.100121","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3146","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Development of sensitive skin for a 3D robot arm operating in an uncertain environment","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Development of sensitive skin for a 3D robot arm operating in an uncertain environment","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"3471200","publicationDate":"1989","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/100121/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-19 May 1989","conferenceDate":"14-19 May 1989","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Development of sensitive skin for a 3D robot arm operating in an uncertain environment","confLoc":"Scottsdale, AZ, USA","sourcePdf":"00100121.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054103S","chronDate":"14-19 May 1989","isNumber":"3146","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"242","citationCount":"27","articleId":"100121","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":100125,"authors":[{"name":"M.W.

Global convergence in tracking of both position and internal force trajectories of the object is proved, assuming perfect models for both manipulators. The computational algorithm is similar to the Newton-Euler inverse dynamics algorithm with complexity linear in the number of links in the manipulators. A significant feature of the control method is that both manipulators use the identical computational algorithm. Thus, the concept of master/slave relationship between the two manipulators is avoided. Two simulations are presented. The first assumes an ideal model for each manipulator. As expected, the controller is stable and provides excellent tracking ability of the manipulator. The second simulation investigates the effects of modeling errors in the mass properties of each arm. The position trajectories track very close to their desired values; however, they never completely converge.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Programmable control","Adaptive control","Motion control","Arm","Manipulator dynamics","Trajectory","Computational modeling","Weight control","Convergence","Heuristic algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive control","dynamics","force control","position control","robots"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["position control","force control","trajectories tracking","global convergence","manipulator arms","adaptive controller","coordinated motion control","inverse dynamics algorithm"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3146","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ROBOT.1989.100125","startPage":"1084","endPage":"1090 vol.2","publicationTitle":"Proceedings, 1989 International Conference on Robotics and Automation","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings, 1989 International Conference on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel2/242/3146/00100125.pdf","doi":"10.1109/ROBOT.1989.100125","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive coordinated motion control of two manipulator arms","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive coordinated motion control of two manipulator arms","accessionNumber":"3471204","publicationDate":"1989","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"14-19 May 1989","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/100125/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-19 May 1989","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive coordinated motion control of two manipulator arms","confLoc":"Scottsdale, AZ, USA","sourcePdf":"00100125.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.029988S","chronDate":"14-19 May 1989","isNumber":"3146","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"242","citationCount":"48","articleId":"100125","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":100126,"authors":[{"name":"Y.-R.

The adaptation law uses Popov hyperstability theory to estimate online the uncertain parameters of multiple robot arms and payload. The approach can be used to control the motion of an object held by the arms, the contact forces between the object and the environment, and the internal forces that do not contribute to the motion and the contact forces. Three subsystem error equations are generated, i.e. a position error subsystem, a contact force error subsystem, and an internal force error subsystem. The unknown parameters of the multiple coordinated robot arms and the object are estimated in terms of the three error subsystem equations. It is shown that the proposed adaptive control scheme improves the position and internal and contact force tracking accuracy of a class of systems with an uncertain knowledge of the dynamic model.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ROBOT.1989.100126","startPage":"1091","endPage":"1096 vol.2","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings, 1989 International Conference on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel2/242/3146/00100126.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings, 1989 International Conference on Robotics and Automation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ROBOT.1989.100126","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3146","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An adaptive approach to motion and force control of multiple coordinated robot arms","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Programmable control","Adaptive control","Force control","Robot kinematics","Manipulators","Equations","Estimation theory","Payloads","Motion control","Arm"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive control","force control","parameter estimation","position control","robots","stability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive control","position control","motion control","parameter estimation","force control","multiple coordinated robot arms","Popov hyperstability theory","position error subsystem","contact force error subsystem","internal force error subsystem","tracking accuracy"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/100126/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-19 May 1989","displayDocTitle":"An adaptive approach to motion and force control of multiple coordinated robot arms","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1989","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"14-19 May 1989","accessionNumber":"3471205","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An adaptive approach to motion and force control of multiple coordinated robot arms","confLoc":"Scottsdale, AZ, USA","sourcePdf":"00100126.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043018S","chronDate":"14-19 May 1989","isNumber":"3146","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"242","citationCount":"50","articleId":"100126","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":100137,"authors":[{"name":"R.L.

This processor, called JIFFE, was designed to run close to its peak performance even on the random scalar operations characteristic of robotics algorithms. JIFFE performs nearly 20 MFLOPS (million floating-point operations per second) on practical scalar robotics code, while maintaining high performance on poorly structured code and executing some matrix code at 40 MFLOPS. Because JIFFE was designed to be a good research tool, it can be easily programmed in C.

An active stiffness control algorithm for a six-degree-of-freedom manipulation has been implemented on the controller, and a 1 kHz sampling rate has been achieved. The design assumes no specific algorithm and robot configuration, and it is easy to increase the number of drive joints. The controller is equipped with a general-purpose vector/matrix calculation engine, servo drivers, and a 16-bit microcomputer system. The calculation engine, which accelerates hole computation for advanced control methods, is based on a 13.4 MFLOPS single-chip floating-point digital signal processor (DSP). This engine was developed to simplify DSP programming without degrading its high-performance computation capabilities. Basic vector/matrix functions and general functions for scalar value computation are mask ROMed on the DSP chip.

For most AGVs, the steering functions required to keep the position and heading of the cart continuously aligned with such paths have discontinuities at the line-arc-line transitions points, because the curvature of the path is discontinuous at these points. For applications where continuous-curvature paths are desired, two types of curves are proposed; polar polynomials in place of circular-arc segments, and Cartesian polynomials in place of arc-arc or arc-line-arc segments for lane change maneuvers. Both curves have computationally simple, closed-form expressions that provide continuous curvature and precise matching of the boundary conditions at the line-curve junctions on the paths. The use of these curves in place of circular arcs for the reference-path generator on an experimental AGV has improved its tracking accuracy during the following turns, particularly at higher speeds.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ROBOT.1989.100153","publicationTitle":"Proceedings, 1989 International Conference on Robotics and Automation","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings, 1989 International Conference on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel2/242/3146/00100153.pdf","startPage":"1260","endPage":"1264 vol.3","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3146","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ROBOT.1989.100153","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-19 May 1989","displayDocTitle":"Continuous-curvature paths for autonomous vehicles","conferenceDate":"14-19 May 1989","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1989","accessionNumber":"3471231","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/100153/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Continuous-curvature paths for autonomous vehicles","confLoc":"Scottsdale, AZ, USA","sourcePdf":"00100153.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.033009S","chronDate":"14-19 May 1989","isNumber":"3146","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"242","citationCount":"118","articleId":"100153","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2022-01-22"},{"_id":100156,"authors":[{"name":"J.L.

The authors programmed a robot to juggle a single ball in three dimensions by batting it upwards with a large paddle. The robot uses a real-time binary vision system to track the ball and measure its performance. Task-level learning consists of building a model of performance errors at the task level during practice, and using that model to refine task-level commands. A polynomial surface was fitted to the errors in the path which the ball took after each hit, and this task model is used to refine how the ball is hit.

The environment considered is a two-dimensional floor plan, consisting of line segments of arbitrary size that is extended into the third dimension. To ensure that a sonar-guided vehicle does not collide with an obstacle, it is necessary to consider an obstacle that produce the weakest echoes and determine the conditions under which these obstacles can be detected. In this environment, the smallest echo is produced by the line that defines the boundary between the two planes, or the edge; and distant edges become invisible. This physical principle then becomes the basis for the navigation strategy, indicating the necessary scanning pattern and maximum step size that guarantee that no collision will occur. The approach is illustrated with results produced by a vehicular robot equipped with a Polaroid sensor. A representative floor plan and the automatically determined path are shown; a blind alley was included to observe the behavior of the algorithm.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/100178/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-19 May 1989","publicationDate":"1989","conferenceDate":"14-19 May 1989","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"3451356","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Navigating vehicles through an unstructured environment with sonar","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Navigating vehicles through an unstructured environment with sonar","confLoc":"Scottsdale, AZ, USA","sourcePdf":"00100178.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.035523S","chronDate":"14-19 May 1989","isNumber":"3146","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"242","citationCount":"33","articleId":"100178","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":100182,"authors":[{"name":"C.G.

The model can be learned by storing experiences in the memory. To make predictions, the memory is searched for relevant experience. An initial implementation of such a memory-based modeling scheme has been made on a parallel computer, the Connection Machine. The implementation machine was used to model and control a simulated planar two-joint arm and a simulated running machine. The issues and problems that arose in the preliminary work are described. It is found that the use of parallel search in the implementation of an associative content-addressable memory allows quick searching of stored experiences, and reasonable retrieval is obtained using a simple distance metric and a simple generalized scheme. The memory is able to generalize after storing only a small number of relevant experiences. The use of search by parallel processors also avoids many of the problems of previous memory-based or tubular approaches to robot modeling (such as search speed and memory requirements).<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-19 May 1989","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/100182/","accessionNumber":"3471296","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1989","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"14-19 May 1989","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Using associative content-addressable memories to control robots","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Using associative content-addressable memories to control robots","confLoc":"Scottsdale, AZ, USA","sourcePdf":"00100182.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.035268S","chronDate":"14-19 May 1989","isNumber":"3146","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"242","citationCount":"14","articleId":"100182","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-28"},{"_id":100183,"authors":[{"name":"V.C.

The control task chosen to demonstrate the integration technique involves teaching a two-link manipulator how to make a tennis-like swing. A three-level task hierarchy is defined consisting of low-level reflexes, reflex modulators, and an execution monitor. The rule-based execution monitor first determines how to make a successful swing using rules alone. It then teaches a neural network how to accomplish the task by having it observe rule-based task execution. Following initial training, the execution monitor continuously evaluates neural network performance and re-engages swing-maneuver rules whenever changes in the manipulator or its operating environment necessitate retraining of the network. Simulation results show the interaction between rule-based and network-based system components during various phases of training and supervision.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-19 May 1989","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/100184/","accessionNumber":"3451361","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1989","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"14-19 May 1989","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Integrating neural networks and knowledge-based systems for robotic control","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Integrating neural networks and knowledge-based systems for robotic control","confLoc":"Scottsdale, AZ, USA","sourcePdf":"00100184.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046625S","chronDate":"14-19 May 1989","isNumber":"3146","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"242","citationCount":"5","articleId":"100184","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":100192,"authors":[{"name":"S.P.

It is proposed to achieve this goal using the theory of dynamic variable-structure systems. For this purpose a dynamic compensator is introduced, forming the switching function such that the dimension of the sliding mode equals that of the manipulator system. The resulting motions of the system reach and stay on the desired motion of an ideal model. In this manner, good dynamic performance of the sliding mode can be prescribed. Several reaching strategies are proposed to steer the trajectory towards the sliding manifold. The associated reaching conditions are specified such that the desired motion of the model can be reached in a finite interval of time. A variety of algorithms are recommended to govern the rate of reaching the model while satisfying the reaching conditions.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/100192/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-19 May 1989","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"3471244","publicationDate":"1989","conferenceDate":"14-19 May 1989","displayDocTitle":"Variable structure model-reaching control strategy for robot manipulators","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Variable structure model-reaching control strategy for robot manipulators","confLoc":"Scottsdale, AZ, USA","sourcePdf":"00100192.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.03206S","chronDate":"14-19 May 1989","isNumber":"3146","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"242","citationCount":"19","articleId":"100192","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2022-01-15"},{"_id":100207,"authors":[{"name":"J.J.

The control task is to make corrections to the motion of the robot that serve to maintain a fixed level of energy (and minimize energy losses), which yields a stable periodic limit cycle in the system's state space. Control of the robot is achieved by the use of artificial neural networks (ANNs) with a continuous learning memory. Through continuous reinforcement for past successes and failures, the control system develops a stable strategy for accomplishing the desired control objectives. The results are presented in the form of computer simulation that demonstrate the ability of two different ANNs to devise proper control signals that will develop a stable hopping strategy, and hence a stable limit cycle in the robot's state space, using imprecise knowledge of both the current state and the mathematical model of the robot leg.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-19 May 1989","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/100207/","accessionNumber":"3471259","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1989","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"14-19 May 1989","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A neural network learning strategy for the control of a one-legged hopping machine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A neural network learning strategy for the control of a one-legged hopping machine","confLoc":"Scottsdale, AZ, USA","sourcePdf":"00100207.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066235S","chronDate":"14-19 May 1989","isNumber":"3146","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"242","citationCount":"2","articleId":"100207","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":100210,"authors":[{"name":"N.

For applications where the angle of rotation is known in advance, the authors present a method to speed up the execution of the CORDIC algorithm by reducing the total number of iterations. This is accomplished by using a technique called angle recording, which encodes the desired rotation angle as a linear combination of very few elementary rotation angles. Each of these elementary rotation angles takes one CORDIC iteration to compute. The fewer the elementary rotation angles, the fewer the iterations required. A greedy algorithm that takes only O(n/sup 2/) operations is developed to perform CORDIC angle recording. It can reduce the total number of required elementary rotation angles by at least 50% without affecting the computational accuracy.

Therefore, the chip structure is partitioned into three stages: the first and the last one implement MDCTs, while the second stage is a shared memory array. The DCT design was achieved by means of the OLYMPUS synthesis system, an experimental suite of synthesis tools.

It is demonstrated that an ANN can be a useful tool for static security assessment of power systems.

The ANN, however, requires a great deal of time for offline training. This problem is compounded as the system size increases. Learning complexity theory can be used to better understand this scaling problem. Alterations which may lead to better performance include accelerated learning algorithms and the use of oracle-based learning.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.1989.100397","startPage":"490","endPage":"494 vol.1","displayPublicationTitle":"1989 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","pdfPath":"/iel2/815/3148/00100397.pdf","publicationTitle":"1989 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.1989.100397","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3148","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Artificial neural networks for power system static security assessment","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power system security","Artificial neural networks","Data security","Steady-state","Table lookup","Nearest neighbor searches","Power generation","Training data","System testing","Power transmission lines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["learning systems","neural nets","power system analysis computing","virtual machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["learning complexity theory","artificial neural network","static security","test system","power systems","classification","recall time","data storage requirements","offline training","scaling problem","accelerated learning algorithms","oracle-based learning"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/100397/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 May 1989","displayDocTitle":"Artificial neural networks for power system static security assessment","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1989","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"8-11 May 1989","accessionNumber":"3624081","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Artificial neural networks for power system static security assessment","confLoc":"Portland, OR, USA","sourcePdf":"00100397.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.113295S","chronDate":"8-11 May 1989","isNumber":"3148","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"815","citationCount":"31","articleId":"100397","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":100398,"authors":[{"name":"M.-Y.

When solutions are located on the boundary of the hypercube, the system is said to be in a saturated mode. The class of systems considered retains the basic structure of the Hopfield model but is easier to analyze, synthesize, and implement. An efficient analysis method is developed which can be used to completely determine the set of asymptotically stable equilibrium points and the set of unstable equilibrium points.

The signal is given by the set of its unequally spaced samples, and it suffices to find their uniformly distributed counterparts and then use the 2-D Shannon sampling theorem for signal reconstruction. A set of uniformly spaced samples is evaluated by solving a system of linear equations given by the 2-D Shannon theorem. To reduce the computational complexity caused by the large size of the system matrix and avoid the ill-conditioning that can occur if the nonuniform samples deviate too far from the synchronous points, the proposed method uses the partitioning of a given data block into very short overlapping subintervals of size 3*3. An innovative iterative procedure is applied to reduce the error caused by applying an extremely short 3*3 observation range. Repeated application of this procedure is used to update the estimated values of the uniformly spaced samples. A simulation example shows that the proposed windowing technique combined with the iterative procedure is simple, efficient, and rapidly convergent.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image reconstruction","Frequency","Jacobian matrices","Image converters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["filtering and prediction theory","two-dimensional digital filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["2D bandlimited signal signals","iterative procedure for uniform resampling","2-D signal","nonequally-spaced samples","Nyquist frequency","2-D Shannon sampling theorem","signal reconstruction","uniformly spaced samples","computational complexity","partitioning","short overlapping subintervals","windowing technique","rapidly convergent"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.1989.100541","publicationTitle":"1989 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","displayPublicationTitle":"1989 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","pdfPath":"/iel2/815/3148/00100541.pdf","startPage":"1087","endPage":"1090 vol.2","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3148","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.1989.100541","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An iterative procedure for uniform resampling of a 2-D signal from its nonequally-spaced samples","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=100541","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"An iterative procedure for uniform resampling of a 2-D signal from its nonequally-spaced samples","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/100541/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1989","accessionNumber":"3636552","conferenceDate":"8-11 May 1989","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 May 1989","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An iterative procedure for uniform resampling of a 2-D signal from its nonequally-spaced samples","confLoc":"Portland, OR, USA","sourcePdf":"00100541.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047552S","chronDate":"8-11 May 1989","isNumber":"3148","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"815","citationCount":"4","articleId":"100541","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":100544,"authors":[{"name":"J.Y.

First, the local state-space (LSS) realizations of 2-D IIR filters are reviewed. Then, two systolic array implementations, a direct form implementation, and a transformed implementation are obtained for realizing local speedup. They process one pixel during each clock time. To achieve very high speed, two global speed-up structures are used that exploit the inherent spatial concurrency. Based on the computational independence between the samples along the diagonal lines in a first-quadrant 2-D system, they work on multiple columns of images or multiple lines of images concurrently.

Previous work has resulted in the development of synthetic neural networks implemented as VLSI devices using pulse streams to represent neural states and a time-chopping technique to implement multiplication by synaptic weights. Synaptic weights are stored on-chip in digital memory. An alternative method for representing synaptic weights is described which uses dynamic storage capacitors to hold the charge proportional to synaptic weight. The capacitive storage devices are refreshed from off-chip digital RAM via a digital-to-analog converter. The presence, absence, and rate of pulse firing of the neuron are used to represent its state. Multiplication of a neuron state by a synaptic weight is performed by modifying the width of individual pulses passing through the synapse. A circuit that performs this function is described.

A new CMOS circuit is described that behaves like an MOS transistor with a threshold voltage that is easily adjusted by external control. The circuit is designed to be used in neural-type circuit applications, where threshold voltage adjustments can act to fix the connection weights which determine the amount of transmission from one neuron's output to another neuron's input. The circuit uses capacitive coupling between the input gate of the MOS transistor and a controlling input voltage through a differential amplifier-type circuit. In some cases, the capacitive coupling need only involve parasitic capacitors, so that no extra capacitor needs to be inserted. The PSPICE simulation program was used to simulate the circuit, giving the V-I characteristics of the device for different controlling voltages.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.1989.100574","startPage":"1221","endPage":"1222 vol.2","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems,","pdfPath":"/iel2/815/3148/00100574.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems,","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.1989.100574","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3148","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"CMOS circuit for MOS transistor threshold adjustment: a means for neural network weight adjustment","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MOSFETs","Neural networks","Nonvolatile memory","SPICE","CMOS process","Coupling circuits","Voltage control","MOS capacitors","Circuit simulation","Laboratories"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["circuit CAD","CMOS integrated circuits","differential amplifiers","digital simulation","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS circuit","MOS transistor threshold adjustment","neural network weight adjustment","threshold voltage","neural-type circuit applications","connection weights","capacitive coupling","input gate","differential amplifier-type circuit","parasitic capacitors","PSPICE simulation program","V-I characteristics"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/100574/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 May 1989","displayDocTitle":"CMOS circuit for MOS transistor threshold adjustment: a means for neural network weight adjustment","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1989","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"8-11 May 1989","accessionNumber":"3636581","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"CMOS circuit for MOS transistor threshold adjustment: a means for neural network weight adjustment","confLoc":"Portland, OR, USA","sourcePdf":"00100574.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052914S","chronDate":"8-11 May 1989","isNumber":"3148","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"815","articleId":"100574","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":100576,"authors":[{"name":"T.

For multicomponent signals, two-dimensional windowing in the time-frequency domain (a form of time-varying filtering) is used to isolate each component; IF estimation is then applied to the individual components. The periodic first moment of a TFD is used to estimate the IF. A suitable definition and of the periodic first moment is proposed, and the relationship of these estimators to others based on the central finite difference of the phase of the analytic signal is given.

The redundancy within adjacent video frames is exploited by motion-compensated interframe prediction, and the motion-compensated frame difference (MCFD) signal is vector quantized adaptively. The MCFD and the motion information are transmitted to the receiver to reconstruct the frames. It is noted that the dependence of the vector codebooks on the set of training signals is much less for the MCFD signals than the original video frames. The MCFD signals are classified into the five groups according to the local variances. A multicodebook vector quantizer is designed that is based on all groups. Some simple masking properties are also used in the design of the vector quantizer. An average signal-to-noise ratio of 37.85 dB is obtained for their highly active CINDY video sequence with an average bit rate of 0.47 b/pixel over 40 frames.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems,","pdfPath":"/iel2/815/3148/00100613.pdf","startPage":"1378","endPage":"1381 vol.2","publicationTitle":"IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems,","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.1989.100613","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.1989.100613","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3148","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=100613","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive vector quantization of video signals with motion compensation and spatial masking","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Vector quantization","Motion compensation","Bit rate","Video sequences","Motion detection","Motion estimation","Pixel","Encoding","Video coding","Redundancy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive systems","compensation","decoding","encoding","picture processing","video signals"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive vector quantisation","SNR","video signals","motion compensation","spatial masking","low-bit-rate","video sequence coding","redundancy","adjacent video frames","motion-compensated interframe prediction","vector codebooks","training signals","multicodebook vector quantizer","CINDY video sequence","37.85 dB"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/100613/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 May 1989","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive vector quantization of video signals with motion compensation and spatial masking","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1989","accessionNumber":"3636616","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"8-11 May 1989","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive vector quantization of video signals with motion compensation and spatial masking","confLoc":"Portland, OR, USA","sourcePdf":"00100613.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.091869S","chronDate":"8-11 May 1989","isNumber":"3148","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"815","citationCount":"1","articleId":"100613","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":100614,"authors":[{"name":"K.K.

The author shows that the ACS loop operation (although nonlinear) can exploit look-ahead. He uses techniques of look-ahead, decomposition, and incremental computation, and proposes fine-grain pipelined and parallel architectures for area-efficient high-speed VLSI implementation of DP problems. The word-level arithmetic implementation complexity of the architecture is proportional to the cube of the number of states of the DP problem, logarithmic in number of loop pipeline levels, linear in block size, and additive with respect to pipelining and block processing. The data-dependent nature of the quantization operation limits the opportunities to pipeline the quantizer loops. The author proposes an approach to transform the quantizer loop into an equivalent form that can exploit look-ahead. The transformed quantizer loop recursion is shown to be similar to the DP recursion, and variations of the DP processor architectures can be used for high-speed implementation of simple quantizer loops.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.1989.100614","publicationTitle":"IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems,","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems,","pdfPath":"/iel2/815/3148/00100614.pdf","startPage":"1382","endPage":"1387 vol.2","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.1989.100614","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3148","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Look-ahead in dynamic programming and quantizer loops","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/100614/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 May 1989","displayDocTitle":"Look-ahead in dynamic programming and quantizer loops","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1989","accessionNumber":"3624109","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"8-11 May 1989","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Look-ahead in dynamic programming and quantizer loops","confLoc":"Portland, OR, USA","sourcePdf":"00100614.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038553S","chronDate":"8-11 May 1989","isNumber":"3148","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"815","citationCount":"21","articleId":"100614","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":100632,"authors":[{"name":"M.F.

The major difficulty in the analysis is the discontinuity of network variables and the presence of impulsive voltages and currents at the switching instants. The method entails a two-step integration based on a special numerical Laplace inversion. It is applicable to any linear circuit configuration; capacitor loops, inductor cutsets, ideal switches with zero impedance or admittance, and impulsive sources do not present problems. An important application is in computing the switching transformation matrices that relate the initial conditions of the network to the circuit conditions before switching. These matrices are needed in frequency analysis of general periodically switched linear networks.

Moreover, it can be programmed in terms of number and width of layers.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.1989.100810","startPage":"2185","endPage":"2188 vol.3","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems,","pdfPath":"/iel2/815/3148/00100810.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems,","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.1989.100810","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3148","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A digital 'snake' implementation of the back-propagation neural network","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Neurons","Multi-layer neural network","Very large scale integration","Pipeline processing","Artificial neural networks","Vectors","Signal processing algorithms","Nearest neighbor searches","Data buses"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer architecture","neural nets","pipeline processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["snake implementation","back-propagation neural network","digital implementation","multilayer neural network model","backpropagation","learning algorithm","architecture","linear sequence","data exchange","neurons","data buses","full pipelining","forward mode","local connections"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/100810/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 May 1989","displayDocTitle":"A digital 'snake' implementation of the back-propagation neural network","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1989","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"8-11 May 1989","accessionNumber":"3649578","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A digital 'snake' implementation of the back-propagation neural network","confLoc":"Portland, OR, USA","sourcePdf":"00100810.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.028449S","chronDate":"8-11 May 1989","isNumber":"3148","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"815","citationCount":"2","articleId":"100810","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":100811,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Only information on the tree is stored in each subnetwork. In the associative process, the incomplete code on the cotree of each subnetwork is corrected to the complete code according to the error-correcting capacity. SANNET has structural redundancy, sparsity, cellular structure, high concurrency, variable code length, robustness, testability, reliability, logical neurons, unions of logic and storage elements, no crosstalk, high speed, and a unique solution.

Instead, they require that the nonlinear system be transformable into the so-called parametric-pure feedback form. When this form is strict, the proposed scheme guarantees global regulation and tracking properties, and substantially enlarges the class of nonlinear systems with unknown parameters for which global stabilization can be achieved.

The machine is designed to store 200 MJ kinetic energy and fire a salvo of nine rounds in three minutes at velocities between 2.5 and 4.0 km/s. Prime power required to meet this firing schedule is 1.865 kW, and will be supplied by a gas turbine engine. It is also possible to fire a burst of two shots in rapid succession, if desired. Operating speed of the machine is 8250 r/min and it has design ratings of 3.2 MA peak current and 20 GW peak power into a 9 MJ railgun load. A two-pole configuration is used for pulse-length considerations, and selectivity passive compensation is used to produced a relatively flat pulse and limit peak projectile acceleration to about 980000 m/s/sup 2/. Other distinguishing features include an air core magnetic circuit, separate rotor armature windings for self-excitation and railgun firing, ambient temperature field coils, and excitation field magnetic energy recovery capability. A detailed description of the machine as designed, and its auxiliary and control systems, is provided.

Results of the analysis show that the true performance of a reluctance launcher varies considerable from that predicted by classical closed-form flux analysis.

The work presented introduces a method, a system design, and a prototype implementation that uses genetic-based machine learning to acquire negotiation rules. The learned rules support a party involved in a two-party bargaining problem with multiple issues. It is assumed that both parties work towards a compromise deal. The method provides a framework in which genetic-based learning is applied repetitively on a changing problem representation. System design proposes a problem representation that is adequate to express bargaining processes and that is at the same time conducive to genetic-based learning. The authors report results of experiments with the prototype implementation. These results indicate that genetically learned rules, when used in real negotiations, yield results that are better than results obtained by humans in the same negotiation. The experiments indicate considerable robustness of genetically learned rules with respect to varying parameters defining the genetic operations on which the system relies in modeling negotiations. In terms of user support, experimental results show that in the bargaining process, a good rule is one that advises conceding in small steps and bringing new issues into the negotiation process.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel1/21/3155/00101141.pdf","startPage":"102","endPage":"114","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Genetic algorithms approach to a negotiation support system","doi":"10.1109/21.101141","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3155","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/21.101141","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=101141","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/101141/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan/Feb 1991","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan/Feb 1991","displayDocTitle":"Genetic algorithms approach to a negotiation support system","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Jan.-Feb. 1991","accessionNumber":"3880231","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"21","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Genetic algorithms approach to a negotiation support system","sourcePdf":"00101141.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.042317S","chronDate":"Jan/Feb 1991","isNumber":"3155","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"21","citationCount":"77","articleId":"101141","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":101143,"authors":[{"name":"J.P.

Because of the inherent time delay caused by the image processing, the motion of the moving target is predicted in real time and is used in the online planning of the trajectory for the manipulator motion. Since the dynamics of the target are assumed to be unknown, the prediction is accomplished by means of an autoregressive discrete-time model. On the basis of the predicted motion of the object, the planner determines online at each control sampling instant the desired trajectory point (subgoal) for the controller. The subgoal point is tracked by controlling the end effector with self-tuner until grasping occurs. A simulation study and laboratory experiments are presented to demonstrate the performance of this visual feedback system.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3155","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/21.101144","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel1/21/3155/00101144.pdf","startPage":"134","endPage":"142","doi":"10.1109/21.101144","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Real-time vision feedback for servoing robotic manipulator with self-tuning controller","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan/Feb 1991","displayDocTitle":"Real-time vision feedback for servoing robotic manipulator with self-tuning controller","volume":"21","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan.-Feb. 1991","accessionNumber":"3880232","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/101144/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan/Feb 1991","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Real-time vision feedback for servoing robotic manipulator with self-tuning controller","sourcePdf":"00101144.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.05848S","chronDate":"Jan/Feb 1991","isNumber":"3155","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"21","citationCount":"162","articleId":"101144","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":101153,"authors":[{"name":"Z.-B.

The E/sup -1/2/ field dependence observed suggests that the total number of interface traps created in these devices may be determined by hole trapping near the Si/SiO/sub 2/ interface for positive-bias irradiation or near the gate/SiO/sub 2/ interface for negative bias irradiation, though H/sup +/ drift remains the likely rate-limiting step in the process. Based on these results, a hole-trapping/hydrogen transport model-involving hole trapping and subsequent near-interfacial H/sup +/ release, transport, and reaction at the interface-is proposed as a possible explanation of Delta V/sub it/ buildup in these polysilicon- and metal-gate transistors.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/101171/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1990","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1990","volume":"37","issue":"6","accessionNumber":"3847603","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Dec. 1990","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Field dependence of interface-trap buildup in polysilicon and metal gate MOS devices","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Field dependence of interface-trap buildup in polysilicon and metal gate MOS devices","sourcePdf":"00101171.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043652S","chronDate":"Dec.  1990","isNumber":"3156","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"119","articleId":"101171","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":101173,"authors":[{"name":"R.E.

The shift of interface state density from the broad peak at 0.7 eV to below midgap is found to be reversible. The direction of the shift is determined by the surface potential. The postirradiation introduction of hydrogen into the gate oxide increases the interface state density across the bandgap and decreases N/sub ot/ by a similar amount. Following the introduction of hydrogen, the reversibility of N/sub ot/ is increased by an order of magnitude. These effects show the connection between the experimental conditions and the type of postirradiation behavior that is observed. Models for the hydrogen-induced D/sub it/ buildup and for the reversibility of D/sub it/ and N/sub ot/ are discussed.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel1/23/3156/00101173.pdf","startPage":"1641","endPage":"1649","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","doi":"10.1109/23.101173","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/23.101173","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3156","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=101173","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Post-irradiation behavior of the interface state density and the trapped positive charge","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interface states","Photonic band gap","Hydrogen","MOSFETs","Capacitors","Capacitance-voltage characteristics","MOS devices","Charge pumps","Laboratories","Silicon"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hole traps","insulated gate field effect transistors","interface electron states","surface potential","X-ray effects"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MOSFET","X-ray irradiation","interface state density","trapped positive charge","postirradiation behavior","energy distribution","MOS devices","surface potential","gate oxide","Si-SiO/sub 2/:H"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/101173/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1990","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1990","displayDocTitle":"Post-irradiation behavior of the interface state density and the trapped positive charge","volume":"37","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 1990","accessionNumber":"3847604","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Post-irradiation behavior of the interface state density and the trapped positive charge","sourcePdf":"00101173.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.12411S","chronDate":"Dec.  1990","isNumber":"3156","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"100","articleId":"101173","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":101177,"authors":[{"name":"P.J.

Ferroelectric capacitors were irradiated using X-ray and Co-60 sources to dose levels up to 16 Mrad(Si). The capacitors were characterized for their memory properties both before and after irradiation. The radiation hardness was process dependent. Three out of four processes resulted in capacitors that showed less than 30% radiation-induced degradation in retained polarization charge and remnant polarization after irradiating to 16 Mrad(Si). On the other hand, one of the processes showed significant radiation-induced degradation in retained polarization charge and remanent polarization at dose levels above 1 Mrad(Si). A model for simulating the observed degradation is developed. The model indicates that the data are consistent with trapping of radiation-induced charge in the ferroelectric material. The radiation hardness levels indicate that ferroelectric devices can be fabricated that can survive radiation exposures well in excess of 10 Mrad(Si).<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/23.101180","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","startPage":"1703","endPage":"1712","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel1/23/3156/00101180.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/23.101180","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3156","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Total-dose radiation-induced degradation of thin film ferroelectric capacitors","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Degradation","Transistors","Ferroelectric materials","Capacitors","Polarization","Nonvolatile memory","Laboratories","Fatigue","Annealing","Ferroelectric devices"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dielectric polarisation","ferroelectric storage","gamma-ray effects","lead compounds","radiation hardening (electronics)","thin film capacitors","X-ray effects"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["total dose radiation induced degradation","X-ray irradiation","gamma irradiation","thin film ferroelectric capacitors","radiation hardness","memory properties","retained polarization charge","remnant polarization","model","radiation-induced charge","1.6*10/sup 7/ rad","PZT","PbZrO3TiO3"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1990","displayDocTitle":"Total-dose radiation-induced degradation of thin film ferroelectric capacitors","volume":"37","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"3847612","publicationDate":"Dec. 1990","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1990","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/101180/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Total-dose radiation-induced degradation of thin film ferroelectric capacitors","sourcePdf":"00101180.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.045162S","chronDate":"Dec.  1990","isNumber":"3156","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"72","articleId":"101180","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":101181,"authors":[{"name":"J.M.

Specifically, package-induced dose enhancement in 256K CMOS static-random-access-memories (SRAMs) and dose enhancement from finite-range electrons produced (by gamma-ray interactions) in materials external to the SRAM packages are studied. Two gamma-ray simulators with significantly different spectra are used in the studies. The spectral differences produced less change in SRAM upset levels than did surrounding materials of equal mass density but differing atomic number. The implication for gamma-ray simulation testing is that individual devices within electronic systems may respond quite differently in gamma-ray TREE testing because of the structural materials within the system than when tests are performed on these individual devices without the system present.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel1/23/3156/00101188.pdf","startPage":"1756","endPage":"1761","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Simulation fidelity issues when using gamma-ray simulators for TREE testing CMOS SRAM","doi":"10.1109/23.101188","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3156","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/23.101188","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=101188","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/101188/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1990","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1990","displayDocTitle":"Simulation fidelity issues when using gamma-ray simulators for TREE testing CMOS SRAM","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Dec. 1990","accessionNumber":"3847620","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"37","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Simulation fidelity issues when using gamma-ray simulators for TREE testing CMOS SRAM","sourcePdf":"00101188.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.096472S","chronDate":"Dec.  1990","isNumber":"3156","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"1","articleId":"101188","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":101191,"authors":[{"name":"P.W.

Comparisons between predicted and measured dark current distributions in a silicon charge injection device (CID) show excellent agreement for 12- and 63-MeV proton-induced damage. The calculated and measured damage extremes are compared using extreme value statistical analysis. The calculations reveal how high-energy recoils from proton-induced nuclear reactions strongly influence the pixel-to-pixel variation in damage as well as the damage extremes.

An approach to implementing QML for single-event upset (SEU) immunity on 16k SRAMs that involves relating values of feedback resistance to system error rates is demonstrated. It is seen that the process capability indices, C/sub p/ and C/sub pk/, for the manufacture of 400-k Omega feedback resistors required to provide SEU tolerance do not conform to 6 sigma quality standards. For total-dose, interface trap charge, Delta V/sub it/, shifts measured on transistors are correlated with circuit response in the space environment. Statistical process control (SPC) is illustrated for Delta V/sub it/, and violations of SPC rules are interpreted in terms of continuous improvement. Design validation for SEU and quality conformance inspections for total-dose are identified as major obstacles to cost-effective QML implementation. Techniques and tools that will help QML provide real cost savings are identified as physical models, 3-D device-plus-circuit codes, and improved design simulators.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Implementing QML for radiation hardness assurance","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","doi":"10.1109/23.101193","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel1/23/3156/00101193.pdf","startPage":"1794","endPage":"1805","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/23.101193","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3156","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=101193","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/101193/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1990","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1990","displayDocTitle":"Implementing QML for radiation hardness assurance","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"37","issue":"6","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Dec. 1990","accessionNumber":"3847625","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Implementing QML for radiation hardness assurance","sourcePdf":"00101193.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038353S","chronDate":"Dec.  1990","isNumber":"3156","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"40","articleId":"101193","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":101194,"authors":[{"name":"D.M.

This model is combined with 12 heuristic guidelines derived from studies of oxide- and interface-trap charge ( Delta V/sub ot/ and Delta V/sub it/) buildup and annealing to develop a method to predict MOS switched-bias response from steady-state irradiations, with no free parameters. For n-channel MOS devices, predictions of Delta V/sub ot/, Delta V/sub it/, and mobility degradation differ from experimental values through irradiation by less than 30% in all cases considered. This is demonstrated for gate oxides with widely varying Delta V/sub ot/ and Delta V/sub it/ and for parasitic field oxides. Preliminary results suggest that n-channel MOS Delta V/sub ot/ annealing and Delta V/sub it/ buildup following switched-bias irradiation and through switched-bias annealing also may be predicted with less than 30% error. The p-channel MOS response at high frequencies (>1 kHz) is more difficult to predict.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel1/23/3156/00101194.pdf","startPage":"1806","endPage":"1817","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","doi":"10.1109/23.101194","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/23.101194","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3156","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=101194","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Predicting switched-bias response from steady-state irradiations MOS transistors","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Steady-state","MOSFETs","Circuit testing","Electron traps","Predictive models","Guidelines","Annealing","Laboratories","MOS devices","Switching circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["carrier mobility","hole traps","insulated gate field effect transistors","interface electron states","semiconductor device models","X-ray effects"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["oxide-trap charge buildup","MOST","X-ray irradiation","trapped holes","switched-bias response","steady-state irradiations","MOS transistors","semiempirical model","radiation-induced charge neutralization","interface-trap charge","n-channel MOS devices","mobility degradation","gate oxides","parasitic field oxides","annealing","p-channel MOS response"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/101194/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1990","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1990","displayDocTitle":"Predicting switched-bias response from steady-state irradiations MOS transistors","volume":"37","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 1990","accessionNumber":"3847626","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Predicting switched-bias response from steady-state irradiations MOS transistors","sourcePdf":"00101194.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.048512S","chronDate":"Dec.  1990","isNumber":"3156","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"60","articleId":"101194","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":101195,"authors":[{"name":"M.P.

Comparing the ion and laser upset data for two such vastly different technologies gives a good measure of how versatile the technique is. The technique provided both consistent and repeatable results that agreed with published ion upset data for both types of circuits. However, measurements of the absolute threshold linear energy transfer (LET) using infrared laser light do not agree with those of the ions, being about 50% too high for the SRAMs, and about 20% too high for the bipolar flip-flops. The consistency of the results, together with the advantages of using a laser system, suggests that the pulsed laser can be used for SEU/SEL hardness assurance of integrated circuits.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/23.101196","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel1/23/3156/00101196.pdf","startPage":"1825","endPage":"1831","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/23.101196","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3156","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Pulsed laser-induced SEU in integrated circuits: a practical method for hardness assurance testing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1990","displayDocTitle":"Pulsed laser-induced SEU in integrated circuits: a practical method for hardness assurance testing","volume":"37","issue":"6","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"3847628","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 1990","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/101196/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1990","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Pulsed laser-induced SEU in integrated circuits: a practical method for hardness assurance testing","sourcePdf":"00101196.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.031505S","chronDate":"Dec.  1990","isNumber":"3156","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"47","articleId":"101196","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":101197,"authors":[{"name":"T.L.

An analysis technique for complex SEP response has been developed that allows system analysis for the data in order to increase confidence in their thoroughness. The resulting data are directly applicable to existing orbital error rate codes. The general analysis technique is the main thrust of this study. For a circuit with a complex SEP response, guidelines are established which allow a complete solution to the linear system by establishing relevant error categories, the raw error variables, and a method of error separation. When the data are presented in the framework of a complete linear system, the required independent analysis for system use can proceed with high confidence in the SEP data.

Rollins (1987), is confirmed. Shorter channel lengths and higher power supply voltages caused the ratio, M, of upset charge to deposited charge to increase. As a result of this multiplication factor, actual devices are more likely to upset than expected from an analysis of only the collected charge. A mixed-mode simulator was used to model the charge collection process. The results showed that the M factor is a very fluid number which is dependent on minority carrier lifetime, drain voltage, and the switching dynamics of the cell in addition to the dependence on mobility ratio and channel length reported by Rollins. Parasitic bipolar gain at high injection levels appears to be the primary mechanism allowing collected charge to be greater than deposited charge. The simulator and experimental data show that, as floating body static memory transistors are down scaled, the particle energy needed to upset the cell is reduced because of the enhanced parasitic bipolar gain effect as well as a reduction in the node capacitance.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/23.101201","startPage":"1855","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel1/23/3156/00101201.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/23.101201","endPage":"1860","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3156","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Experimental and simulation study of the effects of cosmic particles on CMOS/SOS RAMs","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/101201/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1990","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1990","displayDocTitle":"Experimental and simulation study of the effects of cosmic particles on CMOS/SOS RAMs","volume":"37","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"3857708","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Dec. 1990","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Experimental and simulation study of the effects of cosmic particles on CMOS/SOS RAMs","sourcePdf":"00101201.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.028023S","chronDate":"Dec.  1990","isNumber":"3156","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"8","articleId":"101201","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":101205,"authors":[{"name":"A.H.

The TFD provides energy information for each transiting fragment. Data analysis provides the energy of the individual ion responsible for each SEU; thus, separate upset cross sections can be developed for different energy and mass regions of the californium spectrum. This californium-based device is quite small and fits onto a bench top. It provides a convenient and inexpensive supplement or alternative to accelerator and high-altitude/space SEU testing.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/23.101209","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel1/23/3156/00101209.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3156","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/23.101209","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","startPage":"1916","endPage":"1922","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new method for using /sup 252/Cf in SEU testing (SRAM)","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=101209","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1990","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1990","displayDocTitle":"A new method for using /sup 252/Cf in SEU testing (SRAM)","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/101209/","volume":"37","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 1990","accessionNumber":"3847640","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new method for using /sup 252/Cf in SEU testing (SRAM)","sourcePdf":"00101209.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036598S","chronDate":"Dec.  1990","isNumber":"3156","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"10","articleId":"101209","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":101212,"authors":[{"name":"R.

The data are separated and analyzed, deriving upset rates for the various memory devices under quiet cosmic-ray, South Atlantic anomaly, and solar flare conditions.

An improved CDS method (CDS2) is presented that completely eliminates the pixel crosstalk and kTC-noise contribution, but maintains a low noise bandwidth. The noise reduction achieved with the method lies in the range of 3-8 dB, with the lower limit valid for white noise and the upper limit for pixel crosstalk and kTC noise. The improved CDS circuit approaches optimum filtering of the combined noise spectrum. From the hardware point of view only one additional switch is required.

The approach is applicable to discrete signal spaces of any dimension, to multirate systems based on arbitrary downsampling and upsampling lattices, and for filter banks with any number of channels. A new numerical design procedure is also presented for multidimensional multirate perfect reconstruction filter banks, which is based on methods of nonlinearly constrained numerical optimization. An error function that depends only on the analysis filter impulse response coefficients is minimized, subject to a set of quadratic equality constraints that involve both the analysis and synthesis filter coefficients. With this design framework, it is possible to design a wide variety of filter banks that have a number of desirable properties. The analysis and synthesis filters that result are finite impulse response (FIR) and of equal size. In addition, both paraunitary and nonparaunitary filter banks can be designed with this method. Unlike paraunitary filter banks, nonparaunitary filter banks are capable of performing analysis bank functions more general than band-splitting with flat passband filters.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/31.101301","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel1/31/3158/00101301.pdf","startPage":"29","endPage":"41","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/31.101301","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3158","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The analysis and design of multidimensional FIR perfect reconstruction filter banks for arbitrary sampling lattices","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=101301","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1991","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/101301/","displayDocTitle":"The analysis and design of multidimensional FIR perfect reconstruction filter banks for arbitrary sampling lattices","volume":"38","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 1991","accessionNumber":"3891705","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The analysis and design of multidimensional FIR perfect reconstruction filter banks for arbitrary sampling lattices","sourcePdf":"00101301.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041491S","chronDate":"Jan 1991","isNumber":"3158","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"31","citationCount":"184","articleId":"101301","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-28"},{"_id":101302,"authors":[{"name":"T.P.

Hence the total number of multiplications for the proposed algorithm is only half of that required for the row-column approach and is also less than that of most of other fast algorithms, whereas the number of additions is almost comparable to that of others.

Thus the number of actual multipliers being used is only a quarter of that required for the conventional approach.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/31.101322","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel1/31/3159/00101322.pdf","startPage":"297","endPage":"305","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/31.101322","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3159","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=101322","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fast algorithm and implementation of 2-D discrete cosine transform","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1991","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/101322/","displayDocTitle":"Fast algorithm and implementation of 2-D discrete cosine transform","volume":"38","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 1991","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"3901998","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast algorithm and implementation of 2-D discrete cosine transform","sourcePdf":"00101322.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.02836S","chronDate":"Mar 1991","isNumber":"3159","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"31","citationCount":"167","articleId":"101322","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":101323,"authors":[{"name":"A.

Two algorithms are presented: a sequential algorithm that generates the code bits serially one bit per machine cycle, and a parallel algorithm that generates the entire code bits of a symbol in one machine cycle. The algorithms use the principle of propagation of a token in a reverse binary tree constructed from the original codes. The design approaches are applicable to any binary codes, although the static Huffman code is used as an illustration. A hardware algorithm for generating adaptive Huffman codes is proposed, and a VLSI architecture for implementing the algorithm is described. The high speed of the algorithms ensures that data transformation is done on the fly, as data are being transferred from/to high-speed I/O communication devices.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/101323/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1991","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1991","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","publicationDate":"March 1991","accessionNumber":"3901999","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","volume":"38","issue":"3","displayDocTitle":"Efficient VLSI designs for data transformation of tree-based codes","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient VLSI designs for data transformation of tree-based codes","sourcePdf":"00101323.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.03432S","chronDate":"Mar 1991","isNumber":"3159","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"31","citationCount":"65","articleId":"101323","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":101325,"authors":[{"name":"J.E.

The accuracy of the approach, as measured by calculating the cross-section residuals of known targets in each calibrated scene, is on the order of +or-1-2 dB at the P- and C-band, but improves to +or-0.5 dB at the L-band.

The Doppler frequency estimated from azimuth spectra, however, suffers from the fact that the data are sampled with the pulse repetition frequency (PRF) and an ambiguity about the correct PRF band remains. A novel algorithm to resolve this ambiguity is proposed. It uses the fact that the Doppler centroid depends linearly on the transmitted radar frequency for a given antenna squint angle. This dependence is not subject to PRF ambiguities. It can be measured by Fourier-transforming the SAR data in the range direction and estimating the Doppler centroid at each range frequency. The achievable accuracy is derived theoretically and verified with Seasat data of different scene content. The algorithm works best with low contrast scenes, where the conventional look correlation technique fails. It needs no iterative processing of the SAR data and causes only low computational load.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Frequency estimation","Radar antennas","Layout","Synthetic aperture radar","Azimuth","Doppler radar","Antenna measurements","Frequency measurement","Iterative algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computerised picture processing","Doppler effect","geophysics computing","radar theory","remote sensing by radar"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["remote sensing","wavelength diversity","high-precision synthetic aperture radar","Doppler centroid","Doppler frequency","pulse repetition frequency","algorithm","transmitted radar frequency","accuracy","Seasat data","low contrast scenes"]}],"doi":"10.1109/36.101376","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel5/36/3161/00101376.pdf","startPage":"997","endPage":"1003","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3161","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/36.101376","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"PRF-ambiguity resolving by wavelength diversity","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=101376","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"PRF-ambiguity resolving by wavelength diversity","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/101376/","volume":"29","issue":"6","publicationDate":"Nov. 1991","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4063309","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1991","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1991","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"PRF-ambiguity resolving by wavelength diversity","sourcePdf":"00101376.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.031472S","chronDate":"Nov 1991","isNumber":"3161","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"82","articleId":"101376","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":101398,"authors":[{"name":"D.R.

In addition to average performance measures, the output process and the packet delay time distributions are evaluated.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/INFCOM.1989.101448","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFCOM.1989.101448","startPage":"152","endPage":"162 vol.1","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE INFOCOM '89, Proceedings of the Eighth Annual Joint Conference of the IEEE Computer and Communications Societies","pdfPath":"/iel2/238/3164/00101448.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE INFOCOM '89, Proceedings of the Eighth Annual Joint Conference of the IEEE Computer and Communications Societies","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3164","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"CSMa/CD with two persistence factors: a unified performance model for CSMA/CD","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-27 Apr 1989","displayDocTitle":"CSMa/CD with two persistence factors: a unified performance model for CSMA/CD","conferenceDate":"23-27 April 1989","publicationDate":"1989","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"3462584","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/101448/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"CSMa/CD with two persistence factors: a unified performance model for CSMA/CD","confLoc":"Ottawa, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"00101448.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042551S","chronDate":"23-27 Apr 1989","isNumber":"3164","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"238","articleId":"101448","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":101453,"authors":[{"name":"Y.-S.

The inherent broadcast nature of the radio channel enables a node's transmission to be received by all other nodes within range.

It is first shown that the construction of a broadcasting schedule of minimum length is NP-complete, and then a centralized algorithm based on a sequential graph-coloring heuristic is presented to construct minimal-length schedules. A distributed implementation of this algorithm is then proposed, which is based on circulating a token through the nodes in the network.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/INFCOM.1989.101493","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3164","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFCOM.1989.101493","endPage":"504 vol.2","publicationTitle":"IEEE INFOCOM '89, Proceedings of the Eighth Annual Joint Conference of the IEEE Computer and Communications Societies","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE INFOCOM '89, Proceedings of the Eighth Annual Joint Conference of the IEEE Computer and Communications Societies","pdfPath":"/iel2/238/3164/00101493.pdf","startPage":"497","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed scheduling of broadcasts in a radio network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-27 April 1989","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/101493/","displayDocTitle":"Distributed scheduling of broadcasts in a radio network","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"23-27 April 1989","accessionNumber":"3462615","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1989","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed scheduling of broadcasts in a radio network","confLoc":"Ottawa, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"101493.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056322S","chronDate":"23-27 April 1989","isNumber":"3164","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"238","citationCount":"98","articleId":"101493","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":101502,"authors":[{"name":"J.M.

Fixed-size packets are transmitted between nodes in these networks. The nodes are synchronized so that all of the packets that are received by a node within a slot transmission time arrive at a switching point simultaneously. Instead of storing large numbers of packets at intermediate nodes, a deflection strategy similar to hot-potato routing is used. There are characteristics of the MS-Net that make it well suited for deflection routing. With no buffer, 55-70% of the throughput with an infinite number of buffers has been obtained; with a single buffer per node, the throughput increases to 80-90%. With uniform load the throughput does not decrease significantly as the network utilization increases. Therefore, additional flow control mechanisms are not required to achieve the highest network throughput. The SX-Net does not have the above characteristics of the MS-Net. However, deflection routing still provides a significant portion of the available throughput. In the SX-Net, more buffers are required than in the MS-Net, and a flow control mechanism must be used to achieve the greatest throughput.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/INFCOM.1989.101529","publicationTitle":"IEEE INFOCOM '89, Proceedings of the Eighth Annual Joint Conference of the IEEE Computer and Communications Societies","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE INFOCOM '89, Proceedings of the Eighth Annual Joint Conference of the IEEE Computer and Communications Societies","pdfPath":"/iel2/238/3164/00101529.pdf","startPage":"800","endPage":"809 vol.3","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFCOM.1989.101529","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3164","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Comparison of deflection and store-and-forward techniques in the Manhattan Street and Shuffle-Exchange Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=101529","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-27 Apr 1989","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/101529/","displayDocTitle":"Comparison of deflection and store-and-forward techniques in the Manhattan Street and Shuffle-Exchange Networks","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1989","accessionNumber":"3470908","conferenceDate":"23-27 April 1989","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparison of deflection and store-and-forward techniques in the Manhattan Street and Shuffle-Exchange Networks","confLoc":"Ottawa, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"00101529.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.03605S","chronDate":"23-27 Apr 1989","isNumber":"3164","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"238","citationCount":"105","articleId":"101529","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":101539,"authors":[{"name":"I.

To solve the equation, they use a numerical technique in which the complementary cumulative function for U/sub p/ is closely approximated by a weighted sum of Laguerre functions with unknown coefficients. The functional equation is transformed into a set of linear equations from which the coefficients can be computed. Using the work-decomposition and PASTA (Poisson Arrivals Sec Time Averages) properties, the average customer waiting time can be readily obtained. Several numerical examples are included to demonstrate the validity of the technique.

Routing is accomplished by choosing among potential next nodes in a distribution fashion, based on the simple metric of queue length. De facto preference is given to congested nodes by the channel access protocol, based on queue length ratios, in order to increase their (outbound) throughput without increasing the number of channel collisions. These algorithms have the effect of spreading network traffic more evenly across the network, thereby alleviating the congestion at bottleneck nodes, so that network throughput approaches that analytically predicted using a homogeneity assumption.

Further, a 2-D DCT processor architecture has been proposed with the input buffer of an (M*1) 1-D N-point DCT processor array required for computation of the M frames of N-point input data and the output buffer of a (1*N) 1-D M-point DCT processor array required for permutation of the N frames of M-point output data, so that the total number of DCT PUs require is (M(log/sub 2/N+1)+N(log/sub 2/M+1)) with a time complexity of O(M+N).

A variation of the (M-L) algorithm called the M, L, delta algorithm is used for suboptimal searching. This algorithm requires a priori knowledge of the source statistics. It is assumed that the line drawing to be encoded is a smooth curve, with curvatures at a set of sample points along the curve forming a first-order autoregressive source. This algorithm, when used on curves of different variances, was found to work well, yielding low reconstruction distortion. Surprisingly, the algorithm was found to work well for arbitrary curves. This algorithm achieves significant reduction in bit rate without significant increase in distortion. For a given bit rate the proposed algorithm compared favorably with existing methods.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/MWSCAS.1989.101859","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3167","startPage":"333","endPage":"336 vol.1","pdfPath":"/iel2/853/3167/00101859.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 32nd Midwest Symposium on Circuits and Systems,","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 32nd Midwest Symposium on Circuits and Systems,","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWSCAS.1989.101859","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Subpixel reconstruction of line drawings: a tree searching approach","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decision trees","Engineering drawings","Image reconstruction","Decoding","Nonlinear distortion","Bit rate","Filtering","Statistics","Graphics","Reconstruction algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decoding","encoding","picture processing","trees (mathematics)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DPCM coder","M/L/delta algorithm","line drawings encoding","bit rate-reduction","subpixel reconstruction","line drawings","tree searching","chain codes","(M-L) algorithm","suboptimal searching","first-order autoregressive source"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 Aug 1989","displayDocTitle":"Subpixel reconstruction of line drawings: a tree searching approach","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/101859/","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"3820899","publicationDate":"1989","conferenceDate":"14-16 Aug. 1989","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Subpixel reconstruction of line drawings: a tree searching approach","confLoc":"Champaign, IL, USA","sourcePdf":"00101859.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060352S","chronDate":"14-16 Aug 1989","isNumber":"3167","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"853","articleId":"101859","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":101863,"authors":[{"name":"Y.H.

For applications where the angle of rotation is known in advance, it is possible to reduce the number of iterations through a technique (called angle recoding) in which the desired angle of rotation is encoded as a linear combination of very few elementary rotation angles. Unfortunately, an optimal encoding requires exhaustive search of exponentially growing number of possible combinations of these elementary angles. A Greedy algorithm which takes only O(n/sup 2/) operations was developed. It is proved that this algorithm is able to reduce the total number of elementary rotation angles by at least 50%. In the linear rotation case, it is shown that this proposed angle recoding scheme is equivalent to that of the modified Booth's recoding method. Potential applications of the angle recoding scheme to a number of rotation based digital signal processing algorithms are discussed.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 32nd Midwest Symposium on Circuits and Systems,","startPage":"349","endPage":"352 vol.1","doi":"10.1109/MWSCAS.1989.101863","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWSCAS.1989.101863","pdfPath":"/iel2/853/3167/00101863.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 32nd Midwest Symposium on Circuits and Systems,","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3167","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An angle recoding scheme for efficient realization of rotation-based digital signal processing algorithms","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/101863/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 Aug 1989","conferenceDate":"14-16 Aug. 1989","displayDocTitle":"An angle recoding scheme for efficient realization of rotation-based digital signal processing algorithms","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1989","accessionNumber":"3820902","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An angle recoding scheme for efficient realization of rotation-based digital signal processing algorithms","confLoc":"Champaign, IL, USA","sourcePdf":"00101863.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062384S","chronDate":"14-16 Aug 1989","isNumber":"3167","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"853","articleId":"101863","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":101869,"authors":[{"name":"C.

On-chip training or calibration is likely to be necessary, but can be done in an offline mode, and thus may not hinder circuit speed significantly.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/MWSCAS.1989.101900","startPage":"497","endPage":"500 vol.1","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 32nd Midwest Symposium on Circuits and Systems,","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWSCAS.1989.101900","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3167","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 32nd Midwest Symposium on Circuits and Systems,","pdfPath":"/iel2/853/3167/00101900.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A neural network approach to high performance analog circuit design","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/101900/","displayDocTitle":"A neural network approach to high performance analog circuit design","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"3843500","publicationDate":"1989","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"14-16 Aug. 1989","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 Aug 1989","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A neural network approach to high performance analog circuit design","confLoc":"Champaign, IL, USA","sourcePdf":"00101900.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.029278S","chronDate":"14-16 Aug 1989","isNumber":"3167","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"853","citationCount":"2","articleId":"101900","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":101961,"authors":[{"name":"D.

It is based on the number-theoretic method of Mobius inversion. Its computations proceed in parallel, and, except for a small number of scalings in one stage of the conjunction, only multiplications by 0, -1, and +1 are required. The implementation of an AFT channel by switched-capacitor (SC) techniques is presented. The circuit consists of one op amp, two capacitors (one for the sample and hold (S/H) stage, and one for the data accumulation), and a couple of CMOS transmission gates which serve as switches. If necessary, the accumulated data, corresponding to the intermediate sums in the AFT algorithm, can be converted to digital signals for further processing. This analog sampled data solution eliminates the requirement for a fast A/D conversion at the input.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 32nd Midwest Symposium on Circuits and Systems,","pdfPath":"/iel2/853/3167/00101976.pdf","startPage":"800","endPage":"803 vol.2","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 32nd Midwest Symposium on Circuits and Systems,","doi":"10.1109/MWSCAS.1989.101976","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWSCAS.1989.101976","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3167","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=101976","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"VLSI implementation of the arithmetic Fourier transform","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Very large scale integration","Arithmetic","Fourier transforms","Algorithm design and analysis","Concurrent computing","Operational amplifiers","Switched capacitor circuits","Coupling circuits","Switching circuits","Switches"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS integrated circuits","digital arithmetic","fast Fourier transforms","switched capacitor networks","VLSI"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["SC networks","arithmetic Fourier transform","high-speed Fourier analysis","number-theoretic method","Mobius inversion","data accumulation","CMOS transmission gates","intermediate sums","digital signals"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/101976/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 Aug 1989","displayDocTitle":"VLSI implementation of the arithmetic Fourier transform","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1989","accessionNumber":"3833427","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"14-16 Aug. 1989","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"VLSI implementation of the arithmetic Fourier transform","confLoc":"Champaign, IL, USA","sourcePdf":"00101976.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.035387S","chronDate":"14-16 Aug 1989","isNumber":"3167","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"853","citationCount":"1","articleId":"101976","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":101977,"authors":[{"name":"A.C.

Video speed, low power, and 10-b accuracy sample-and-hold operation have been achieved using a complementary connected buffer format sample switch. A high-speed p-n-p transistor used in the sample switch is formed by a combination of n-p-n and PMOS transistors. The sample-and-hold operation is accomplished by feeding back the hold capacitor voltage to the sample switch inputs, so that the inputs transfer symmetrically for the hold capacitor voltage at any input level. The sample-and-hold IC has been implemented in 1.2- mu m BiCMOS technology and evaluated. The following results have been obtained: 185-MHz 3-dB bandwidth at 22-pF hold capacitor, 63-dB signal-to-noise ratio at 8-MHz full-scale input, 20-ns acquisition time at 1-V step input, 15-ns switch setting time, and 0.1% linearity error.

A non-fixed-topology approach is realized by combining the optimization program OPTIMAN with the symbolic simulator ISAAC. After selecting a circuit topology, the user invokes ISAAC to model the circuit. ISAAC generates both exact and simplified analytic expressions, describing the circuit's behavior. The model is then passed to the design optimization program OPTIMAN. This program is based on a generalized formulation of the analog design problem. For the selected topology, the independent design variables are automatically extracted and OPTIMAN sizes all elements to satisfy the performance constraints, thereby optimizing a user-defined design objective. The global optimization method used on the analytic circuit models is simulated annealing. Practical examples show that OPTIMAN quickly designs analog circuits, closely meeting the specifications, and that it is a flexible and reliable design and exploration tool.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/4.102664","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel1/4/3172/00102664.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/4.102664","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3172","startPage":"707","endPage":"713","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analog circuit design optimization based on symbolic simulation and simulated annealing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=102664","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Analog circuit design optimization based on symbolic simulation and simulated annealing","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1990","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/102664/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1990","isJournal":true,"volume":"25","issue":"3","publicationDate":"June 1990","accessionNumber":"3724013","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analog circuit design optimization based on symbolic simulation and simulated annealing","sourcePdf":"00102664.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.0375S","chronDate":"Jun 1990","isNumber":"3172","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"167","articleId":"102664","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":102670,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The features of this new algorithm allowed high performance (8 kb/s for 1024-b words) to be obtained for relatively small area and power consumption (80 mm/sup 2/ in a 2- mu m CMOS process and 500 mW at 25 MHz).<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/4.102670","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/4.102670","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel1/4/3172/00102670.pdf","startPage":"748","endPage":"756","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3172","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new carry-free division algorithm and its application to a single-chip 1024-b RSA processor","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/102670/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1990","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1990","displayDocTitle":"A new carry-free division algorithm and its application to a single-chip 1024-b RSA processor","volume":"25","issue":"3","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 1990","accessionNumber":"3724018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new carry-free division algorithm and its application to a single-chip 1024-b RSA processor","sourcePdf":"00102670.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.027985S","chronDate":"Jun 1990","isNumber":"3172","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"72","articleId":"102670","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":102673,"authors":[{"name":"J.

The memory cell signal charge has decreased gradually with an increase in memory cell size, despite the vertically structured cell designs. To offset this decrease, multidivided data-line structures, low-power design, and transposition of folded data lines are essential. To reduce power dissipation, an increase in the maximum refresh cycle and multidivided data lines combined with shared I/O in addition to a reduced operating voltage are efficient. A BiCMOS circuit provides a high-speed access time with low cost due to the high drivability of the driver and high sensitivity of the amplifier. It is predicted that the current DRAM technology might be diversified in the future so that a large-memory-capacity-oriented technology would coexist with a high-speed-oriented technology, posing power-supply standardization as a continuing serious concern.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/4.102676","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/4.102676","startPage":"778","endPage":"789","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel1/4/3172/00102676.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3172","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Trends in megabit DRAM circuit design","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/102676/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1990","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1990","displayDocTitle":"Trends in megabit DRAM circuit design","volume":"25","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"3724020","publicationDate":"June 1990","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Trends in megabit DRAM circuit design","sourcePdf":"00102676.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.067692S","chronDate":"Jun 1990","isNumber":"3172","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"60","articleId":"102676","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":102681,"authors":[{"name":"L.-J.

A procedure for the topology development of filters in which transistors are used as URC elements is presented together with a technique which uses transistors as capacitors, along with first-order correction for the nonidealities of such 'capacitors' and of the active elements.

Fundamental tradeoffs between the minimum S/N required, number of ghosts, and the number of operations (NOPs) that the cascaded detector must perform are identified.

When this interference occurs mainly in the sidelobes of the antenna pattern, a solution to this problem is realized through a sidelobe canceler (SLC) implementation. Since the false-alarm probability is a system parameter of special importance in radar, an interference-canceling technique for radar application should maintain the false-alarm probability constant over a wide range of incident interference power. With the requirements of sidelobe interference cancellation and constant false alarm rate (CFAR), a new algorithm for radar detection in the presence of sidelobe interference is developed from the generalized likelihood ratio test of Neyman-Pearson. In this development, the received interference is modeled as a nonstationary but slowly varying Gaussian random process. Cancellation of the sidelobe interference is based upon a 'synchronous' estimate of the spatial covariance of the interference for the range gate being tested. This algorithm provides a fixed false-alarm rate and a fixed threshold which depend only upon the parameters of the algorithm.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/7.102714","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3173","startPage":"792","endPage":"803","pdfPath":"/iel4/7/3173/00102714.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/7.102714","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new CFAR sidelobe canceler algorithm for radar","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radar antennas","Interference cancellation","Signal detection","Radar detection","Adaptive arrays","Bandwidth","Antenna arrays","Object detection","Testing","Signal to noise ratio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna radiation patterns","probability","radar interference","random processes","signal detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["synchronous estimate","CFAR sidelobe canceler","radar","target detection","antenna pattern","false-alarm probability","interference-canceling","sidelobe interference cancellation","constant false alarm rate","sidelobe interference","generalized likelihood ratio test","Neyman-Pearson","slowly varying Gaussian random process","spatial covariance","fixed false-alarm rate","fixed threshold"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1990","displayDocTitle":"A new CFAR sidelobe canceler algorithm for radar","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/102714/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1990","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","volume":"26","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"3825403","publicationDate":"Sept. 1990","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new CFAR sidelobe canceler algorithm for radar","sourcePdf":"00102714.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.030229S","chronDate":"Sep 1990","isNumber":"3173","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7","citationCount":"8","articleId":"102714","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":102716,"authors":[{"name":"P.M.

The accuracy of the far-field reconstruction results are related both to the distance between such surfaces and to some a priori information concerning the near-field phase and/or the radiating system. The information on the radiating system allows relaxation of the need for any information on the near-field phase provided that the distance between the measurement surfaces is high enough. Conversely, the knowledge of a more or less corrupted near-field phase allows reduction of such distances without affecting the accuracy of the far-field reconstruction.

The dielectric is first approximated by an array of interlocking thin-wall sections; the electric field boundary conditions are then applied through the use of appropriate surface impedances. Rooftop basis functions, chosen to represent the surface current, are appropriately placed on the thin-wall sections in such a way as to accurately represent the polarization current while preventing fictitious charge within the dielectric. Rooftop currents are also used to represent the current on any conductor that may be present. The matrix elements are calculated, depending upon the distance between the source and field locations, through a scheme that employs Taylor series expansions and point source approximations. The technique is applied to scattering from dielectric cubes and composite dielectric-conductor structures, and to radiation from microstrip structures.

The technique combines the finite-element and boundary integral methods to formulate a system for the solution of the fields at the aperture and those inside the cavity via the biconjugate gradient method in conjunction with the fast Fourier transform (FFT). By virtue of the finite-element method, the proposed technique is applicable to patch antennas and arrays residing on or embedded in a layered dielectric substrate and is also capable of treating various feed configurations and impedance loads. Several numerical results are presented, demonstrating the validity, efficiency, and capability of the technique.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel4/8/3175/00102775.pdf","startPage":"1598","endPage":"1604","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/8.102775","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/8.102775","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3175","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=102775","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A hybrid finite element method for scattering and radiation by microstrip path antennas and arrays residing in a cavity","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Finite element methods","Scattering","Microstrip antenna arrays","Patch antennas","Microstrip antennas","Integral equations","Apertures","Gradient methods","Fast Fourier transforms","Antenna arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna theory","conjugate gradient methods","electromagnetic wave scattering","fast Fourier transforms","finite element analysis","microstrip antennas","microwave antenna arrays","radar cross-sections"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["microstrip antenna arrays","RCS","electromagnetic scattering","radar cross section","hybrid finite element method","microstrip path antennas","cavity","numerical technique","radiation properties","boundary integral methods","biconjugate gradient method","fast Fourier transform","FFT","layered dielectric substrate"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/102775/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1991","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1991","displayDocTitle":"A hybrid finite element method for scattering and radiation by microstrip path antennas and arrays residing in a cavity","volume":"39","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 1991","accessionNumber":"4103583","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A hybrid finite element method for scattering and radiation by microstrip path antennas and arrays residing in a cavity","sourcePdf":"00102775.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.028989S","chronDate":"Nov 1991","isNumber":"3175","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"92","articleId":"102775","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":102776,"authors":[{"name":"S.D.

Using the concept of the field equivalent (spatial) bandwidth, a central interpolation scheme is developed to compute the field in theta , phi coordinates, starting from its samples. The maximum allowable sample spacing and error upper bounds are also rigorously derived. Several simulated examples of pattern reconstruction are presented, for both the cases of field and power pattern interpolation. The interpolation error, as a function of the retained sample number, has been also evaluated and compared with the theoretical upper bounds. The algorithm stability versus randomly distributed errors added to the exact samples is demonstrated.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel4/8/3175/00102779.pdf","startPage":"1633","endPage":"1643","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/8.102779","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/8.102779","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3175","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=102779","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal interpolation of radiated fields over a sphere","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interpolation","Sampling methods","Upper bound","Signal processing algorithms","Electromagnetic scattering","X-ray scattering","Image reconstruction","Signal sampling","Electromagnetic fields","Computational modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna theory","electromagnetic wave scattering","interpolation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["scattered fields","electromagnetic scattering","field equivalent bandwidth","radiated fields","sphere","optimal sampling interpolation algorithm","maximum allowable sample spacing","error upper bounds","pattern reconstruction","algorithm stability","randomly distributed errors"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/102779/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1991","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1991","displayDocTitle":"Optimal interpolation of radiated fields over a sphere","volume":"39","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 1991","accessionNumber":"4103587","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal interpolation of radiated fields over a sphere","sourcePdf":"00102779.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033095S","chronDate":"Nov 1991","isNumber":"3175","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"115","articleId":"102779","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":102781,"authors":[{"name":"H.M.

Phase shifters are used solely to steer the main beam in the direction of the desired signal.

Platinum electrodes ranging in size from 0.002 to 0.5 cm/sup 2/ were implanted over the parietal cortex of adult cats. Ten days after implantation, the electrodes were pulsed continuously for 7 h using charge-balanced, current-regulated, symmetric pulse pairs 400 mu s per phase in duration and at a repetition rate of 50 Hz. The results show that charge density (as measured at the surface of the stimulating electrode) and charge per phase interact in a synergistic manner to determine the threshold of stimulation-induced neural injury. This interaction occurs over a wide range of both parameters: for charge density from at least 10 to 800 mu C/cm/sup 2/, and for charge per phase from at least 0.05 to 5.0 mu C per phase.

Scheduling techniques valid for strategies (2), (3), and (4) are proposed. The focus is on dataflow graphs representing data-dependent iteration. A known probability mass function for the number of cycles in the data-dependent iteration is assumed, and how a compile-time decision about assignment and/or ordering as well as timing can be made is shown. The criterion used is to minimize the expected total idle time caused by the iteration. In certain cases, this will also minimize the expected makespan of the schedule. How to determine the number of processors that should be assigned to the data-dependent iteration is shown. The method is illustrated with a practical programming example.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/12.102826","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","startPage":"1225","endPage":"1238","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel1/12/3178/00102826.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/12.102826","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3178","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Compile-time scheduling and assignment of data-flow program graphs with data-dependent iteration","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Processor scheduling","Runtime","Dynamic scheduling","Costs","Fires","Circuits","Program processors","Load management","Timing","Automatic programming"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["parallel programming","program compilers","program processors","scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compile time scheduling","assignment","data-flow program graphs","data-dependent iteration","parallel processors","fully dynamic","static-assignment","self-timed","fully static","probability mass function","idle time","programming"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1991","displayDocTitle":"Compile-time scheduling and assignment of data-flow program graphs with data-dependent iteration","volume":"40","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4098946","publicationDate":"Nov. 1991","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/102826/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Compile-time scheduling and assignment of data-flow program graphs with data-dependent iteration","sourcePdf":"00102826.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.046876S","chronDate":"Nov 1991","isNumber":"3178","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"37","articleId":"102826","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":102831,"authors":[{"name":"D.K.

The results not only show excellent writeability at modest write currents but also the existence of a narrow region of optimum write current, limited by the onset of self-erasure by the write head at high write currents. This leads to significant degradations of overwrite, signal amplitude, trackwidth, linear resolution and disk-noise-induced peak-jitters. A peak-jitter approach is shown to be useful in characterizing many aspects of recording performance. A peak-jitter evaluation of signal-to-noise behavior reveals not only satisfactory overall performance but also the dominance of disk noise as well as a concentration of the disk noise at the track edges. Peak-jitter evaluations of offtrack and squeeze behavior clearly demonstrate the narrow-track capabilities of these recording heads for high areal density operation.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/20.102871","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/20.102871","startPage":"2948","endPage":"2953","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel1/20/3180/00102871.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3180","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance study and analysis of dual-element head on thin-film disk for gigabit-density recording","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1990","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1990","displayDocTitle":"Performance study and analysis of dual-element head on thin-film disk for gigabit-density recording","publicationDate":"Nov. 1990","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","volume":"26","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"3847911","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/102871/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance study and analysis of dual-element head on thin-film disk for gigabit-density recording","sourcePdf":"00102871.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.030758S","chronDate":"Nov.  1990","isNumber":"3180","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"11","articleId":"102871","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":102872,"authors":[{"name":"R.

Poor rise times can cause severe distortion and loss of performance at high data rates. A simple reluctance model is developed to explore the relationship between the geometry of a head and its inductance. The model is extended to include the effects of eddy currents, and to allow the frequency-dependent efficiency (hence the field rise time) to be calculated. Based on this rise time, a geometric model is used to calculate the positions of the recorded transitions and the resulting transition-shift distortion. Experimental results at transition separations down to 6 ns reveal a strong write current dependency which is not seen in the model. This dependence is, however, clearly seen in a simple domain wall model which implicitly includes magnetic saturation. Transition shift distortion can be mitigated by the use of precompensation. It is found that it is possible to successfully recover data at 180 Mbit/s using a conventional thin-film head.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1990","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/102872/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1990","volume":"26","issue":"6","accessionNumber":"3847912","publicationDate":"Nov. 1990","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Considerations for high data rate recording with thin-film heads","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Considerations for high data rate recording with thin-film heads","sourcePdf":"00102872.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.032964S","chronDate":"Nov.  1990","isNumber":"3180","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"59","articleId":"102872","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":102903,"authors":[{"name":"J.

It is shown that at high densities the performance of conventional detectors such as a peak detector, a threshold detector with partial response equalization, a decision feedback equalizer, and a Viterbi algorithm detector tuned to a linearly truncated channel fall far below the optimum performance that can be achieved by the maximum-likelihood sequence detector (MLSD). It is shown that while implementing the full MLSD is clearly out of the question for high densities with severe intersymbol interference (ISI), there exists an efficient detection scheme which achieves an excellent compromise between hardware complexity and detection performance. This scheme, which is called the fixed-delay tree search with decision feedback, combines a fast and efficient tree-search algorithm with a decision feedback equalizer to cancel out a portion of ISI without noise enhancement. It is well suited for run-length-limited systems and attains performance close to that of MLSD while maintaining reasonable implementation cost and processing requirements.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/20.102903","startPage":"3155","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel1/20/3180/00102903.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/20.102903","endPage":"3172","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3180","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance comparison of detection methods in magnetic recording","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/102903/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1990","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1990","displayDocTitle":"Performance comparison of detection methods in magnetic recording","volume":"26","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"3847937","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Nov. 1990","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance comparison of detection methods in magnetic recording","sourcePdf":"00102903.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.062168S","chronDate":"Nov.  1990","isNumber":"3180","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"164","articleId":"102903","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":102931,"authors":[{"name":"E.F.

A general theoretical treatment of such systems shows that one may expect, besides a high energy product (BH)/sub max/, a reversible demagnetization curve (exchange-spring) and, in certain cases, an unusually high isotropic remanence ratio B/sub r//J/sub s/, while the required volume fraction of the hard phase may be very low, on the order of 10%.

The oscillator can also be quasi-optically injection-locked to an external signal. The planar grid structure is very simple. All of the devices share the same bias, and they can be power and frequency tuned with a mirror behind the grid or dielectric slabs in front of it. An equivalent circuit for an infinite grid predicts the mirror frequency tuning. The planar property of the oscillator offers the possibility of a wafer-scale monolithically integrated source.

Currently, efficient optical-to-microwave conversion is extremely difficult, as the detected microwave signal is weak and noisy. A novel circuit, containing a high-gain/low-noise microwave injection-locked oscillator, has been developed to improve the interface between the optical and microwave components. The circuit utilizes two FETs and a dielectric resonator, which serves as a frequency-dependent feedback element. The circuit, designed to operate at about 8 GHz, provides significant amplitude and phase noise suppression. In addition, the circuit realization is compatible with MMIC technology.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pdfPath":"/iel1/22/3182/00102961.pdf","startPage":"201","endPage":"208","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3182","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/22.102961","doi":"10.1109/22.102961","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=102961","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Injection-locked oscillators","Optical feedback","Optical resonators","Optical modulation","Microwave antenna arrays","Phased arrays","Optical arrays","Optical noise","Circuits","Receiving antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna phased arrays","dielectric resonators","feedback","microwave oscillators","MMIC","optical communication equipment"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["active T/R module connection","amplitude noise suppression","optical/microwave conversion","optically fed antenna","low noise microwave oscillation","SHF","optical feed/microwave circuit interface","double-stage","injection-locked oscillator","phased array antennas","microwave carrier signal","modulated lightwave","high-gain","FETs","dielectric resonator","frequency-dependent feedback element","phase noise suppression","MMIC technology","8 GHz"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/102961/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1991","displayDocTitle":"A double-stage injection-locked oscillator for optically fed phased array antennas","accessionNumber":"3891210","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Feb. 1991","volume":"39","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A double-stage injection-locked oscillator for optically fed phased array antennas","sourcePdf":"00102961.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.051321S","chronDate":"Feb 1991","isNumber":"3182","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"15","articleId":"102961","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":102962,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

Possible applications include nondissipative structures of arbitrary anisotropic media with, in some cases, inhomogeneous exterior regions. The method is based on the full vectorial finite-element formulation, which is known to be without spurious solutions. With this formulation all appropriate boundary and interelement conditions on both tangential and normal components are a priori satisfied. For the unbounded, exterior region a novel type of asymptotically correct approximation on infinite elements is proposed that simultaneously, for each mode and frequency, locally adapts the rate of radial decay to the transversal wavenumbers. The linearity of the original finite-element method has been retained by using beta /k/sub 0/ as a parameter, which results in a sparse generalized eigenvalue problem. Numerical examples including both optical fibers and integrated optical waveguides, isotropic as well as anisotropic, have been analyzed to confirm the validity of the method. The observed correspondence with analytical solutions has been excellent. For some examples a special near-field wavenumber has been added to preserve a high accuracy close to cutoff.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A modified finite-element method for dielectric waveguides using an asymptotically correct approximation on infinite elements","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","doi":"10.1109/22.102968","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel1/22/3182/00102968.pdf","startPage":"258","endPage":"266","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/22.102968","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3182","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=102968","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/102968/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1991","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1991","displayDocTitle":"A modified finite-element method for dielectric waveguides using an asymptotically correct approximation on infinite elements","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"39","issue":"2","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Feb. 1991","accessionNumber":"3891217","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A modified finite-element method for dielectric waveguides using an asymptotically correct approximation on infinite elements","sourcePdf":"00102968.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.097233S","chronDate":"Feb 1991","isNumber":"3182","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"9","articleId":"102968","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":102973,"authors":[{"name":"S.J.

Overall, the latter design gives superior performance.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/22.102973","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel1/22/3182/00102973.pdf","startPage":"294","endPage":"300","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/22.102973","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3182","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Wide-band orthomode transducers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=102973","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1991","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/102973/","displayDocTitle":"Wide-band orthomode transducers","volume":"39","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 1991","accessionNumber":"3891222","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wide-band orthomode transducers","sourcePdf":"00102973.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044471S","chronDate":"Feb 1991","isNumber":"3182","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"80","articleId":"102973","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":102975,"authors":[{"name":"C.-Y.

Likelihood-ratio-based confidence intervals have much more symmetric error rates which are not as extremely anti-conservative as normal-theory intervals can be.

The authors derive new upper and lower bounds on the estimation variance which are applicable to IS techniques.

Thus, lower and upper bounds on the improvement ratio of various IS techniques relative to the direct Monte Carlo simulation are also available. These bounds are shown to be useful and computationally simple to obtain. Based on the proposed technique, one can readily find practical suboptimum IS parameters. Numerical results indicate that these bounding techniques are useful for IS simulations of linear and nonlinear communication systems with intersymbol interference in which bit error rate and IS estimation variances cannot be obtained readily using prior techniques.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/26.103032","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/26/3184/00103032.pdf","startPage":"1413","endPage":"1417","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.103032","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3184","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Estimation variance bounds of importance sampling simulations in digital communication systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/103032/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1991","displayDocTitle":"Estimation variance bounds of importance sampling simulations in digital communication systems","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4088401","volume":"39","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 1991","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Estimation variance bounds of importance sampling simulations in digital communication systems","sourcePdf":"00103032.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.042094S","chronDate":"Oct 1991","isNumber":"3184","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"19","articleId":"103032","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":103039,"authors":[{"name":"P.

The resolvable components in a number of experimentally measured pulse responses of indoor factory radio channels were used to estimate the channel statistics. The interarrival times of the signals were modeled by the Weibull distribution. A model for the distribution of signals was presented using the modified beta distribution. The path gain coefficients were represented using the Rayleigh, Rician, or log-normal distributions.

A sensor array with a translation invariance structure is assumed, and an extension of the ESPRIT algorithm for narrowband emitter signals is obtained. The emitter signals are modeled as the stationary output of a finite-dimensional linear system driven by white noise. The array response to a unit impulse from a given direction is represented as the impulse response of a linear system. The measured data from the sensor array can then be seen as the output of a multidimensional linear system driven by white noise sources and corrupted by additive noise. The emitter signals and the array output are characterized by the modes of the linear system. The ESPRIT algorithm is applied at the poles of the system, the power of the signals sharing the pole is captured, and the effect of noise is reduced. The algorithm requires no knowledge, storage, or search of the array manifold, as opposed to wideband extensions of the MUSIC algorithm. This results in a computationally efficient algorithm that is insensitive to array perturbations. Simulations are presented comparing the wideband and ESPRIT algorithm to the modal signal subspace method and the coherent signal subspace method.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/29.103067","startPage":"317","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel1/29/3185/00103067.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/29.103067","endPage":"327","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3185","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Direction-of-arrival estimation for wide-band signals using the ESPRIT algorithm","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/103067/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1990","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1990","displayDocTitle":"Direction-of-arrival estimation for wide-band signals using the ESPRIT algorithm","volume":"38","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"3641549","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Feb. 1990","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Direction-of-arrival estimation for wide-band signals using the ESPRIT algorithm","sourcePdf":"00103067.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033511S","chronDate":"Feb 1990","isNumber":"3185","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"29","citationCount":"65","articleId":"103067","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":103071,"authors":[{"name":"Y.H.

In particular, it is shown that a scaling operation in the CZT algorithm can be conveniently implemented with a norm correction (normalization) computation, which is often considered as an overhead in the CORDIC algorithm. Furthermore, since the desired frequencies of CZT are specified before computation, it is possible to reduce the total number of CORDIC iterations by finding a most economical representation of the angle in terms of the elementary CORDIC rotation angles. A simple suboptimal solution is proposed to solve this difficult optimization problem. This implementation is most effective when very few complex frequencies on the Z plane are to be evaluated via CZT.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/29.103071","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/29.103071","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel1/29/3185/00103071.pdf","startPage":"352","endPage":"354","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3185","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel implementation of a chirp Z-transform using a CORDIC processor","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/103071/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1990","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1990","displayDocTitle":"A novel implementation of a chirp Z-transform using a CORDIC processor","volume":"38","issue":"2","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 1990","accessionNumber":"3641552","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel implementation of a chirp Z-transform using a CORDIC processor","sourcePdf":"00103071.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033694S","chronDate":"Feb 1990","isNumber":"3185","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"29","citationCount":"27","articleId":"103071","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":103073,"authors":[{"name":"J.

The distinctive feature of the MDF adaptive filter is to allow one to choose the size of an FFT tailored to the efficient use of the hardware, rather than the requirements of a specific application.

In performance, the MDF adaptive filter introduces smaller block delay and is faster, making it ideal for a time-varying application such as modeling an acoustic path in a teleconference room. This is achieved by using a smaller block size, updating the weight vectors more often, and reducing the total execution time of the adaptive process.

A new eigenspace-based approach which uses projections onto a particular vector or vector set in the estimated noise-only subspace is described. Several CLOSEST vector estimators are developed by using different measures of closeness. First CLOSEST is a novel full-dimensional element-space approach to spatial-spectrum estimation which has important performance advantages relative to pertinent established spatial-spectrum estimators. It incorporates a priori knowledge of the array manifold over a location sector of interest to provide SNR spectral-resolution thresholds which are lower than those of MIN-NORM (for some arrays, substantially lower). Second, relationships between the CLOSEST approach and several established approaches to spatial-spectrum estimation are established. For a linear equispaced array, MIN-NORM is shown to be a special case of the CLOSEST-approach-one which is based on projection onto a noise-only subspace vector which is close to the array manifold over the entire field of view.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/29.103086","startPage":"1842","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel1/29/3186/00103086.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/29.103086","endPage":"1852","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3186","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spatial-spectrum estimation in a location sector","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/103086/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1990","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1990","displayDocTitle":"Spatial-spectrum estimation in a location sector","volume":"38","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"3825944","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Nov. 1990","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spatial-spectrum estimation in a location sector","sourcePdf":"00103086.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.028442S","chronDate":"Nov 1990","isNumber":"3186","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"29","citationCount":"90","articleId":"103086","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":103088,"authors":[{"name":"J.G.

In addition, the method offers a direct means of controlling the overall reconstruction distortion T(z) by appropriate design of a low-pass prototype filter P(z). Extension of these results to multiband band-limited signals and to the case of nonconsecutive nonuniform subsampling are also summarized, along with generalizations to the multidimensional case. Design examples are included to demonstrate the theory, and the complexity of the new method is seen to be much lower than earlier ones.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/29.103094","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel1/29/3186/00103094.pdf","startPage":"1927","endPage":"1936","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/29.103094","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3186","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient reconstruction of band-limited sequences from nonuniformly decimated versions by use of polyphase filter banks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=103094","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1990","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1990","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/103094/","displayDocTitle":"Efficient reconstruction of band-limited sequences from nonuniformly decimated versions by use of polyphase filter banks","volume":"38","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 1990","accessionNumber":"3825952","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient reconstruction of band-limited sequences from nonuniformly decimated versions by use of polyphase filter banks","sourcePdf":"00103094.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.059789S","chronDate":"Nov 1990","isNumber":"3186","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"29","citationCount":"50","articleId":"103094","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":103097,"authors":[{"name":"K.M.

Information theoretic criteria provide a means to achieve this. Two commonly used criteria are the Akaike information criterion (AIC) and minimum descriptive length (MDL) criterion. While the AIC tends to overestimate even at a high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), the MDL criterion tends to underestimate at low or moderate SNR. By excluding irrelevant parameters, a new log likelihood function has been chosen. Utilizing this new log likelihood function gives a set of more accurate estimates of the eigenvalues and in the establishment of modified information theoretic criteria which moderate the performance of the AIC and the MDL criterion.

The AM RF packaging techniques and the pertinent concerns for future tailoring of the system format for taboo channel utilization for broadcast-compatible terrestrial HDTV delivery in 6 MHz are highlighted. Without the constraint of direct NTSC compatibility with this system, carriers may be suppressed and standard NTSC sync headroom may be eliminated. Due to time expansion of all video components, there is a built-in advantage in multipath/echo performance, particularly beneficial for the cable short-echo scenario. The system is naturally expandable to permit an increase in resolution in the presence of additional channel bandwidth. This simulcast format is linked to a linear analog subband subsampling scheme used as a cornerstone for all HDS/NA analog transmission systems, including satellite (FSS and DBS) and augmentation terrestrial and cable formats. The generic HDS/NA subsampling scheme and the packaging of the components for a 6-MHz AM environment are described.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/30.103119","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel1/30/3187/00103119.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/30.103119","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3187","startPage":"161","endPage":"171","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"HDS/NA-6: an analog simulcast high definition television system","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=103119","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"HDS/NA-6: an analog simulcast high definition television system","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1990","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/103119/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1990","isJournal":true,"volume":"36","issue":"3","publicationDate":"Aug. 1990","accessionNumber":"3804042","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"HDS/NA-6: an analog simulcast high definition television system","sourcePdf":"00103119.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.046552S","chronDate":"Aug 1990","isNumber":"3187","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"30","citationCount":"1","articleId":"103119","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":103122,"authors":[{"name":"S.

As few as two lines need be added, amounting to 0.76% redundancy, and they can be computed by the addition and subtraction of field lines, a special case of vertical (comb) filtering. The predicted performance in the presence of background and impulse noise is good, and is verified by computations on NTSC fields.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/30.103126","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel1/30/3187/00103126.pdf","startPage":"223","endPage":"229","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/30.103126","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3187","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Compatible analog coding of television signals for correction of transmission burst errors: a computer evaluation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1990","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/103126/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1990","displayDocTitle":"Compatible analog coding of television signals for correction of transmission burst errors: a computer evaluation","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"3814505","volume":"36","issue":"3","publicationDate":"Aug. 1990","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Compatible analog coding of television signals for correction of transmission burst errors: a computer evaluation","sourcePdf":"00103126.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.0388S","chronDate":"Aug 1990","isNumber":"3187","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"30","citationCount":"4","articleId":"103126","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":103139,"authors":[{"name":"U.

The processor executes statistically scheduled data flow programs. To this end, all communication-whether between cells or between processors-is data-driven (as opposed to clock-driven). Self-timed hardware mechanisms that handle the synchronous data flows automatically and transparently are provided. The technology enables the integration of 1.2 million transistors on a single chip, and clock rates up to 125 MHz.

The systolizable structure consists of pipelineable regular modules with local connections and is suitable for VLSI implementation. It is capable of achieving high performance as well as high throughput. This class of filter structure provides certain degrees of freedom that can be used to obtain some desirable properties for the filter. Techniques of evaluating the internal signal powers and the output roundoff noise of the proposed filter structure are developed. Based upon these techniques, a well-scaled IIR digital filter with minimum output roundoff noise is designed with a local optimization approach. The internal signals of all the modes of this filter are scaled to unity in the l/sup 2/-norm sense. Compared to the Rao-Kailath (1984) orthogonal digital filter and the Gray-Markel (1973) normalized-lattice digital filter, this filter has better scaling properties and lower output roundoff noise.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/103217/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1990","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1990","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"37","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 1990","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"3825916","displayDocTitle":"A class of systolizable IIR digital filters and its design for proper scaling and minimum output roundoff noise","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A class of systolizable IIR digital filters and its design for proper scaling and minimum output roundoff noise","sourcePdf":"00103217.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037884S","chronDate":"Oct 1990","isNumber":"3188","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"31","citationCount":"13","articleId":"103217","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":103221,"authors":[{"name":"A.N.

The results address the stability properties of equilibrium points and estimates of trajectory properties. A design method is devised for this class of neural networks to establish desired relationships between scalar-valued analog input signals and output signals in binary form. The applicability of the design methodology is demonstrated by means of several specific examples, including the design of an A/D converter, the design of a resistor sorter, and the design of a resister tolerancer.

Curves and surfaces can be defined either parametrically or implicitly, with the latter representation used here. A planar curve is the set of zeros of a smooth function of two variables x-y, a surface is the set of zeros of a smooth function of three variables x-y-z, and a space curve is the intersection of two surfaces, which are the set of zeros of two linearly independent smooth functions of three variables x-y-z For example, the surface of a complex object in 3-D can be represented as a subset of a single implicit surface, with similar results for planar and space curves. It is shown how this unified representation can be used for object recognition, object position estimation, and segmentation of objects into meaningful subobjects, that is, the detection of 'interest regions' that are more complex than high curvature regions and, hence, more useful as features for object recognition.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/34.103273","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel1/34/3191/00103273.pdf","startPage":"1115","endPage":"1138","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/34.103273","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3191","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Estimation of planar curves, surfaces, and nonplanar space curves defined by implicit equations with applications to edge and range image segmentation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/103273/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1991","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1991","displayDocTitle":"Estimation of planar curves, surfaces, and nonplanar space curves defined by implicit equations with applications to edge and range image segmentation","volume":"13","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 1991","accessionNumber":"4093254","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Estimation of planar curves, surfaces, and nonplanar space curves defined by implicit equations with applications to edge and range image segmentation","sourcePdf":"00103273.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.042332S","chronDate":"Nov 1991","isNumber":"3191","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"741","articleId":"103273","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":103274,"authors":[{"name":"K.

The decomposition method can be regarded as a way of including knowledge about the structure and parameters of unmodeled dynamics in the adaptive system, making it possible to choose a lower order controller which is only equipped for the nominal process part. To illustrate the decomposition method, an adaptive controller for a scale model of a gantry crane is presented. Simplifying and linearizing the mathematical equations describing the crane yields a fourth-order model, of which the dynamics of the load swing take two. A standard adaptive control algorithm needs eight parameters, which in practice yields unacceptable behavior.

In addition, real-time implementation of the vision system in which multiple central processors are used for parallel processing of the algorithms is described.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/41.103429","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel1/41/3197/00103429.pdf","startPage":"349","endPage":"357","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/41.103429","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3197","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A vision system for an automatic assembly machine of electronic components","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=103429","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1990","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1990","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/103429/","displayDocTitle":"A vision system for an automatic assembly machine of electronic components","volume":"37","issue":"5","publicationDate":"Oct. 1990","accessionNumber":"3791425","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A vision system for an automatic assembly machine of electronic components","sourcePdf":"00103429.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034098S","chronDate":"Oct 1990","isNumber":"3197","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"8","articleId":"103429","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":103431,"authors":[{"name":"S.

This approach assumes that one has available nominal controller parameter settings through some classical tuning technique (Ziegler-Nichols, Kalman, etc.). By using an appropriate fuzzy matrix (similar to Macvicar-Whelan matrix), it is possible to determine small changes on these values during the system operation, and these lead to improved performance of the transient and steady behavior of the closed-loop system. This is achieved at the expense of some small extra computational effort, which can be very easily undertaken by a microprocessor.

Using the transformation theory of nonlinear systems, a feedback control law, which is shown to compensate for the system nonlinearities, is derived. Conditions under which such a control law is possible are presented. The need for the derivation of explicit commutation strategies is eliminated, resulting in reduction of the computations involved.

The inclusion of the robust controller results in good tracking performance when there are modeling and measurement errors and payload uncertainties.

In this approach, each joint actuator is treated as a simple inertial system plus a disturbance torque representing all the unmodeled dynamics. By a very simple algorithm, the disturbance is instantly estimated and rejected, thus allowing a simple proportional-derivative (PD) control scheme to be used. The stability of the proposed control law is analyzed. Experimental evaluations of the controller on a microcomputer-controlled PUMA 560 arm were performed. It is shown that the control scheme is simple and practical and that it can be easily implemented on an industrial manipulator presently in use.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/41.103479","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel1/41/3199/00103479.pdf","startPage":"21","endPage":"25","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/41.103479","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3199","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust independent joint controller design for industrial robot manipulators","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/103479/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1991","displayDocTitle":"Robust independent joint controller design for industrial robot manipulators","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"3878670","volume":"38","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Feb. 1991","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust independent joint controller design for industrial robot manipulators","sourcePdf":"00103479.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.056146S","chronDate":"Feb 1991","isNumber":"3199","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"162","articleId":"103479","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":103481,"authors":[{"name":"Marn Go Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Seoul, South Korea"],"lastName":"Marn Go Kim","id":"37087163163"},{"name":"Myung Joong Youn","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Seoul, South Korea"],"lastName":"Myung Joong Youn","id":"37087145342"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0278-0046"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9948"}],"articleNumber":"103481","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":29,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":283},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Industrial Electronics Society","url":"http://ieee-ies.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Time domain analysis","Time series analysis","Resonance","Voltage control","Stability analysis","Control systems","Capacitance","Inductors","Diodes","Pulse amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power convertors","time-domain analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discrete time domain analysis","noninner feedback control","inner feedback control","discrete time domain modeling","controlled series resonant converter","stability","dynamic characteristics"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=103481","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A discrete time domain modeling and analysis of controlled series resonant converter","doi":"10.1109/41.103481","startPage":"32","endPage":"40","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel1/41/3199/00103481.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3199","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/41.103481","abstract":"A discrete time domain modeling and analysis technique applicable to all types of inner-feedback and noninner-feedback-controlled series resonant converter (SRC) is presented.

However, if the grouping is inappropriate, the partitioning results may degenerate. To prevent degeneration, a ratio cut approach is used to do the grouping. By a series of experiments based on the tradeoff between cut weight and CPU time, the value which controls the resultant number of groups is determined.

These link metrics can then be used for efficient bandwidth management, routing, and call control procedures aimed at optimizing network usage.

Hahne and R.G. Gallager (1986) and M.G.H. Katevenis (1987), for fairly allocating link capacity in a point-to-point packet network with virtual circuit routing. Each link offers its packet transmission slots to its user sessions by polling them in round-robin order. In addition, window flow control is used to prevent excessive packet queues at the network nodes. As the window size increases, the session throughput rates are shown to approach limits that are perfectly fair in the max-min sense. If each session has periodic input (perhaps with jitter) or has such heavy demand that packets are always waiting to enter the network, then a finite window size suffices to produce perfectly fair throughput rates. The results suggest that the transmission capacity not used by the small window session will be approximately fairly divided among the large window sessions. The focus is on the worst-case performance of round-robin scheduling with windows.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/49.103550","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/49/3202/00103550.pdf","startPage":"1024","endPage":"1039","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/49.103550","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3202","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Round-robin scheduling for max-min fairness in data networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=103550","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1991","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/103550/","displayDocTitle":"Round-robin scheduling for max-min fairness in data networks","volume":"9","issue":"7","publicationDate":"Sept. 1991","accessionNumber":"4092495","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Round-robin scheduling for max-min fairness in data networks","sourcePdf":"00103550.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.050118S","chronDate":"Sep 1991","isNumber":"3202","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"203","articleId":"103550","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-20"},{"_id":103556,"authors":[{"name":"H.J.

When realistic data are applied to simple models of LAN interconnection, it is observed that during periods, congestion persists and losses can be significant; congestion losses cannot be avoided by modest increases in buffer capacity; consequences of misengineering can be serious; and, fortunately, most congested periods are preceded by signs of impending danger.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/103559/","volume":"9","issue":"7","publicationDate":"Sept. 1991","accessionNumber":"4092504","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1991","displayDocTitle":"Local area network characteristics, with implications for broadband network congestion management","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Local area network characteristics, with implications for broadband network congestion management","sourcePdf":"00103559.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.031867S","chronDate":"Sep 1991","isNumber":"3202","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"192","articleId":"103559","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":103618,"authors":[{"name":"W.

A mathematical model is developed to simulate the machine with its terminal capacitor. With the aid of a least-square-error method, this model is used to optimize the machine parameters. The capacitance excitation requirements for different load conditions are then computed using a steady-state model. The comparison of the transient responses shows that the terminal-capacitor excitation method has several advantages over the load excitation method. It reduces the first rotor swing and gives more damping to the subsequent rotor oscillations. It also increases the critical fault-clearing time and hence the transient stability limits. In addition, it suppresses all power frequency torque oscillations, which are quite pronounced when load excitation is used.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/60.103646","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion","startPage":"714","endPage":"720","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion","pdfPath":"/iel3/60/3205/00103646.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/60.103646","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3205","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Effect of excitation capacitors on transient performance of reluctance generators","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Capacitors","Power system transients","Power system modeling","Power system simulation","Capacitance","Reluctance generators","Mathematical model","Computational modeling","Optimization methods","Steady-state"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electric generators","power capacitors","rotors","stability","transient response"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["excitation capacitors","transient performance","reluctance generators","transient responses","infinite power system","terminal capacitances","load excitation","mathematical model","least-square-error method","steady-state model","rotor swing","damping","rotor oscillations","critical fault-clearing time","transient stability limits","power frequency torque oscillations"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Geoscience"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1991","displayDocTitle":"Effect of excitation capacitors on transient performance of reluctance generators","volume":"6","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4104325","publicationDate":"Dec. 1991","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/103646/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Effect of excitation capacitors on transient performance of reluctance generators","sourcePdf":"00103646.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.048841S","chronDate":"Dec 1991","isNumber":"3205","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"60","citationCount":"8","articleId":"103646","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":103647,"authors":[{"name":"M.A. Alhamadi","affiliation":["ECE Department, Clarkson University, Potsdam, NY, USA"],"firstName":"M.A.","lastName":"Alhamadi","id":"37296451500"},{"name":"N.A.

This difficulty is overcome by the use of multiple cross-sectional 2-D finite-element field computations, coupled with a concept of an artificial mutual-coupling inductance between the armature phase windings and the rotor-mounted permanent magnets for induced EMF and torque computations.

The study was done to understand the mechanisms involved in the loss and subsequent recovery of surface hydrophobicity due to dry-band arcing and to investigate various experimental techniques which could be used for characterizing surface hydrophobicity. The materials are subjected to dry-band arcing in a log chamber. Several techniques such as measurement of contact angle, determining surface composition using electron spectroscopy for chemical analysis (ESCA), and measuring crossover voltage (COV) using a scanning electron microscope are examined. The experimental results and theoretical calculations demonstrate that the mobile species in the polymer are responsible for the surface hydrophobicity. In terms of repeatability and simplicity of measurement, the COV determination appears to be the most suitable technique for hydrophobicity studies.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/61.103689","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","pdfPath":"/iel3/61/3206/00103689.pdf","startPage":"1923","endPage":"1933","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/61.103689","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3206","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Surface hydrophobicity of polymers used for outdoor insulation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=103689","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1990","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1990","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/103689/","displayDocTitle":"Surface hydrophobicity of polymers used for outdoor insulation","volume":"5","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Oct. 1990","accessionNumber":"3805316","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Surface hydrophobicity of polymers used for outdoor insulation","sourcePdf":"00103689.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043181S","chronDate":"Oct 1990","isNumber":"3206","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"61","citationCount":"109","articleId":"103689","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":103717,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The focus is on the downlink (from base station to portable), which is a more challenging problem technically than the uplink for two reasons. First, the complexity of the portable receiver is much more constrained than that of the base station, due to power consumption and cost restrictions. Second, the downlink data rates are likely to be much higher than the uplink rates, because downlink communication will include downloading large executable files and possibly video services, whereas uplink communication will be used for transferring working files and keyboard commands which tend to be much smaller.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/65.103810","publicationTitle":"IEEE Network","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Network","pdfPath":"/iel3/65/3209/00103810.pdf","startPage":"44","endPage":"54","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/65.103810","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3209","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High-speed nondirective optical communication for wireless networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/103810/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1991","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1991","displayDocTitle":"High-speed nondirective optical communication for wireless networks","volume":"5","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 1991","accessionNumber":"4109779","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High-speed nondirective optical communication for wireless networks","sourcePdf":"00103810.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.099452S","chronDate":"Nov.  1991","isNumber":"3209","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"65","citationCount":"60","articleId":"103810","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":103858,"authors":[{"name":"Z.

A theoretical model for evaluating energy detection performance is presented. It is shown that the classical model for analytically predicting the detection performance of an energy detector is suitable when the channel noise level is assumed Gaussian distributed. However, for a channel in which the noise fluctuates, the model proposed by the authors is more applicable. In this case, to hold the probability of false alarm constant, the average detection threshold must be set at a higher level than if the noise were assumed Gaussian. It is concluded that in a channel, such as the HF channel, where the fluctuating noise level approximates a lognormal distribution, an increase in integration time could improve P/sub d/ up to a limit. This limit is a function of P/sub s//P/sub n/ and the noise characteristics.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/MILCOM.1989.103904","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Military Communications Conference, 'Bridging the Gap.

The linear transformations are chosen to minimize either a mean-squared-error or a weighted-squared-error performance criterion. Each detector can be implemented using a tapped delay line. The number of computations performed per detected bit linear in K in each case, and the resulting detectors are thus much simpler than the optimum detector.

First, the protocol accomplishes active acknowledgement with very high reliability, while consuming only a small fraction of overhead channel bandwidth for the positive acknowledgement transmissions. Second, the minislot architecture reduces the vulnerability of the network to intelligent jammers, who may attempt to attack the acquisition preamble selectively. This is accomplished with only a modest reduction in overall network capacity. Finally, the minislot architecture provides a mechanism by which variable-length data packets may be accommodated without significant increase in design complexity, thereby improving the efficiency of the network. This protocol is analyzed by means of a discrete-time Markov chain model, and throughput performance is derived for a wide range of potential minislot sizes. A fundamental limit on the throughput of perfect CDMA networks is derived for both slotted and unslotted channels and is a consequence of the burstiness of traffic and the random pairing of transmitters and receivers.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/MILCOM.1989.103918","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Military Communications Conference, 'Bridging the Gap.

It is shown via analysis and computer simulation that the algorithm is able to detect burst and transient signals, and to capture those signals with maximum attainable output SINR (signal-to-interference and -noise ratio) in environments containing severe stationary cochannel interference. In particular, it is shown that the algorithm can adapt a four-element antenna to blindly detect and capture FSK (frequency shift keying) bursts with 10-20-ms burst durations in less than 2 ms, even at low power levels ( approximately 4-dB signal-to-white-noise ratio) and in the presence of strong ( approximately 50-dB SIR) stationary interference.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/MILCOM.1989.103952","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Military Communications Conference, 'Bridging the Gap.

The weak signal assumption enables exploitation of familiar results from the theory of local optimality, from which correlation-based detectors for the presence of known weak signals in additive independent and identically distributed (IID) noise have been derived. The development here follows from the perception that a spectrum analyzer is nothing more than a number of correlators in parallel. The approach has application to any observations that are not IID Gaussian processes. Some practical situations treated here, in which signal presence detection might be better accomplished using the proposed approach, are unknown weak signals: (1) in additive non-Gaussian interference, (2) in additive colored Gaussian noise, and (3) at the output of a nonlinear system, such as a square-law device. Items (2) and (3) required the extension of correlations-based locally optimum detection theory to cover observation processes that are not necessarily signals in additive noise.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/103956/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-18 Oct 1989","conferenceDate":"15-18 Oct. 1989","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1989","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"3637163","displayDocTitle":"A technique for detecting unknown weak signals in noise that is not additive white Gaussian","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A technique for detecting unknown weak signals in noise that is not additive white Gaussian","confLoc":"Boston, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"00103956.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047201S","chronDate":"15-18 Oct 1989","isNumber":"3213","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"807","citationCount":"12","articleId":"103956","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":103976,"authors":[{"name":"R.

Two system processing options are investigated. The first is that of conventional deinterleaving followed by demodulator magnitude accumulation and soft decision bit recovery. The second is predeinterleaver soft decision, in which demodulator magnitudes are soft detected before recombination. The soft decision metric used in each case is the difference of maximums algorithm. The advantage of soft decision before deinterleaving is a significant deinterleaver memory reduction at the cost of a performance degradation. This degradation is quantified for an ideal Rayleigh fading channel by simulation for a range of chip repeats and bit energy to noise ratios. Preliminary results indicate an implementation loss of 1-4 dB or less for diversities up to 16 over the signal-to-noise ratios of interest.

The proposed receiver consists of linear matched filters cascaded with linear equalizers and postdetection diversity combining systems. The bit-error probability, which is the performance measure, is computed using the characteristic function approach and assuming a canonical receiver. The final expression is found as a function of the elements of the covariance matrix of the fading environment. The simulation results show that the superiority of this receiver over a receiver not using an equalizer is uncontestable. Moreover, even though the simplest equalizer configuration was used by introducing a moderate modification of the circuitry at the receiver, it resulted in significant improvement of the system performance.

These monolithic LNAs have achieved noise figures of 5 dB, as well as associated gains of 11 dB. These two-stage circuits both utilize 0.2*60- mu m HEMT devices for both bandpass and low-pass circuit topologies. Noise figures as low as 4.5 dB have been observed for single-stage MMIC- (monolithic-microwave-integrated-circuit) implemented LNAs, and gains in excess of 20 dB have been observed for three-stage versions of this amplifier with a 5-dB noise figure in the V band. This result represents the state-of-the-art monolithic HEMT amplifier performance for AlGaAs and pseudomorphic InGaAs materials. This MMIC amplifier can occupy about less than one-third the size of existing MIC hybrid V-band LNAs. This represents a significant size reduction and cost saving due to repeatable circuit performance with monolithic technology.

A simple classifier, designated the generalized single-cycle classifier, is developed under additive white Gaussian noise for (1) ideal, (2) unknown phase, and (3) unknown phase and epoch environments. As a specific example, the developed classifier is applied to the SQPSK/2/sup k/PSK (k>or=1) modulation classification problem. The optimum choice of cycle and the relation between the single-cycle classifier and the likelihood ratio for SQPSK/2/sup k/PSK classification are discussed.

The experimental modulator is a fully differential circuit that operates from a single 5-V power supply and does not require calibration or component trimming.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel1/4/3216/00104165.pdf","startPage":"1746","endPage":"1756","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","doi":"10.1109/4.104165","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/4.104165","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3216","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=104165","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 50-MHz multibit sigma-delta modulator for 12-b 2-MHz A/D conversion","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Delta-sigma modulation","Circuits","Sampling methods","CMOS technology","Noise shaping","Analog-digital conversion","Very large scale integration","Dynamic range","Calibration","Instruments"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analogue-digital conversion","CMOS integrated circuits","modulators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cascaded modulator","12 bit conversion","ADC","multibit sigma-delta modulator","A/D conversion","oversampling techniques","CMOS technology","fully differential circuit","single 5-V power supply","50 MHz","2 to 2.1 MHz","5 V","1 micron"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/104165/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1991","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1991","displayDocTitle":"A 50-MHz multibit sigma-delta modulator for 12-b 2-MHz A/D conversion","volume":"26","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 1991","accessionNumber":"4103548","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 50-MHz multibit sigma-delta modulator for 12-b 2-MHz A/D conversion","sourcePdf":"00104165.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038818S","chronDate":"Dec 1991","isNumber":"3216","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"137","articleId":"104165","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":104166,"authors":[{"name":"B.M.J.

A feedback field-plate amplifier (FFPA) is introduced to raise the sensitivity of the output amplifier to 16.2 mu V/electron in order to obtain a large enough S/N ratio to the background noise of the peripheral circuits in a video camera.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/4.104183","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel1/4/3216/00104183.pdf","startPage":"1907","endPage":"1914","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/4.104183","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3216","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 1/3-in 410000-pixel CCD image sensor with feedback field-plate amplifier","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=104183","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1991","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/104183/","displayDocTitle":"A 1/3-in 410000-pixel CCD image sensor with feedback field-plate amplifier","volume":"26","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 1991","accessionNumber":"4108505","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 1/3-in 410000-pixel CCD image sensor with feedback field-plate amplifier","sourcePdf":"00104183.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.0414S","chronDate":"Dec 1991","isNumber":"3216","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"4","articleId":"104183","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":104184,"authors":[{"name":"T.

The chip performs over 2000 multiplications and additions simultaneously. Its data path is particularly suitable for the convolutional topologies that are typical in classification networks, but can also be configured for fully connected or feedback topologies. Resources can be multiplexed to permit implementation of networks with several hundreds of thousands of connections on a single chip. Computations are performed with 6 b accuracy for the weights and 3 b for the neuron states. Analog processing is used internally for reduced power dissipation and higher density, but all input/output is digital to simplify system integration. The practicality of the chip is demonstrated with an implementation of a neural network for optical character recognition.

The direct numerical solution of the appropriate frequency-domain partial differential equations is an alternative that has recently been the focus of much effort by the research community and appears to offer computational advantages over the integral equation formulations. These frequency-domain approaches require the solution of a matrix equation; the direct time-domain solution of partial differential equations offers a third formulation that does not require a matrix solution and may be more efficient for electrically large structures.

All free-space polarimetric radar cross section (RCS) and antenna measurements are subject to errors like coupling and residual reflections. The modeling of these errors results in a 12-term error correction. The procedure for the error correction with three linear independent calibration targets and an isolation measurement is shown. Based on network analysis, a single reference calibration is introduced. This single reference calibration requires the precise calculation of only one reference target.

Several applications are demonstrated.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel1/18/3220/00104319.pdf","startPage":"1586","endPage":"1594","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","doi":"10.1109/18.104319","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/18.104319","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3220","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=104319","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Universal classification for hidden Markov models","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hidden Markov models","Statistical analysis","Speech recognition","Parametric statistics","System testing","Signal detection","Helium","Digital communication","Radar applications","Sonar"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data compression","information theory","Markov processes","speech recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["universal classification","binary hypothesis testing","Neyman-Pearson formulation","hidden Markov model","HMM","asymptotically optimal decision rule","generalized likelihood ratio test","speech recognition","communication applications"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/104319/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1991","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1991","displayDocTitle":"Universal classification for hidden Markov models","volume":"37","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 1991","accessionNumber":"4083988","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Universal classification for hidden Markov models","sourcePdf":"00104319.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.046806S","chronDate":"Nov 1991","isNumber":"3220","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"7","articleId":"104319","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":104322,"authors":[{"name":"J.K.

The general problem of matching signal sets to generalized linear algebraic codes is addressed based on these codes. A definition is given for the notion of matching. It is shown that any signal set in N-dimensional Euclidean space that is matched to an abstract group is essentially what D. Slepian (1968) called a group code for the Gaussian channel. If the group is commutative, this further implies that any such signal set is equivalent to coded phase modulation with linear codes over Z/sub M/. Some further results on such signal sets are presented, and the signal sets matched to noncommutative groups and the linear codes over such groups are discussed.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Linear code","Phase modulation","Gaussian channels","Modulation coding","Hamming distance","Hamming weight","Signal to noise ratio","Signal processing","Galois fields","Linearity"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["encoding","group theory","phase modulation","phase shift keying"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["signal sets matching","commutative groups","M-PSK","linear codes","algebraic codes","N-dimensional Euclidean","abstract group","group code","phase modulation","noncommutative groups"]}],"doi":"10.1109/18.104333","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel1/18/3220/00104333.pdf","startPage":"1675","endPage":"1682","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3220","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/18.104333","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Signal sets matched to groups","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=104333","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Signal sets matched to groups","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/104333/","volume":"37","issue":"6","publicationDate":"Nov. 1991","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4088272","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1991","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1991","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Signal sets matched to groups","sourcePdf":"00104333.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.035706S","chronDate":"Nov 1991","isNumber":"3220","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"93","articleId":"104333","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":104336,"authors":[{"name":"T.

These special types of dual bases are needed for efficient implementation of (generalized) bit-serial multiplication in GF(2/sup m/). In particular, the question of choosing a polynomial basis of GF(2/sup m/), for example (1, alpha , alpha /sup 2/, alpha /sup 3/, . . ., alpha /sup m-1/), such that the change of basis matrix from the dual basis to a scalar multiple of the original basis has as few '1' entries as possible, is studied. It was previously shown by M. Wang and I. F. Blake (1990) that the optimal situation occurs when the minimal polynomial of alpha is an irreducible trinomial of degree m; then, an appropriate scalar multiple, beta , yields a change of basis matrix that is a permutation matrix. A construction is presented that often yields bases where the change of basis matrix has low weight, in the case where no irreducible trinomial of degree m exists. A simple formula can be used to compute beta and the weight of the change of basis matrix, given the minimal polynomial of alpha .<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/104343/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1991","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1991","volume":"37","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 1991","accessionNumber":"4088282","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","displayDocTitle":"On bit-serial multiplication and dual bases in GF(2/sup m/)","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On bit-serial multiplication and dual bases in GF(2/sup m/)","sourcePdf":"00104343.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033374S","chronDate":"Nov 1991","isNumber":"3220","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"17","articleId":"104343","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":104383,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Optical components, which are usually unbounded, can be handled with the help of absorbing boundary conditions. Two examples are given: a rectangular-waveguide phase-shifter and a dielectric-waveguide transformer.

The corrosion rate rapidly decreases with increasing oxygen content and reaches the minimum when the oxygen content is between 0.6 and 1.2%. The corrosion rate rapidly decreases as the carbon content increases up to about 0.06% and then gradually decreases as the carbon content increases up to about 0.1%. Further increase in the carbon content up to about 0.15% slowly increases the corrosion rate and then increases the rate substantially with further carbon increase (>0.15%). Therefore, the proper carbon content for a low corrosion rate is 0.10+or-.04%. The effect of carbon content on the corrosion rate becomes smaller when the oxygen content increases in the alloy. The effect of nitrogen content on the corrosion rate is less dramatic when it is less than 0.1%, i.e. the corrosion rate decreases with increasing nitrogen content up to 0.10% when oxygen and carbon contents are properly high, whereas the corrosion rate increases when the carbon and oxygen contents are low. If the nitrogen content exceeds 0.1% in a low C and O alloy, the corrosion rate increases dramatically.

It is noted that all such methods rely for their operation on the interaction of an electromagnetic field with the structure under test and can thus be classified as elliptic, parabolic, or hyperbolic depending upon the governing partial differential equation type describing the underlying physics. This classification has particular significance for modeling studies based on finite-element or boundary-integral analysis and also affects the solutions of the corresponding inverse or defect characterization problem. Particular attention is given to static and quasi-static field NDE (nondestructive evaluation) methods and to wave-based NDE methods. It is concluded that, although finite-element and boundary-integral solutions will separately continue to provide additional physical insight into specific NDE phenomena, it is quite possible that a hybrid approach will be necessary to integrate NDE modeling techniques successfully into the interactive, computer-based product design environment.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/104624/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1990","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1990","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"26","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 1990","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"3825632","displayDocTitle":"Electromagnetic methods of defect detection","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Electromagnetic methods of defect detection","sourcePdf":"00104624.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041686S","chronDate":"Sept.  1990","isNumber":"3221","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"11","articleId":"104624","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":104642,"authors":[{"name":"R.

It is shown that for a small amount of crosstalk, an improvement in performance over the no-interference case is possible. It is also shown that the use of the detector to counter crosstalk when only a single head is present can yield substantial gains over the case where the detection ignores crosstalk.

From a modeling point of view, one of the major characteristics of this problem is the external and uniform magnetic source (the Earth's field). A good way of taking this into account is to simulate infinity and to use the reduced scalar potential as the state function. The major difficulty in modeling ships is the presence of sophisticated 3-D geometries due to the disproportion between the global size of a ship and the thickness of the iron plates. The modeling of the thin iron plates is examined, and it is shown that an efficient method is to use line elements in 2-D and surface elements in 3-D. The authors present the finite-element formulations used, applied to scalar potentials (reduced or total). The formulations using line elements have been successfully applied, even to a magnetic region with small permeability values. Results in 2-D and comparisons with analytical solutions and actual measurements are presented.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/20.104667","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel1/20/3221/00104667.pdf","startPage":"2196","endPage":"2198","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/20.104667","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3221","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Line element for efficient computation of the magnetic field created by thin iron plates","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=104667","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1990","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1990","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/104667/","displayDocTitle":"Line element for efficient computation of the magnetic field created by thin iron plates","volume":"26","issue":"5","publicationDate":"Sept. 1990","accessionNumber":"3825670","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Line element for efficient computation of the magnetic field created by thin iron plates","sourcePdf":"00104667.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.07461S","chronDate":"Sept.  1990","isNumber":"3221","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"30","articleId":"104667","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":104669,"authors":[{"name":"T.

To achieve high inductance in a small area, magnetic core arrays with low demagnetizing factor are utilized. To increase the frequency, which is limited by the resonant frequency, the magnetic-strip core arrays are divided into three parts and each core array is excited out of phase; that is, the inductor is composed of three unit inductors connected in series with low mutual coupling. Thus, the resonant frequency of the integrated inductor is high, and high-frequency operation is possible. The experimental inductor is 3*3 mm/sup 2/ in size. The inductance is about 300 nH at 100 MHz, which is about eight times as large as that of the air-core inductor. High inductance can be easily achieved by increasing the number of strip cores with high permeability.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pdfPath":"/iel1/20/3221/00104692.pdf","startPage":"2262","endPage":"2264","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3221","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/20.104692","doi":"10.1109/20.104692","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=104692","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Thin film inductors","Magnetic films","Thin film circuits","Phased arrays","Magnetic resonance","Inductance","Magnetic cores","Resonant frequency","Demagnetization","Frequency conversion"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["inductors","magnetic circuits","magnetic cores","magnetic thin film devices"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["thin-film cloth-structured inductor","MAGIC","magnetic integrated circuit","inductance","magnetic core arrays","demagnetizing factor","magnetic-strip core arrays","air-core inductor","permeability"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1990","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/104692/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1990","displayDocTitle":"Thin film cloth-structured inductor for magnetic integrated circuit","accessionNumber":"3825691","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Sept. 1990","volume":"26","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Thin film cloth-structured inductor for magnetic integrated circuit","sourcePdf":"00104692.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033428S","chronDate":"Sept.  1990","isNumber":"3221","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"35","articleId":"104692","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":104695,"authors":[{"name":"T.

A media structure of C/CoPtCr/Cr was utilized over a range of magnetic parameters: coercivity approximately=1600-1800 Oe, remanence-thickness product approximately=0.7*10/sup -3/ emu/cm/sup 2/, and coercive squareness approximately=0.7-0.8. Media noise reduction was accomplished by optimizing the film-growth characteristics to reduce intergranular exchange coupling in the magnetic layer. The low-noise characteristics of the media are manifested in their low transition jitter values, 5 nm for 3- mu m track width, and the absence of supralinear increase in media noise power with linear density up to 3000-3500 fc/mm. The -6-dB rolloff densities are in the range 4000-5000 fc/mm. Overwrite values are typically better than 40 dB. Microstructural analysis indicates that the reduced transition noise of the present media is due to physical separation of the grains in the magnetic films, which reduces the exchange coupling between the magnetic grains. The reduced coercive squareness of the low-noise media degrades the overwrite performance and is also expected to decrease the linear density resolution of the media.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/104695/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1990","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1990","volume":"26","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 1990","accessionNumber":"3837280","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","displayDocTitle":"Longitudinal media for 1 Gb/in/sup 2/ areal density","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Longitudinal media for 1 Gb/in/sup 2/ areal density","sourcePdf":"00104695.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.048611S","chronDate":"Sept.  1990","isNumber":"3221","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"170","articleId":"104695","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":104703,"authors":[{"name":"T.D.

The electromagnetic field is described either by the three components of a magnetic vector potential and by an electric scalar potential, or by the three components of an electric vector potential and by a magnetic scalar potential. The uniqueness of the potentials is ensured by the incorporation of the Coulomb gauge and by proper boundary conditions. Owing to the correct description of the electromagnetic field, no spurious modes appear. The Galerkin equations are formulated for the finite element method leading to a generalized eigenvalue problem with symmetric, sparse matrices. This is solved by means of the bisection method with the sparsity of the matrices fully utilized.

Local texture features are evaluated in parallel by a succession of four basic operations: (1) a convolution for local structure detection (local linear transform); (2) a first nonlinearity of the form f(x)= mod x mod /sup alpha /; (3) an iterative smoothing operator; and (4) a second nonlinearity g(x). The Karhunen-Loeve transform is used to reduce the dimensionality of the resulting feature vector, and segmentation is achieved by thresholding or clustering in feature space. The combination of nonlinearities f(x)= mod x mod /sup alpha / (in particular, alpha =2) and g(x)=log x maximizes texture discrimination, and results in a description with variances approximately constant for all feature components and texture regions. This latter property improves the performance of both feature reduction and clustering algorithms significantly.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/21.105080","startPage":"804","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel1/21/3223/00105080.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/21.105080","endPage":"815","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3223","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Nonlinear operators for improving texture segmentation based on features extracted by spatial filtering","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/105080/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July-Aug.  1990","chronOrPublicationDate":"July-Aug.  1990","displayDocTitle":"Nonlinear operators for improving texture segmentation based on features extracted by spatial filtering","volume":"20","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"3758456","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"July-Aug. 1990","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Nonlinear operators for improving texture segmentation based on features extracted by spatial filtering","sourcePdf":"00105080.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.05331S","chronDate":"July-Aug.  1990","isNumber":"3223","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"21","citationCount":"47","articleId":"105080","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":105081,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

The fundamental problem is that of learning, through interaction, the best action allowed by the environment (i.e. the action that is rewarded optimally). By using running estimates of reward probabilities to learn the optimal action, an extremely efficient pursuit algorithm (PA), which is presently among the fastest algorithms known, was reported in earlier works. The improvements gained by rendering the PA discrete are investigated. This is done by restricting the probability of selecting an action to a finite and, hence, discrete subset of (0, 1). This improved scheme is proven to be epsilon -optimal in all stationary environments. Furthermore, the experimental results seem to indicate that the algorithm presented is faster than the fastest nonestimator learning automata reported to date, and also faster than the continuous pursuit automaton.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Learning automata","Vehicle dynamics","Humans","Manipulator dynamics","Neuromuscular","Pursuit algorithms","Vehicle driving","Delay effects","Damping","Aerospace control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["learning systems","probability","stochastic automata"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["stochastic learning automaton","reward probabilities","pursuit algorithm","discrete subset"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3223","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/21.105092","startPage":"931","endPage":"938","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel1/21/3223/00105092.pdf","doi":"10.1109/21.105092","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Discretized pursuit learning automata","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July-Aug.  1990","displayDocTitle":"Discretized pursuit learning automata","accessionNumber":"3746693","publicationDate":"July-Aug. 1990","volume":"20","issue":"4","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/105092/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July-Aug.  1990","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Discretized pursuit learning automata","sourcePdf":"00105092.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.052204S","chronDate":"July-Aug.  1990","isNumber":"3223","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"21","citationCount":"120","articleId":"105092","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":105172,"authors":[{"name":"T.R.

Any switch port can be cabled to any other switch port or to a host network controller. A processor in each switch monitors the network's physical configuration. A distributed algorithm running on the switch processor computes the routes packets are to follow and fills in the packet forwarding table in each switch. With Autonet, distinct paths through the set of network links can carry packets in parallel, allowing many pairs of hosts to communicate simultaneously at full link bandwidth.

For a 5-cm wheel resonator in a 7.6-cm container, Q-values of above 10/sup 5/ were found at room temperature for all of the modes in this sequence.

Phase noise measurements for a transistor oscillator locked to the n=10 (7.84-GHz) mode showed a 1/f/sup 3/ dependence for low offset frequencies, and a value of L(f)=-55 dB/Hz at an offset of 10 Hz from the carrier. The oscillator shows phase noise below the previously reported for any X-band source.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/58.105239","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","pdfPath":"/iel1/58/3228/00105239.pdf","startPage":"339","endPage":"346","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/58.105239","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3228","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Measurement and analysis of a microwave oscillator stabilized by a sapphire dielectric ring resonator for ultra-low noise","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=105239","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1990","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1990","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/105239/","displayDocTitle":"Measurement and analysis of a microwave oscillator stabilized by a sapphire dielectric ring resonator for ultra-low noise","volume":"37","issue":"5","publicationDate":"Sept. 1990","accessionNumber":"3760139","pubMedId":"18285050","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Measurement and analysis of a microwave oscillator stabilized by a sapphire dielectric ring resonator for ultra-low noise","sourcePdf":"00105239.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.0527S","chronDate":"Sept.  1990","isNumber":"3228","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"58","citationCount":"43","articleId":"105239","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":105248,"authors":[{"name":"G.

This motor consists of a 25.4-mm*12.7-mm*1.6-mm piezoelectric driving element connected between a glider base and an attached load. The device is inset in a trench to constrain motion to one dimension. An electrode on the bottom of the glider is used with an electrode on the top of the trench to implement an electrostatic clamp. This clamp enables the stepper motor to climb slopes of up to 12 degrees , whereas without the clamp only slopes of 6 degrees or less are tolerated. A linear inertial sliding motion can be achieved by expanding and contracting the piezoelectric bar, but the addition of the electrostatic clamp enhances the movement capabilities of the glider by the periodic clamping and unclamping of the glider. Glider velocities of 5.7-476 mu m/s are measured by timing the movement of the glider over a 1.0-mm portion of the track through an optical microscope. Displacement steps of 0.07-1.1 mu m are calculated by dividing the measured glider velocity by the frequency of the applied voltage pulses. Displacement step size and glider velocity are controlled by the application of PZT extension voltages ranging from +or-(60-340) V.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/105249/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1990","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1990","volume":"37","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 1990","accessionNumber":"3760146","pubMedId":"18285060","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","displayDocTitle":"A linear piezoelectric stepper motor with submicrometer step size and centimeter travel range","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A linear piezoelectric stepper motor with submicrometer step size and centimeter travel range","sourcePdf":"00105249.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.028973S","chronDate":"Sept.  1990","isNumber":"3228","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"58","citationCount":"65","articleId":"105249","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":105250,"authors":[{"name":"J.-Y.

The tissue is modeled as a collection of ideal randomly distributed scatterers, filtered by a time-invariant system representing the measurement apparatus and the average properties of the scattering medium, to obtain the backscattered signal. The gamma distribution has been assumed to describe the process, because it offers a flexible approach to approximating the parametric regularity of the scatterers. According to the model the spectral characteristics of the backscattered signal are strictly correlated with the spatial architecture and can be related to the gamma distribution parameters, i.e. interdistance and order. The model has been tested by simulating practical situations, in order to prove its validity and to test the procedure for estimating model parameters from actual data. The correspondence of experimental results obtained from tissues of different degrees of regularity with the simulated results confirms the effectiveness of the model for tissue characterization studies.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/105251/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1990","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1990","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Sept. 1990","accessionNumber":"3770776","pubMedId":"18285062","volume":"37","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Spectral characterization of tissues microstructure by ultrasounds: a stochastic approach","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spectral characterization of tissues microstructure by ultrasounds: a stochastic approach","sourcePdf":"00105251.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044813S","chronDate":"Sept.  1990","isNumber":"3228","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"58","citationCount":"83","articleId":"105251","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":105256,"authors":[{"name":"R.B.

When the tactile finger touches an unknown smooth convex surface, contact location, principal curvatures, and normal force are determined from a 4*4 window of strain measurements. Contact properties are determined by a nonlinear model-based inversion from strain measurements back to the contact type. Sensor strains are predicted by convolving the spatial impulse response of the rubber skin with the assumed surface pressure distribution derived from a Hertz contact model. Gradient search finds the parameters of the convex second-order shape and the force that best fit the sensor data. Experiments under laboratory conditions show radius estimation within 10%, orientation within 3%, and subtactel (tactile element) localization to 3% of the element spacing. Using a linearized model, error bounds due to sensor noise on the inversion process are predicted.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/70.105389","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics and Automation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel4/70/3235/00105389.pdf","startPage":"806","endPage":"817","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/70.105389","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3235","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Using a cylindrical tactile sensor for determining curvature","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=105389","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1991","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/105389/","displayDocTitle":"Using a cylindrical tactile sensor for determining curvature","volume":"7","issue":"6","publicationDate":"Dec. 1991","accessionNumber":"4104863","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Using a cylindrical tactile sensor for determining curvature","sourcePdf":"00105389.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.055643S","chronDate":"Dec 1991","isNumber":"3235","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"70","citationCount":"74","articleId":"105389","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":105391,"authors":[{"name":"M.W.

The given dimensions of the grid pattern on the plate are used to estimate the depth information of the polyhedral surfaces.

The robot is assumed to be able to autonomously traverse graph edges, recognize when it has reached a vertex, and enumerate edges incident upon the current vertex relative to the edge via which it entered the current vertex. The robot cannot measure distances, and it does not have a compass. It is demonstrated that this exploration problem is unsolvable in general without markers, and, to solve it, the robot is equipped with one or more distinct markers that can be put down or picked up at will and that can be recognized by the robot if they are at the same vertex as the robot. An exploration algorithm is developed and proven correct. Its performance is shown on several example worlds, and heuristics for improving its performance are discussed.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robotic exploration as graph construction","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics and Automation","doi":"10.1109/70.105395","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel4/70/3235/00105395.pdf","startPage":"859","endPage":"865","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/70.105395","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3235","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=105395","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/105395/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1991","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1991","displayDocTitle":"Robotic exploration as graph construction","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"7","issue":"6","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Dec. 1991","accessionNumber":"4104870","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robotic exploration as graph construction","sourcePdf":"00105395.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.025884S","chronDate":"Dec 1991","isNumber":"3235","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"70","citationCount":"171","articleId":"105395","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":105413,"authors":[{"name":"N.M.

The goal is to study response properties that are useful for extracting sound localization information from directionally selective spectral filtering provided by the pinna. For studying sound localization based on spectral cues provided by the pinna, a feedforward neural network model with a guaranteed level of fault tolerance is introduced. Fault tolerance and uniform fault tolerance in a neural network are formally defined and a method is described to ensure that the estimated network exhibits fault tolerance. The problem of estimating weights for such a network is formulated as a large-scale nonlinear optimization problem. Numerical experiments indicate that solutions with uniform fault tolerance exist for the pattern recognition problem considered. Solutions derived by introducing fault tolerance constraints have better generalization properties than solutions obtained via unconstrained back-propagation.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/105414/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1992","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1992","volume":"3","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 1992","accessionNumber":"4125685","pubMedId":"18276402","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","displayDocTitle":"Maximally fault tolerant neural networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Maximally fault tolerant neural networks","sourcePdf":"105414.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.057331S","chronDate":"Jan.  1992","isNumber":"3236","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"96","articleId":"105414","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":105415,"authors":[{"name":"L.

The network considered is a feedforward layered neural network trained with the back-propagation algorithm. Back-propagation training is viewed as nonlinear least-squares regression and the additive noise is interpreted as generating a kernel estimate of the probability density that describes the training vector distribution. Two specific application types are considered: pattern classifier networks and estimation of a nonstochastic mapping from data corrupted by measurement errors. It is not proved that the introduction of additive noise to the training vectors always improves network generalization. However, the analysis suggests mathematically justified rules for choosing the characteristics of noise if additive noise is used in training. Results of mathematical statistics are used to establish various asymptotic consistency results for the proposed method.

A convergence analysis for the training of structured networks is presented. Since the learning techniques used in structured networks are also employed in the training of neural networks, the issue of convergence is discussed not only from a numerical algebra perspective but also as a means of deriving insight into connectionist learning. Bounds on the learning rate are developed under which exponential convergence of the weights to their correct values is proved for a class of matrix algebra problems that includes linear equation solving, matrix inversion, and Lyapunov equation solving. For a special class of problems, the orthogonalized back-propagation algorithm, an optimal recursive update law for minimizing a least-squares cost functional, is introduced. It guarantees exact convergence in one epoch.

The new model, the digi-neocognitron (DNC), has the same pattern recognition performance as the NC. The DNC model is derived from the NC model by a combination of preprocessing approximation and the definition of new model functions, e.g., multiplication and division are eliminated by conversion of factors to powers of 2, requiring only shift operations. The NC model is reviewed, the DNC model is presented, a methodology to convert NC models to DNC models is discussed, and the performances of the two models are compared on a character recognition example. The DNC model has substantial advantages over the NC model for VLSI implementation. The area-delay product is improved by two to three orders of magnitude, and I/O and memory requirements are reduced by representation of weights with 3 bits or less and neuron outputs with 4 bits or 7 bits.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/105419/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1992","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4125690","pubMedId":"18276407","volume":"3","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"The digi-neocognitron: a digital neocognitron neural network model for VLSI","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The digi-neocognitron: a digital neocognitron neural network model for VLSI","sourcePdf":"00105419.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037555S","chronDate":"Jan.  1992","isNumber":"3236","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"40","articleId":"105419","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":105420,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The sensitivity of the neural network varies depending on the set of weights. For the selection of weights with lower sensitivity or for estimating output perturbations in the implementation, it is important to measure the sensitivity for the weights. A sensitivity depending on the weight set in a single-output multilayer perceptron (MLP) with differentiable activation functions is proposed. Formulas are derived to compute the sensitivity arising from additive/multiplicative weight perturbations or input perturbations for a specific input pattern. The concept of sensitivity is extended so that it can be applied to any input patterns. A few sensitivity measures for the multiple output MLP are suggested. For the verification of the validity of the proposed sensitivities, computer simulations have been performed, resulting in good agreement between theoretical and simulation outcomes for small weight perturbations.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/72.105422","startPage":"101","endPage":"107","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel4/72/3236/00105422.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/72.105422","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3236","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sensitivity analysis of multilayer perceptron with differentiable activation functions","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sensitivity analysis","Multilayer perceptrons","Neural networks","Computer simulation","Neurons","Computational modeling","Neural network hardware","Instruments"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural nets","perturbation theory","sensitivity analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multilayer perceptron","differentiable activation functions","neural network","connection weights","input-output mapping","output perturbations","sensitivity","additive/multiplicative weight perturbations","input pattern","computer simulations"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/105422/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1992","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1992","displayDocTitle":"Sensitivity analysis of multilayer perceptron with differentiable activation functions","volume":"3","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4125693","pubMedId":"18276410","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sensitivity analysis of multilayer perceptron with differentiable activation functions","sourcePdf":"00105422.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.019437S","chronDate":"Jan.  1992","isNumber":"3236","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"125","articleId":"105422","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":105424,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

It is shown that the feedforward network (FFN) pattern learning rule is a first-order approximation of the FFN-batch learning rule. As a result, pattern learning is valid for nonlinear activation networks provided the learning rate is small. For recurrent types of networks (RecNs), RecN-pattern learning is different from RecN-batch learning. However, the difference can be controlled by using small learning rates. While RecN-batch learning is strict in a mathematical sense, RecN-pattern learning is simple to implement and can be implemented in a real-time manner. Simulation results agree very well with the theorems derived. It is shown by simulation that for system identification problems, recurrent networks are less sensitive to noise.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/105425/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1992","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1992","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"3","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4125696","pubMedId":"18276413","displayDocTitle":"Comparison of four neural net learning methods for dynamic system identification","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparison of four neural net learning methods for dynamic system identification","sourcePdf":"00105425.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036881S","chronDate":"Jan.  1992","isNumber":"3236","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"144","articleId":"105425","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":105426,"authors":[{"name":"G.L.

When applied to the 'weak-membrane' objective, MFA results in an algorithm qualitatively identical to the published GNC algorithm.

The authors present a solution to this problem using a neural network machine learning approach. The method uses a neural network to predict first the number of contacts; then another neural network uses this prediction and other circuit features to predict the width and the height of its layout. The approach has produced much better results than those published-a dimension (aspect ratio) prediction average error of less than 18% with a corresponding area prediction average error of less than 15%.

Strongly code-disjoint (SCD) circuits are known to always map noncodeword inputs to noncodeword outputs, even in the presence of faults, as long as the faults remain undetected. The authors present a general design method for SFS and SCD combinational circuits for the previously proposed fault model that covers the broad classes of likely faults in VLSI. In the design, the input and output of a combinational circuit are encoded in systematic unordered codes whose check part is obtained by adding two extra bits to the check part of any known systematic unordered code. Thanks to the uniform input/output encoding and the SCD property for the proposed combinational circuits, a number of the circuits can be interconnected in cascade to construct a larger SFS combinational circuit if each interface is sufficiently exercised.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/105601/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 June 1989","publicationDate":"1989","conferenceDate":"21-23 June 1989","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"3524152","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A strongly fault-secure and strongly code-disjoint realization of combinational circuits","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A strongly fault-secure and strongly code-disjoint realization of combinational circuits","confLoc":"Chicago, IL, USA","sourcePdf":"00105601.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051315S","chronDate":"21-23 June 1989","isNumber":"3238","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"251","citationCount":"14","articleId":"105601","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":106120,"authors":[{"name":"I.S.

Examples are given to demonstrate the performance of the moving target indicator (MTI) procedure.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1990","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/106120/","volume":"26","issue":"3","publicationDate":"May 1990","accessionNumber":"3724165","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1990","displayDocTitle":"A recursive moving-target-indication algorithm for optical image sequences","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A recursive moving-target-indication algorithm for optical image sequences","sourcePdf":"00106120.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041053S","chronDate":"May 1990","isNumber":"3243","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7","citationCount":"79","articleId":"106120","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":106126,"authors":[{"name":"V.

This method relies on the identification of a three-terminal nonlinear device, called the PWM switch, which consists of only the active and passive switches in a PWM converter. Once the invariant properties of the PWM switch are determined, its average equivalent circuit model can be derived. This model is versatile enough to easily account for storage-time modulation of bipolar junction transistor(s) (BJTs); the DC- and small-signal characteristics of a large class of PWM converters can then be contained by a simply replacing the PWM switch with its equivalent circuit model. The methodology is very similar to linear amplifier circuit analysis, whereby the transistor is replaced by its equivalent circuit model.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/7/3243/00106126.pdf","startPage":"490","endPage":"496","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","doi":"10.1109/7.106126","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/7.106126","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3243","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=106126","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Simplified analysis of PWM converters using model of PWM switch.

It is shown that there is neither theoretical nor experimental justification for the disappearance of the inductor state as claimed by the method of state-space averaging. For example, when the model of the PWM switch in DCM is substituted in the buck, boost, or buck-boost converter while the inductor is left intact, the average model has two poles: the first pole f/sub p1/ agrees with the single pole of state-space averaging, while the second pole f/sub p2/ occurs in the range f/sub p2/>or=F/sub s// pi .

The local filters run in parallel, and provide sensor data compression via prefiltering. The master filter runs at a selectable reduced rate, fusing local filter outputs via efficient square root algorithms. Common local process noise correlations are handled by use of a conservative matrix upper bound. The federated filter yields estimates that are globally optimal or conservatively suboptimal, depending upon the master filter processing rate.

The basic idea of the structured network approaches is to first represent a given equation-solving problem by a 3-D structured network so that if the network matches a desired pattern array, the weights of the linear neurons give the solution to the problem: then, train the 3-D structured network to match the desired pattern array using some training algorithms; and finally, obtain the solution to the specific problem from the converged weights of the network. The training algorithms for the two 3-D structured networks are proved to converge exponentially fast to the correct solutions.

The properties of signal and gain for the sensors of low and high pixel density, respectively, are analyzed, and it is pointed out that two distinct amplifying effects can exist in the sensor simultaneously.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel1/16/3248/00106237.pdf","startPage":"1432","endPage":"1438","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","doi":"10.1109/16.106237","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/16.106237","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3248","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=106237","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel amplified image sensor with a-Si:H photoconductor and MOS transistors","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image sensors","Photoconductivity","MOSFETs","Sensor arrays","Pixel","Testing","Photoconducting devices","Dynamic range","Charge carrier processes","Signal analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amorphous semiconductors","amplifiers","elemental semiconductors","image sensors","MOS integrated circuits","photoconducting devices","silicon"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["stacked structure","photosensitivity","amplified image sensor","MOS transistors","MOS transistor array","dynamic range","configurations","gain","high pixel density","amplifying effects","16 pixel","256 pixel","0.6 micron","amorphous Si:H photoconductor"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/106237/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  1990","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  1990","displayDocTitle":"A novel amplified image sensor with a-Si:H photoconductor and MOS transistors","volume":"37","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 1990","accessionNumber":"3710802","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel amplified image sensor with a-Si:H photoconductor and MOS transistors","sourcePdf":"00106237.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.054126S","chronDate":"June  1990","isNumber":"3248","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"13","articleId":"106237","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":106247,"authors":[{"name":"D.

Theoretically, the resolution of the structure is given by the resolution of the A/D converters in the array (subconverters). In practice, however, mismatches among the subconverters lead to a decrease in the resolution. The effect of such mismatches is analyzed in terms of a signal-to-noise ratio defined as the ratio between the energy of the input analog signal and the energy of the error signal due exclusively to these mismatches. The analysis shows that the distortion is comparable to that generated by nonuniform sample timing in the analog demultiplexer when converting a single high-speed signal into several low-speed sampled-and-held signals. The results of the analysis can be used to specify the degree of precision to be achieved in an actual monolithic implementation.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/19.106306","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","pdfPath":"/iel1/19/3250/00106306.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/19.106306","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3250","startPage":"831","endPage":"835","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of mismatch effects among A/D converters in a time-interleaved waveform digitizer","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=106306","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of mismatch effects among A/D converters in a time-interleaved waveform digitizer","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/106306/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1991","isJournal":true,"volume":"40","issue":"5","publicationDate":"Oct. 1991","accessionNumber":"4093104","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of mismatch effects among A/D converters in a time-interleaved waveform digitizer","sourcePdf":"00106306.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.059177S","chronDate":"Oct 1991","isNumber":"3250","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"19","citationCount":"167","articleId":"106306","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":106330,"authors":[{"name":"T.

The effectiveness of the infinite-element method is illustrated by the accuracy and the CPU time obtained when various boundary conditions are applied.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel1/20/3251/00106330.pdf","startPage":"368","endPage":"370","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","doi":"10.1109/20.106330","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/20.106330","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3251","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=106330","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"3-D open boundary magnetic field analysis using infinite element based on hybrid finite element method","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Magnetic fields","Magnetic analysis","Finite element methods","Equations","Bandwidth","Magnetic cores","Polynomials","Boundary conditions","Boundary element methods","Coils"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["coils","finite element analysis","magnetic fields"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3D open boundary magnetic field analysis","air core coil","hybrid finite element method","bandwidth","coefficient matrix","decay parameters","infinite-element method","CPU time","boundary conditions"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/106330/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1990","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1990","displayDocTitle":"3-D open boundary magnetic field analysis using infinite element based on hybrid finite element method","volume":"26","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 1990","accessionNumber":"3711310","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"3-D open boundary magnetic field analysis using infinite element based on hybrid finite element method","sourcePdf":"00106330.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038777S","chronDate":"March  1990","isNumber":"3251","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"10","articleId":"106330","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":106331,"authors":[{"name":"Langru Li","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Power Engineering, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"lastName":"Langru Li","id":"37087254514"},{"name":"Youqin Xiang","affiliation":["Texas Accelerator Center, Woodlands, TX, USA"],"lastName":"Youqin Xiang","id":"37087255061"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9464"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0069"}],"articleNumber":"106331","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":134},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Magnetics Society","url":"http://www.ieeemagnetics.org/"}],"abstract":"The basic equations of two scalar potentials and their finite-element discretized formulations are discussed.

A procedure for solving finite element problems has been implemented on five DEC computers within such a network. The principal idea is to subdivide the whole problem into substructures and to eliminate the interior nodes of those in parallel autonomous processes by frontal techniques. The aim is to keep the resulting system of equations as small as possible, so that this resulting set of equations can be solved on one processor by ICGG (incomplete choleski conjugate gradient) method in an acceptable time. As another application of distributed processing, higher evolution strategies for optimization problems in a finite-element context have been parallelized. It is concluded that substructuring as a means of performing parallel processing on a LAN is only of interest for large 2-D problems.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/20.106445","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel1/20/3251/00106445.pdf","startPage":"827","endPage":"830","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/20.106445","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3251","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed processing of FEM in a local area network (magnetostatics)","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=106445","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1990","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1990","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/106445/","displayDocTitle":"Distributed processing of FEM in a local area network (magnetostatics)","volume":"26","issue":"2","publicationDate":"March 1990","accessionNumber":"3724207","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed processing of FEM in a local area network (magnetostatics)","sourcePdf":"00106445.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.064157S","chronDate":"March  1990","isNumber":"3251","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"4","articleId":"106445","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":106456,"authors":[{"name":"W.

The force density errors of the elements on the integration path are estimated from the differences between the computed force density and the smoothed one obtained by taking some low-frequency terms from the Fourier series expansion of the computed force density. The elements with relatively large errors are refined. Three integration paths are chosen for force density computation.

In the method, the record is divided into intervals and the measurements in each are approximated by a set of dipole field curves where the weighted residuals are minimized through the iterative technique. To convert the originally indeterminate problem into a determinate one, the weight function proportional to some positive power of the distance between the assumed location of the dipole and the point for measurement is introduced. By adjusting the exponent of the function, the estimated location of the dipole tends to converge to the middle of the interval when no signal exists, whereas it converges to the true location when the signal is included. As an example, the field signal of a small can of tin plate could be detected at a distance fifteen times its length, where the signal-to-noise ratio was nearly unity.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1990","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/106508/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1990","volume":"26","issue":"2","accessionNumber":"3711439","publicationDate":"March 1990","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Detection of magnetic anomaly signal by applying adjustable weight functions","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Detection of magnetic anomaly signal by applying adjustable weight functions","sourcePdf":"00106508.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038724S","chronDate":"March  1990","isNumber":"3251","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"3","articleId":"106508","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":106510,"authors":[{"name":"F.

The key feature of the research is a detailed demonstration of the advantages of using series feedback with experiments and simulations. This LNA shows an excellent input VSWR match under 1.4 as well as a noise figure of 1.67 dB and a gain of 24 dB at 12 GHz. The noise figure, the gain and VSWRs exhibit very little bias current dependence due to the exceptional features of the pulse-doped structure FETs and the optimized circuit design. Insensitivity to bias current implies performance stability in the face of process fluctuations. Thus, the yield of chips with noise figures of less than 2.0 dB is as high as 62.5%, and the variations of gain and VSWR are highly uniform as well.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/22.106537","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/22.106537","startPage":"1987","endPage":"1994","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel1/22/3252/00106537.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3252","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"X-band MMIC amplifier with pulse-doped GaAs MESFET's","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1991","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1991","displayDocTitle":"X-band MMIC amplifier with pulse-doped GaAs MESFET's","publicationDate":"Dec. 1991","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","volume":"39","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4108546","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/106537/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"X-band MMIC amplifier with pulse-doped GaAs MESFET's","sourcePdf":"00106537.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.052114S","chronDate":"Dec 1991","isNumber":"3252","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"18","articleId":"106537","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":106539,"authors":[{"name":"K.W.

This is illustrated by numerical results pertaining to a finned waveguide.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new finite-difference time-domain formulation and its equivalence with the TLM symmetrical condensed node","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","doi":"10.1109/22.106559","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel1/22/3252/00106559.pdf","startPage":"2160","endPage":"2169","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/22.106559","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3252","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=106559","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/106559/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1991","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1991","displayDocTitle":"A new finite-difference time-domain formulation and its equivalence with the TLM symmetrical condensed node","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"39","issue":"12","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Dec. 1991","accessionNumber":"4108568","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new finite-difference time-domain formulation and its equivalence with the TLM symmetrical condensed node","sourcePdf":"00106559.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.075782S","chronDate":"Dec 1991","isNumber":"3252","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"73","articleId":"106559","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":106561,"authors":[{"name":"W.L.

The main drawbacks of the iterative methods are the increased computational burden and the difficulty in establishing a stopping criterion and ensuring proper quantitation in different imaging situations. Using a combination of techniques, it has been possible to reduce the time required for iterative reconstruction to a few times that of FB. The quantitation properties of FB have been compared to those of additive and multiplicative iteration formulas, including the maximum likelihood method. Without acceleration, all three tested methods gave quantitative results after 40 iterations, regardless of the number of counts in the data.

This approximation is only valid when the sampled light-spread function is separable, and spatial distortion is observed when this constraint is violated. Recursive calculation of the 2-D position estimate using a sequence of one-dimensional estimates was investigated. Mean phototube response functions were computed from Monte Carlo simulations of the light-spread function, and position was estimated for scintillation events using recursive estimation. After three steps the maximum errors were mod delta x mod =0.04 mm and mod delta y mod =0.06 mm for the case of noise-free data and when mean response functions were known at each estimated location. Using response functions interpolated over 6-mm intervals gave increased distortion with average x and y errors of 0.097 and 0.082 mm, respectively.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pdfPath":"/iel1/23/3253/00106703.pdf","startPage":"713","endPage":"717","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3253","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/23.106703","doi":"10.1109/23.106703","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=106703","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Maximum likelihood estimation","Recursive estimation","Optical distortion","Solid scintillation detectors","Cameras","Optical refraction","Optical variables control","Optical arrays","Photomultipliers","Scintillation counters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomedical equipment","cameras","gamma-ray detection and measurement","Monte Carlo methods","radioisotope scanning and imaging","scintillation counters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["two-dimensional maximum likelihood position estimate","scintillation camera","gamma-ray imaging detector","one-dimensional estimates","light-spread function","spatial distortion","phototube response functions","Monte Carlo simulations","recursive estimation","maximum errors","noise-free data"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  1990","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/106703/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April  1990","displayDocTitle":"Recursive calculation of the two-dimensional maximum likelihood position estimate for a scintillation camera","accessionNumber":"3711052","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"April 1990","volume":"37","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Recursive calculation of the two-dimensional maximum likelihood position estimate for a scintillation camera","sourcePdf":"00106703.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.02643S","chronDate":"April  1990","isNumber":"3253","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"14","articleId":"106703","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":106713,"authors":[{"name":"C.W.

By bypassing the rate-limiting backprojection step of filtered backprojection, the proposed algorithm operates more quickly than previous methods. Fourier domain operations are also used to form forward-projected views of the imaged object; portions of these views are required to operate a full three-dimensional reconstruction using the cross-plane projection planes. Inaccuracies in images recovery and artifacts in the image are reduced by oversampling in the Fourier domain; this is easily accomplished by zero-padding the projection data prior to entering the Fourier domain. These Fourier domain algorithms form the basis for the reconstruction algorithm in PCR-II, a volumetric positron imager under construction at Massachusetts General Hospital.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Accelerated image reconstruction for a cylindrical positron tomograph using Fourier domain methods","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","doi":"10.1109/23.106713","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel1/23/3253/00106713.pdf","startPage":"773","endPage":"777","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/23.106713","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3253","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=106713","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/106713/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April  1990","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  1990","displayDocTitle":"Accelerated image reconstruction for a cylindrical positron tomograph using Fourier domain methods","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"37","issue":"2","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"April 1990","accessionNumber":"3724073","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Accelerated image reconstruction for a cylindrical positron tomograph using Fourier domain methods","sourcePdf":"00106713.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.029705S","chronDate":"April  1990","isNumber":"3253","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"31","articleId":"106713","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":106715,"authors":[{"name":"S.C.

In addition, TCC and NEC curves on the 933/08-12 were compared with those from an Alderson brain phantom. In general, it is found that the TCC curves indicated peak count rates and activity levels that were as much as 50% higher than the corresponding values from NEC curves. The primary factor causing this difference is the noise effect of the randoms component. It is demonstrated that, compared to the Alderson brain phantom, the standard 20-cm cylinder is a poor predictor of count rate performance for PET brain imaging.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel1/23/3253/00106715.pdf","startPage":"783","endPage":"788","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","doi":"10.1109/23.106715","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/23.106715","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3253","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=106715","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Measuring PET scanner sensitivity: relating countrates to image signal-to-noise ratios using noise equivalents counts","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Signal to noise ratio","Noise measurement","Positron emission tomography","Imaging phantoms","National electric code","Scattering","Collimators","Image reconstruction","Biomedical imaging","Image quality"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computerised tomography","radioisotope scanning and imaging"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["PET","positron emission tomography","true coincidence count","noise equivalent count","scanner-collimator combinations","tapered collimator septa","Alderson brain phantom","count rate performance","brain imaging"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/106715/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  1990","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April  1990","displayDocTitle":"Measuring PET scanner sensitivity: relating countrates to image signal-to-noise ratios using noise equivalents counts","volume":"37","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 1990","accessionNumber":"3711061","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Measuring PET scanner sensitivity: relating countrates to image signal-to-noise ratios using noise equivalents counts","sourcePdf":"00106715.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.035055S","chronDate":"April  1990","isNumber":"3253","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"440","articleId":"106715","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":106752,"authors":[{"name":"E.

Since failure is a complicated concept, four simple conceptual models for failure are discussed: stress-strength, damage-endurance, challenge-response, and tolerance-requirement. The specific failure mechanisms depend on material or structural defects, damage induced during manufacture and assembly, and on conditions during storage and field use. Conditions that affect the state of an item are broadly termed stresses (loads), e.g., mechanical stress and strain, electrical current and voltage, temperature, humidity, chemical environment, and radiation. The effects of stresses are influenced by geometry, constitutive and damage properties of the materials, manufacturing parameters, and the application environment.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/24.106769","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/24.106769","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Reliability","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Reliability","pdfPath":"/iel1/24/3254/00106769.pdf","startPage":"531","endPage":"536","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3254","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Material failure mechanisms and damage models","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/106769/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1991","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1991","displayDocTitle":"Material failure mechanisms and damage models","volume":"40","issue":"5","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 1991","accessionNumber":"4108523","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Material failure mechanisms and damage models","sourcePdf":"00106769.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.02014S","chronDate":"Dec 1991","isNumber":"3254","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"24","citationCount":"137","articleId":"106769","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":106800,"authors":[{"name":"C.K.

The authors have examined a range of conditions and report on a variety of observed phenomena. Comparisons to experiment and analytical models are made, when possible. The differences between discharges in which secondary electrons play a key role in sustaining the discharge and those in which secondary electrons are unimportant are examined in three cases which illustrate the importance of the discharge-sustaining mechanisms. Electron-energy distributions are found to be, in general, non-Maxwellian, with shapes that depend in complex ways on discharge conditions. In the absence of secondary electron emission, electron heating in the sheath regions of the discharge is enhanced at higher voltages compared to ohmic heating in the bulk of the plasma. Fast electrons accelerated by the advancing sheath can carry a substantial fraction of the conduction current in the bulk of the discharge, reducing the effective bulk ohmic heating of electrons.

In particular, an extension of the algorithm to ARMA (autoregressive moving-average) parameter estimation is presented along with a convergence analysis. The extension is similar to the extended least-squares (ELS) algorithm. However, the convergence analysis is complicated due to the discerning update strategy, which incorporates an information-dependent updating factor. The virtues of such an update strategy are more efficient use of the input data in terms of information processing and a modular adaptive filter structure which would facilitate the development of a parallel-pipelined signal processing architecture. It is shown that if the input noise is bounded and the moving-average parameters satisfy a certain magnitude bound, then the a posteriori prediction errors are uniformly bounded. With an additional persistence-of-excitation condition, the parameter estimates are shown to converge to a neighborhood of the true parameters, and the a priori prediction errors are shown to be asymptotically bounded. Simulation results show that the parameter estimation error for the EOBE algorithm is comparable to that for the ELS algorithm.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1990","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/106863/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1990","volume":"38","issue":"3","accessionNumber":"3663236","publicationDate":"March 1990","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"ARMA parameter estimation using a novel recursive estimation algorithm with selective updating","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"ARMA parameter estimation using a novel recursive estimation algorithm with selective updating","sourcePdf":"00106863.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.032093S","chronDate":"Mar 1990","isNumber":"3256","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"29","citationCount":"23","articleId":"106863","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":106864,"authors":[{"name":"I.S.

The measurement noise is allowed to be colored Gaussian or independent and identically non-Gaussian distributed. The ARMA model is not restricted to be causal or minimum phase and may even contain all-pass factors. The unique parameter estimates of both the MA and AR parts are obtained by linear equations. The structure of the proposed algorithm facilitates asymptotic performance evaluation of the parameter estimators and model order selection using cumulant statistics. The method is computationally simple and can be viewed as the least-squares solution to a quadratic model fitting of a sampled cumulant sequence. Identifiability issues are addressed. Simulations are presented to illustrate the proposed algorithm.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/29.106866","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel1/29/3256/00106866.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/29.106866","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3256","startPage":"478","endPage":"495","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On estimating noncausal nonminimum phase ARMA models of non-Gaussian processes","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=106866","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"On estimating noncausal nonminimum phase ARMA models of non-Gaussian processes","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1990","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/106866/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1990","isJournal":true,"volume":"38","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 1990","accessionNumber":"3663238","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On estimating noncausal nonminimum phase ARMA models of non-Gaussian processes","sourcePdf":"00106866.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.078784S","chronDate":"Mar 1990","isNumber":"3256","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"29","citationCount":"78","articleId":"106866","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":106872,"authors":[{"name":"K.S.

The VAX security kernel supports multiple concurrent virtual machines on a single VAX system, providing isolation and controlled sharing of sensitive data. Rigorous engineering standards were applied during development to comply with the assurance requirements for verification and configuration management. The VAX security kernel has been developed with a heavy emphasis on performance and system management tools.

McCabe, 1976) and software maintenance productivity, given that a metric that measures complexity should prove to be a useful predictor of maintenance costs, is reported. The cyclomatic complexity metric is a measure of the maximum number of linearly independent circuits in a program control graph. The current research validates previously raised concerns about the metric on a new data set. However, a simple transformation of the metric is investigated whereby the cyclomatic complexity is divided by the size of the system in source statements. thereby determining a complexity density ratio. This complexity density ratio is demonstrated to be a useful predictor of software maintenance productivity on a small pilot sample of maintenance projects.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/32.106988","startPage":"1284","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel1/32/3260/00106988.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/32.106988","endPage":"1288","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3260","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cyclomatic complexity density and software maintenance productivity","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/106988/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1991","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1991","displayDocTitle":"Cyclomatic complexity density and software maintenance productivity","volume":"17","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4093226","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Dec. 1991","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cyclomatic complexity density and software maintenance productivity","sourcePdf":"00106988.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.046833S","chronDate":"Dec 1991","isNumber":"3260","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"32","citationCount":"96","articleId":"106988","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":106999,"authors":[{"name":"B.A. Carlson","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"B.A.","lastName":"Carlson","id":"37341584500"},{"name":"M.A. Clements","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"M.A.","lastName":"Clements","id":"37272395500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0162-8828"},{"format":"CD","value":"2160-9292"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1939-3539"}],"articleNumber":"106999","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":25,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":94},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=106999","abstract":"The directed divergence, which is a measure based on the discrimination information between two signal classes, is investigated.

The first important conclusion is that examples can be found in which BP gets stuck in local minima. A simple example in which BP can get stuck during gradient descent without having learned the entire training set is presented. This example guarantees the existence of a solution with null cost. Some conditions on the network architecture and the learning environment that ensure the convergence of the BP algorithm are proposed. It is proven in particular that the convergence holds if the classes are linearly separable.

The starting step is the extraction of a minimum separable switching configuration (MISSCO) containing all power switches but a minimum number of other components (resonant ones). By using the step-response analysis and average technique, and by perturbing and separating the DC and AC components in the resulting equations, the equivalent models of MISSCO are derived. They are introduced in the converter structure to replace the circuit initially extracted. Models of different quasi-resonant converters can be obtained by this general approach. The analysis takes into account the conduction losses of the switching devices and reactive elements, which improves considerably the model accuracy. Model-based computer simulation agrees with the experimental results.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Computer-aided modeling of quasi-resonant converters in the presence of parasitic losses by using the MISSCO concept","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","doi":"10.1109/41.107101","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel1/41/3266/00107101.pdf","startPage":"454","endPage":"461","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/41.107101","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3266","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=107101","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/107101/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1991","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1991","displayDocTitle":"Computer-aided modeling of quasi-resonant converters in the presence of parasitic losses by using the MISSCO concept","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"38","issue":"6","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Dec. 1991","accessionNumber":"4107864","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Computer-aided modeling of quasi-resonant converters in the presence of parasitic losses by using the MISSCO concept","sourcePdf":"00107101.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.032573S","chronDate":"Dec 1991","isNumber":"3266","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"29","articleId":"107101","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":107116,"authors":[{"name":"D.C.

The most straightforward method is simply to calibrate each resolver and resolver-to-digital (R/D) converter and then correct the R/D converter output in real time. Although this method corrects all errors, including those with an origin in the R/D converter, it is also the most time-consuming and labor-intensive. By appropriate signal processing, it is shown that quadrature error can be eliminated by simple algebraic manipulation of the resolver signals. Similarly, it is shown that all even harmonics in the resolver signals can be canceled if the resolver is constructed with complementary phases. It is shown that amplitude imbalance can be used to reduce the position error due to inductive harmonics.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3266","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/41.107116","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel1/41/3266/00107116.pdf","startPage":"501","endPage":"504","doi":"10.1109/41.107116","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Techniques for improving resolver-to-digital conversion accuracy","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1991","displayDocTitle":"Techniques for improving resolver-to-digital conversion accuracy","volume":"38","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 1991","accessionNumber":"4107872","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/107116/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1991","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Techniques for improving resolver-to-digital conversion accuracy","sourcePdf":"00107116.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.025891S","chronDate":"Dec 1991","isNumber":"3266","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"89","articleId":"107116","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2022-01-12"},{"_id":107142,"authors":[{"name":"K.R.

However, these vessel's dynamics vary considerably with operating condition, and are strongly coupled; they are expensive and difficult to derive, theoretically or through conventional testing, making the design of conventional autopilots difficult to achieve. Multi-input-multi-output self-tuning controllers offer a possible solution. Two such schemes are presented. The first is an implicit linear quadratic online, self-tuning controller, and the other uses a robust control law based on a first-order approximation of the open-loop dynamics and online recursive identification. The controllers' performance is evaluated by examining their behavior when controlling a comprehensive nonlinear simulation of an ROV and its navigation system. An interesting offshoot of this study is the application of recursive system identification techniques to the derivation of ROV models from data gathered from the trials; the potential advantages of this method are discussed.","doi":"10.1109/48.107142","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3268","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/48.107142","endPage":"151","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Oceanic Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Oceanic Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel1/48/3268/00107142.pdf","startPage":"144","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multivariable self-tuning autopilots for autonomous and remotely operated underwater vehicles","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  1990","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  1990","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/107142/","displayDocTitle":"Multivariable self-tuning autopilots for autonomous and remotely operated underwater vehicles","volume":"15","issue":"3","accessionNumber":"3724635","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"July 1990","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multivariable self-tuning autopilots for autonomous and remotely operated underwater vehicles","sourcePdf":"00107142.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.062248S","chronDate":"July  1990","isNumber":"3268","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"48","citationCount":"106","articleId":"107142","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":107143,"authors":[{"name":"R.

The model shows that the thruster behaves like a sluggish nonlinear filter, where the speed of response depends on the commanded thrust level. A quasi-linear analysis which utilizes describing functions shows that the dynamics of the thruster produce a strong bandwidth constraint and a limit cycle, which are both commonly seen in practice. Three forms of compensation are tested, utilizing a hybrid simulation combining an instrumented thruster with a real-time mathematical vehicle model. The first compensator, a linear lead network, is easy to implement and greatly improves performance over the uncompensated system, but does not perform uniformly over the entire operating range. The second compensator, which attempts to cancel the nonlinear effect of the thruster, is effective over the entire operating range but depends on an accurate thruster model. The final compensator, an adaptive sliding controller, is effective over the entire operating range and can compensate for uncertainties or the degradation of the thruster.","doi":"10.1109/48.107145","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/48.107145","startPage":"167","endPage":"178","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Oceanic Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel1/48/3268/00107145.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Oceanic Engineering","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3268","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The influence of thruster dynamics on underwater vehicle behavior and their incorporation into control system design","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  1990","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  1990","displayDocTitle":"The influence of thruster dynamics on underwater vehicle behavior and their incorporation into control system design","publicationDate":"July 1990","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","volume":"15","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"3724638","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/107145/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The influence of thruster dynamics on underwater vehicle behavior and their incorporation into control system design","sourcePdf":"00107145.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.02969S","chronDate":"July  1990","isNumber":"3268","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"48","citationCount":"246","articleId":"107145","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-29"},{"_id":107149,"authors":[{"name":"J.A.

Increases in computational capabilities have led to a number of complex but practical solutions aimed at increasing the reliability of acoustic data links. These solutions range from ocean-basin scale data telemetry to video-image transmission at a few hundred yards' distance. The opportunity to implement highly complex tasks in real time on modest hardware is a common factor. The data rates range from 1 to 500 kb/s and are much slower than satellite channels, while acceptable system complexity is higher than virtually any other channel with comparable data throughput. The basic performance bounds are the channel phase stability, available bandwidth, and the channel impulse response fluctuation rate. Phase stability is of particular concern for long-range telemetry, channel fluctuation characteristics drive equalizer, and synchronizer design; the bandwidth limitation is a direct constraint on data rate for a given signaling method.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/48.107149","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Oceanic Engineering","startPage":"205","endPage":"216","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Oceanic Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel1/48/3268/00107149.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/48.107149","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3268","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance limitations in underwater acoustic telemetry","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Underwater acoustics","Telemetry","Stability","Bandwidth","Fluctuations","Hardware","Satellites","Throughput","Equalizers","Signal design"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data communication systems","telemetering systems","underwater sound"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["underwater acoustic telemetry","digital acoustic telemetry","reliability","acoustic data links","ocean-basin scale data telemetry","video-image transmission","real time","channel phase stability","bandwidth","channel impulse response fluctuation rate","synchronizer design","1 to 500 kbit/s"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1990","displayDocTitle":"Performance limitations in underwater acoustic telemetry","volume":"15","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"3711819","publicationDate":"July 1990","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1990","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/107149/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance limitations in underwater acoustic telemetry","sourcePdf":"00107149.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.048322S","chronDate":"Jul 1990","isNumber":"3268","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"48","citationCount":"192","articleId":"107149","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":107154,"authors":[{"name":"Y.-T.

Due to the nonlinear nature of the problem, it is necessary to find the solution by grid searches. However, if measurements of the rates of frequency changes are available, the search is only in three dimensions instead of the normal five in source frequency, its x-y positions, and speeds. The validity of combining frequency and frequency-rate measurements is confirmed with simulation studies. The overall system includes a least-squares track-sort algorithm to differentiate the true track from the extraneous track, and a Kalman tracker for the prediction of future source positions, thereby reducing the grid search size.

The method is based on an electric equivalent and on the elimination of the voltage phase angle in the equations to be solved, which makes it possible to obtain the exact solution working only with voltage magnitudes. In this way, a simple and efficient method for the exact load flow solution for this type of network is obtained, allowing the modeling of voltage-dependent loads and the formulation of related problems like the radial load flow with voltage constraints.

The model consists of the middle ear, the mechanical motion of the cochlea, and the neural transduction of the inner hair cells. The traveling waves on the cochlear partition are represented by a cascade of digital filter sections, and the cochlear micromechanics are represented by a second filter that further sharpens the excitation to the inner hair cells. The neural firing rate is determined by the sum of the outputs of multiple fibers attached to each inner hair cell, with the fiber neurons having firing characteristics representative of low- and high-spontaneous-rate fibers. The signal processing cochlear model incorporates dynamic-range compression by adjusting the Q of each cochlear filter section and second filter in response to the second-filter velocity and the averaged neural firing rate.

A general expression is derived and then specialized to simpler configurations and related to results previously reported in the literature. The special case of a single stochastic source in a multipath environment is treated. The relative importance for source localization of the temporal (multipath) and spatial (array baseline) structures of the incoming wavefield is assessed. It is shown that for an array of K sensors the multipath contribution to the Fisher information matrix can be interpreted as the contribution of K independent arrays whose size depends on the number of spatially resolved replicas. The degradation due to unknown source spectra is analyzed. When the source spectrum is completely arbitrary, source location is not possible with a single sensor. If a parametric form of the source spectrum is available, the multipath structure can be used to locate the acoustic source.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/107410/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1991","volume":"39","issue":"12","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 1991","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4105266","displayDocTitle":"Cramer-Rao bound for location systems in multipath environments","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cramer-Rao bound for location systems in multipath environments","sourcePdf":"00107410.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038635S","chronDate":"Dec 1991","isNumber":"3276","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"45","articleId":"107410","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":107414,"authors":[{"name":"V.

The effects of spectral leakage, inherent in discrete Fourier transform operation when the modes present in the signal have a nonintegral number of wavelengths in the record, are included in the analysis. A single phase-coupled triad of modes can cause the bispectrum to have a nonzero mean value over the entire region of computation owing to leakage. The variance of bispectral estimates in the presence of leakage has contributions from individual modes and from triads of phase-coupled modes. Time-domain windowing reduces the leakage. The theoretical expressions for the mean and variance of bispectral estimates are derived in terms of a function dependent on an arbitrary symmetric time-domain window applied to the record. the number of data, and the statistics of the phase coupling among triads of modes.

Two procedures for the detection of laryngeal pathology were developed: (1) a spectral distortion measure using pitch synchronous and asynchronous methods with linear predictive coding (LPC) vectors and vector quantization (VQ), and (2) analysis of the EGG signal using time interval and amplitude difference measures. The VQ procedure was conjectured to offer the possibility of circumventing the need to estimate the glottal volume velocity waveform by inverse filtering techniques. The EGG procedure was to evaluate data that was 'nearly' a direct measure of vocal fold vibratory motion and thus was conjectured to offer the potential for providing an excellent assessment of laryngeal function. A threshold based procedure gave 75.9 and 69.0% probability of pathological detection using procedures (1) and (2), respectively, for 29 patients with pathological voices and 52 normal subjects.

These electrical events can be deduced from measured epicardial potentials; therefore, a noninvasive method of recovering epicardial potentials from body surface data is useful in clinical and experimental work. The ill-posed nature of this problem necessitates the use of regularization in the solution procedure. Inversion using Tihonov zero-order regularization, a quasi-static method, had been employed previously and was able to reconstruct, with relatively good accuracy, important events in cardiac excitation (maxima, minima, etc.). Taking advantage of the fact that the process of cardiac excitation is continuous in time, one can incorporate information from the time progression of excitation in the regularization procedure using the Twomey technique.

Extensive measurements of these characteristics as a function of device bias are reported. Direct measurements of the dispersive behavior between DC and 100 kHz and over a broad temperature range have been made on ion-implanted monolithic microwave IC (MMIC) devices. Conductance deep level transient spectroscopy (DLTS) and microwave S-parameter measurements have also been made to investigate this behavior. These measurements reveal that surface or channel-substrate interface traps in the material are most likely to be responsible for the observed behavior. A new equivalent-circuit model which accounts for many of the observed characteristics is developed. Unlike previously proposed equivalent circuits, the model does not rely on physically unrealistic circuit element values in order to obtain accurate performance predictions. The bias dependence of circuit element values is computed for one device.

The identification coding theorem of R. Ahlswede and G. Dueck (1989) for single-user discrete memoryless channels states that the identification capacity is equal to the Shannon capacity. A novel method to prove the converse to the identification coding theorem is shown to achieve the strong version of the result. Identification plus transmission (IT) coding, a variant of the original problem of identification via channels, is proposed in the context of a common problem in point-to-multipoint communication, where a central station wishes to transmit information reliably to one of N terminals, whose identity is not predetermined. The authors show that as long as log log N is smaller than the number of bits to be transmitted, IT codes allow information transmission at channel capacity.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/18.108245","startPage":"14","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel1/18/3287/00108245.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/18.108245","endPage":"25","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3287","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"New results in the theory of identification via channels","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/108245/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1992","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1992","displayDocTitle":"New results in the theory of identification via channels","volume":"38","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4123142","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Jan. 1992","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"New results in the theory of identification via channels","sourcePdf":"00108245.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.028039S","chronDate":"Jan 1992","isNumber":"3287","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"71","articleId":"108245","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":108246,"authors":[{"name":"T.-H.

To solve the problem, a linear system is applied to the observed data and adjusted so as to produce binary outputs. It is proved that the system coincides with the inverse of the unknown system (with scale and shift ambiguities), whether it is minimum or nonminimum phase. These results are derived for nonstationary independent binary inputs of infinite or finite length. Based on these results, an identification method is proposed for parametric linear systems. It is shown that under some mild conditions, a consistent estimator of the parameter can be obtained by minimizing a binariness criterion for the output data. Unlike many other blind identification and deconvolution methods, this criterion handles nonstationary signals and does not utilize any moment information of the inputs. Three numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/108246/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1992","volume":"38","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"4123143","publicationDate":"Jan. 1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Blind identification and deconvolution of linear systems driven by binary random sequences","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Blind identification and deconvolution of linear systems driven by binary random sequences","sourcePdf":"00108246.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.045103S","chronDate":"Jan 1992","isNumber":"3287","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"28","articleId":"108246","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":108249,"authors":[{"name":"J.

A method to derive tighter implicit upper bounds on the redundancy of both algorithms is also given, and it is shown that for the proposed variation this bound is smaller than for the original L-Z algorithm, or every value of N and K.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Upper bounds on the probability of sequences emitted by finite-state sources and on the redundancy of the Lempel-Ziv algorithm","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","doi":"10.1109/18.108250","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel1/18/3287/00108250.pdf","startPage":"66","endPage":"72","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/18.108250","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3287","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=108250","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/108250/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1992","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1992","displayDocTitle":"Upper bounds on the probability of sequences emitted by finite-state sources and on the redundancy of the Lempel-Ziv algorithm","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"38","issue":"1","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Jan. 1992","accessionNumber":"4123147","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Upper bounds on the probability of sequences emitted by finite-state sources and on the redundancy of the Lempel-Ziv algorithm","sourcePdf":"00108250.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.032267S","chronDate":"Jan 1992","isNumber":"3287","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"67","articleId":"108250","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-22"},{"_id":108252,"authors":[{"name":"F.

The definition of these properties is based on a linear-operator description of BTFRs. The first property, termed regularity, has important implications with respect to the recovery of signals from the BTFR outcome, the derivation of other bilinear signal representations from a BTFR, the BTFRs reaction to linear signal transformations, and the construction of bases of induced BTFR-domain spaces. The second property, called unitarity, is equivalent to validity of Moyal's formula (1949). Unitarity is thus necessary and sufficient for a closed-form solution of optimal signal synthesis and for a BTFR formulation or optimal detection/estimation methods. Unitarity also allows the systematic construction of BTFR product relations like the Wigner distribution's interference formula and the ambiguity function's self-transformation property. Unitarity permits the construction of induced orthogonal projection operators and guarantees the orthonormality of induced basis functions.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/108252/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1992","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1992","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"38","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4123149","displayDocTitle":"Regularity and unitarity of bilinear time-frequency signal representations","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Regularity and unitarity of bilinear time-frequency signal representations","sourcePdf":"00108252.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.051502S","chronDate":"Jan 1992","isNumber":"3287","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"43","articleId":"108252","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":108253,"authors":[{"name":"M.

It is shown that this process can be linked to the classical problem of cardinal spline interpolation by first convolving g(t) with a B-spline of order n. More specifically, the coefficients of the B-spline interpolation of order 2n+1 of the sampled filtered sequence are identical to the coefficients of the least-squares approximation of g(t) of order n. It is shown that this approximation can be obtained from a succession of three basic operations: prefiltering, sampling, and postfiltering, which confirms the parallel with the classical sampling/reconstruction procedure for bandlimited signals. The frequency responses of these filters are determined for three equivalent spline representations using alternative sets of shift-invariant basis functions of S/sup n/(R): the standard expansion in terms of B-spline coefficients, a representation in terms of sampled signal values, and a representation using orthogonal basis functions.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Polynomial spline signal approximations: filter design and asymptotic equivalence with Shannon's sampling theorem","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","doi":"10.1109/18.108253","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel1/18/3287/00108253.pdf","startPage":"95","endPage":"103","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/18.108253","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3287","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=108253","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/108253/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1992","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1992","displayDocTitle":"Polynomial spline signal approximations: filter design and asymptotic equivalence with Shannon's sampling theorem","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"38","issue":"1","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Jan. 1992","accessionNumber":"4123150","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Polynomial spline signal approximations: filter design and asymptotic equivalence with Shannon's sampling theorem","sourcePdf":"00108253.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.046544S","chronDate":"Jan 1992","isNumber":"3287","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"93","articleId":"108253","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":108255,"authors":[{"name":"J.

Both model-based methods and expert systems have been suggested to solve the problem, along with the pattern recognition approach. A number of possible neural network architectures for fault diagnosis are studied. The multilayer perceptron network with a hyperbolic tangent as the nonlinear element seems best suited for the task. As a test case, a realistic heat exchanger-continuous stirred tank reactor system is studied. The system has 14 noisy measurements and 10 faults. The proposed neural network was able to learn the faults in under 3000 training cycles and then to detect and classify the faults correctly. Principal component analysis is used to illustrate the fault diagnosis problem in question.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/21.108299","startPage":"815","endPage":"825","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/21.108299","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3288","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel1/21/3288/00108299.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neural networks in process fault diagnosis","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/108299/","displayDocTitle":"Neural networks in process fault diagnosis","volume":"21","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4088389","publicationDate":"July-Aug. 1991","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul/Aug 1991","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul/Aug 1991","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural networks in process fault diagnosis","sourcePdf":"00108299.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.088435S","chronDate":"Jul/Aug 1991","isNumber":"3288","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"21","citationCount":"208","articleId":"108299","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-10"},{"_id":108304,"authors":[{"name":"K.

The exact computation of the Jacobian matrix for Newton-iteration based HB simulation and the related conversion-matrix technique for fast mixer analysis are formulated in a general form. Convergence problems at high drive levels are solved by a parametric formulation of the device models coupled with an advanced norm-reducing iteration. A physics-based approximation is shown to allow the HB equations to be effectively decoupled in many practical cases, bringing large-sized jobs, such as pulsed-RF analysis, within the reach of ordinary workstations. The exact Jacobian is used in conjunction with an exact formula for the gradient of the objective function, to implement an efficient broadband nonlinear circuit optimization capability.

These models compare very well with analytical models in terms of their probability distribution of envelope and phase of the fading signal. For the land mobile satellite fading channel, results of level crossing rate and average fade duration are given. These results show that the computer models can provide a good coarse estimate of the time statistic of the faded signal. Also, for the land mobile satellite fading channel, the results show that a 3-pole Butterworth shaping filter should be used with the model.

The cochannel interference probability for sectorized cell layouts is compared with the lower bound of cochannel interference probability for omnidirectional antenna systems.

A detailed measurement-based propagation channel model, SIRCIM (simulation of indoor radio channel impulse response models), which generates over 1000 closely spaced baseband equivalent complex impulse responses for a mobile radio operating at 1.3 GHz and traveling over a 1-m path, is used. The small-scale channel model, the communication system models used in the analysis and the methods used to predict BER are described. The channel simulator and the systems models have been thoroughly tested, and results from average instantaneous BER simulations are shown. The BER performances of the modulation techniques are presented. It is found that BPSK offers between a 2.8-dB and 3.0-dB improvement over pi /4 DQPSK, although the latter offers a 3-dB increase in capacity for a given spectrum allocation.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/25.108384","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel1/25/3291/00108384.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/25.108384","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3291","startPage":"731","endPage":"740","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Simulation of bit error performance of FSK, BPSK, and pi /4 DQPSK in flat fading indoor radio channels using a measurement-based channel model","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=108384","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Simulation of bit error performance of FSK, BPSK, and pi /4 DQPSK in flat fading indoor radio channels using a measurement-based channel model","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/108384/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1991","isJournal":true,"volume":"40","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Nov. 1991","accessionNumber":"4114260","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Simulation of bit error performance of FSK, BPSK, and pi /4 DQPSK in flat fading indoor radio channels using a measurement-based channel model","sourcePdf":"00108384.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.054729S","chronDate":"Nov 1991","isNumber":"3291","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"14","articleId":"108384","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":108387,"authors":[{"name":"A.A.

This is done for modulation methods that are optimized with respect to minimum harmonic current RMS values. The results are compared to the results gained for simple sinusoidal modulation. Besides conduction losses, the switching losses of the electric valves are calculated. The main topic is the determination of those power loss components of a PWM converter system that can be (besides the harmonic losses) influenced by the modulation method selected. As the calculations show, these modulation methods allow a significant increase of the effective switching frequency. The optimal modulation as calculated leads to a reduction of the harmonic power loss in the upper modulation region. Furthermore, due to the frequency modulation the spectrum is spread out to a wider frequency band as compared to operation with constant pulse frequency.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Influence of the modulation method on the conduction and switching losses of a PWM converter system","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","doi":"10.1109/28.108456","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","pdfPath":"/iel1/28/3293/00108456.pdf","startPage":"1063","endPage":"1075","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/28.108456","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3293","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=108456","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/108456/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov/Dec 1991","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov/Dec 1991","displayDocTitle":"Influence of the modulation method on the conduction and switching losses of a PWM converter system","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"27","issue":"6","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Nov.-Dec. 1991","accessionNumber":"4108784","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Influence of the modulation method on the conduction and switching losses of a PWM converter system","sourcePdf":"00108456.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.046025S","chronDate":"Nov/Dec 1991","isNumber":"3293","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"28","citationCount":"362","articleId":"108456","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":108459,"authors":[{"name":"M.

This method requires the actual value of the rotor time constant as essential system information, based on how the magnitude and the position of the rotor flux are calculated. An online identification technique for the rotor time constant and for other machine parameters is described. The identification is based on an evaluation of the stator current trajectory, which is the dynamic response of the induction motor to the PWM-switching sequence. An analytical machine model is operated in parallel to the actual machine, having the stator voltages and the mechanical speed of the induction motor as input signals. The coincidence of the two stator current trajectories of the model and the machine serves as an error indicator for the parameter identification scheme, permitting repetitive updates of the model parameters.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov/Dec 1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/108462/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov/Dec 1991","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4108790","volume":"27","issue":"6","publicationDate":"Nov.-Dec. 1991","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Identification of the machine parameters in a vector-controlled induction motor drive","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Identification of the machine parameters in a vector-controlled induction motor drive","sourcePdf":"00108462.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041045S","chronDate":"Nov/Dec 1991","isNumber":"3293","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"28","citationCount":"112","articleId":"108462","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":108463,"authors":[{"name":"D.J.

The tomograph is able to acquire coincidences between any pair of detector rings and septa retraction increases the total system count rate by a factor of 7.8 (including scatter) and 4.7 (scatter subtracted) for a uniform, 20 cm diameter cylinder. The reconstruction algorithm is based on 3-D filtered backprojection, expressed in a form suitable for the multi-angle sinogram data. Sinograms which are not measured due to the truncated cylindrical geometry of the tomograph, but which are required for a spatially invariant response function, are obtained by forward projection. After filtering, the complete set of sinograms is backprojected into a 3-D volume of 128*128*31 voxels using a voxel-driven procedure. The algorithm has been validated with simulation, and tested with both phantom and clinical data from the 953B.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/42.108584","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","startPage":"505","endPage":"512","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","pdfPath":"/iel1/42/3298/00108584.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/42.108584","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3298","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fully three-dimensional reconstruction for a PET camera with retractable septa","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Positron emission tomography","Cameras","Scattering","Three dimensional displays","Detectors","Reconstruction algorithms","Geometry","Filtering","Testing","Imaging phantoms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomedical equipment","cameras","computerised tomography","radioisotope scanning and imaging"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["medical diagnostic imaging","fully 3D reconstruction","nuclear medicine","positron emission tomography","PET camera","retractable septa","reconstruction algorithm","Siemens/CTI 953B","spatially invariant response function","voxel-driven procedure","20 cm"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1991","displayDocTitle":"Fully three-dimensional reconstruction for a PET camera with retractable septa","volume":"10","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4103123","pubMedId":"18222855","publicationDate":"Dec. 1991","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/108584/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fully three-dimensional reconstruction for a PET camera with retractable septa","sourcePdf":"00108584.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.05885S","chronDate":"Dec.  1991","isNumber":"3298","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"42","citationCount":"146","articleId":"108584","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":108585,"authors":[{"name":"C.M.

An attempt is made to solve these two problems by parallelizing the EM algorithm on multiprocessor systems. An efficient data and task partitioning scheme, called partition-by-box, based on the message passing model is proposed. The partition-by-box scheme and its modified version have been implemented on a message passing system, Intel iPSC/2, and a shared memory system, BBN Butterfly GP1000. The implementation results show that, for the partition-by-box scheme, a message passing system of complete binary tree interconnection with fixed connectivity of three at each node can have similar performance to that with the hypercube topology, which has a connectivity of log/sub 2/ N for N PEs. It is shown that the EM algorithm can be efficiently parallelized using the (modified) partition-by-box scheme with the message passing model.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/108585/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1991","volume":"10","issue":"4","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 1991","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4103124","pubMedId":"18222856","displayDocTitle":"Parallelization of the EM algorithm for 3-D PET image reconstruction","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Parallelization of the EM algorithm for 3-D PET image reconstruction","sourcePdf":"00108585.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.0443S","chronDate":"Dec.  1991","isNumber":"3298","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"42","citationCount":"63","articleId":"108585","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":108591,"authors":[{"name":"J.-S.

ML-based reconstructions using a single pixel (SP) kernel with or without a sieve filter show no quantitative advantage over FBP except in the background where a reduction of noise is possible if the number of iterations is kept small (<50). ML-based reconstructions using a Gaussian kernel with a multipixel full-width-at-half-maximum (FWHM) and a large number of iterations [200] require a sieve filtering step to reduce the noise and contrast overshoot in the final images. These images have some small quantitative advantages over FBP depending on the structures being imaged. It is demonstrated that a feasibility stopping criterion controls the noise in a reconstructed image, but is insensitive to quantitation errors, and that the use of an appropriate overrelaxation parameter can accelerate the convergence of the ML-based method during the iterative process without quantitative instabilities.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image reconstruction","Kernel","Noise reduction","Computed tomography","Filters","Background noise","Filtering","Gaussian noise","Error correction","Acceleration"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computerised tomography","radioisotope scanning and imaging"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["emission computerised tomography","single pixel kernal","nuclear medicine","medical diagnostic imaging","quantitative instability","noise","quantitation","iterations","maximum likelihood-based reconstructions","reconstruction kernels","sieve filter","Gaussian kernel","multipixel full-width-at-half-maximum","sieve filtering step","contrast overshoot","overrelaxation parameter"]}],"doi":"10.1109/42.108591","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","pdfPath":"/iel1/42/3298/00108591.pdf","startPage":"563","endPage":"571","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3298","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/42.108591","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Practical tradeoffs between noise, quantitation, and number of iterations for maximum likelihood-based reconstructions","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=108591","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Practical tradeoffs between noise, quantitation, and number of iterations for maximum likelihood-based reconstructions","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/108591/","volume":"10","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Dec. 1991","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4103130","pubMedId":"18222862","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1991","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1991","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Practical tradeoffs between noise, quantitation, and number of iterations for maximum likelihood-based reconstructions","sourcePdf":"00108591.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043782S","chronDate":"Dec.  1991","isNumber":"3298","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"42","citationCount":"80","articleId":"108591","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-06"},{"_id":108597,"authors":[{"name":"E.

This approach differs from previous methods now in use, which search the circuit structure directly instead of constructing a formula from it. The new method is general and effective. It allows for the addition of heuristics used by structural search methods, and it has produced excellent results on popular test pattern generation benchmarks.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel1/43/3299/00108614.pdf","startPage":"4","endPage":"15","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","doi":"10.1109/43.108614","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/43.108614","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3299","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=108614","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Test pattern generation using Boolean satisfiability","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Test pattern generators","Circuit testing","Circuit faults","Automatic test pattern generation","Combinational circuits","Search methods","System testing","Performance evaluation","Logic testing","Data structures"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Boolean algebra","combinatorial circuits","logic testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Boolean satisfiability","single stuck-at faults","combinational circuits","test pattern generation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/108614/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1992","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1992","displayDocTitle":"Test pattern generation using Boolean satisfiability","volume":"11","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 1992","accessionNumber":"4107747","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Test pattern generation using Boolean satisfiability","sourcePdf":"00108614.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.053557S","chronDate":"Jan 1992","isNumber":"3299","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"450","articleId":"108614","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":108675,"authors":[{"name":"T.D.C.

The sensitivity of optical receivers using a MSM detector is analyzed, and a set of scaling rules is used to compare a MSM receiver's sensitivity with that of a similar receiver using a vertical p-i-n photodiode structure. Assuming identical preamplifier designs it is shown that the MSM-based receiver, except at very high bit rates, can in principle consistently outperform its p-i-n counterpart with as much as a 6-dB improvement in sensitivity.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel1/50/3303/00108707.pdf","startPage":"1635","endPage":"1638","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","doi":"10.1109/50.108707","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/50.108707","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3303","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=108707","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Integrated optical receivers using MSM detectors","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optical receivers","Detectors","Signal to noise ratio","PIN photodiodes","Capacitance","FETs","Leak detection","Circuit noise","Optical noise","High speed integrated circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["integrated optoelectronics","metal-semiconductor-metal structures","photodetectors","receivers","sensitivity"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["integrated receivers","MSM detectors","metal-semiconductor-metal","preamplifier electronics","horizontal surface","sensitivity","optical receivers","scaling rules"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/108707/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1991","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1991","displayDocTitle":"Integrated optical receivers using MSM detectors","volume":"9","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 1991","accessionNumber":"4103324","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Integrated optical receivers using MSM detectors","sourcePdf":"00108707.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.029765S","chronDate":"Dec 1991","isNumber":"3303","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"82","articleId":"108707","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-28"},{"_id":108708,"authors":[{"name":"M.J.

The function of the VSPD is a photodetector with functions of both a spatial light modulator and a photodetector. The VSPD with a metal-semiconductor-metal structure is shown to be suitable for the implementation of the analog synaptic weight with a bipolar value. A two-dimensional 8*8 array of VSPDs was fabricated on a GaAs substrate and integrated with a light-emitting-diode array with eight lines in hybrid form. This chip can simulate an eight-neuron system with 64 variable synaptic connections. The application to pattern classification was demonstrated by using the chip. The chip was used to classify 12 patterns into three categories by the backpropagation learning algorithm in a three-layered network.

It is based on digital computation of the three-phase current and voltage 60/50 Hz phasors at the line terminals. The method is independent of fault type and insensitive to source impedance variation or fault resistance. Furthermore, it considers the synchronization errors in sampling the current and voltage waveforms at the different line terminals. The method can be used online following the operation of digital relays or offline using data transferred to a central processor from digital transient recording apparatus. The authors start with a two-terminal line to explain the principles and then present the technique for a three-terminal line. The technique was first tested using data obtained from a steady-state fault analysis program to evaluate the convergence, observability, and uniqueness of the solution. The technique was then tested using EMPT-generated transient data. The test results show the high accuracy of the technique.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","pdfPath":"/iel3/61/3308/00108895.pdf","startPage":"98","endPage":"107","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","doi":"10.1109/61.108895","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/61.108895","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3308","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=108895","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new fault location technique for two- and three-terminal lines","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fault location","Impedance","Protective relaying","Equations","Voltage","Testing","Digital relays","Power system relaying","Radio frequency","IEEE members"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fault location","power system analysis computing","power transmission lines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["HV","power transmission lines","power system analysis computing","fault location","three-phase current","voltage","line terminals","synchronization errors","sampling","digital relays","digital transient recording","steady-state fault analysis program","60 Hz","50 Hz"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/108895/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1992","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1992","displayDocTitle":"A new fault location technique for two- and three-terminal lines","volume":"7","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 1992","accessionNumber":"4124601","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new fault location technique for two- and three-terminal lines","sourcePdf":"00108895.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.025166S","chronDate":"Jan 1992","isNumber":"3308","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"61","citationCount":"263","articleId":"108895","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-22"},{"_id":108896,"authors":[{"name":"T.S.

An analytic model to quantify the performance improvement by comparison with the basic time-stamp certification scheme is developed. Since the committed conflicting transaction may itself be back-shifted, the analytic model needs to estimate the distribution of the back-shift of the certification time-stamp in order to determine the probability of successfully back-shifting a transaction requesting commit. It is shown how this relatively complex protocol can be analyzed using a few simple approximations, validate the analysis through simulations, and the range of parameter values for which this approach is most beneficial is determined.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/69.109112","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/69.109112","startPage":"525","endPage":"537","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel3/69/3315/00109112.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3315","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modeling and analysis of a time-stamp history based certification protocol for concurrency control","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1991","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1991","displayDocTitle":"Modeling and analysis of a time-stamp history based certification protocol for concurrency control","publicationDate":"Dec. 1991","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","volume":"3","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4095054","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/109112/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modeling and analysis of a time-stamp history based certification protocol for concurrency control","sourcePdf":"00109112.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041244S","chronDate":"Dec 1991","isNumber":"3315","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"69","citationCount":"15","articleId":"109112","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-20"},{"_id":109129,"authors":[{"name":"K.W.

Considering filter reconstruction errors, quantization errors, signal statistics, and VLSI implementation constraints in the filter design, quadrature mirror filters (QMFs) are found to be most appropriate. As a result, two-dimensional QMFs with 10 coefficients for vertical and 14 coefficients for horizontal filtering are proposed. A compact VLSI implementation is possible by filter architectures utilizing the special features of QMFs. The timing constraints can be relaxed by the use of polyphase filter structures for decimation and interpolation. Utilization of the symmetry property of QMFs reduces the arithmetic hardware expense approximately by a factor of two. By taking advantage of the special VLSI architecture and optimization of the circuit technique, a one-chip realization for each, the analysis and synthesis filter bank of the luminance components can be achieved in a 1- mu m CMOS technology.

A three-dimensional spatiotemporal pyramid algorithms for high-quality compression of advanced television sequences is presented. The scheme utilizes a finite memory structure and is robust to channel errors, provides compatible subchannels, and can handle different scan formats, making it well suited for the broadcast environment. Additional features such as fast random access and reverse playback make it suitable for digital storage as well. Model-based processing is used both over space and time, where motion-based interpolation is used. Interpolation in an FIR (finite impulse response) scheme solves uncovered area problems, considerably improving the temporal prediction. The complexity is comparable to that of previous recursive schemes. Computer simulations indicate that high compression factors (about an order of magnitude) are easily achieved with no apparent loss of quality. The scheme also has a number of commonalities with the emerging MPEG standard.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/76.109149","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","pdfPath":"/iel4/76/3317/00109149.pdf","startPage":"86","endPage":"99","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/76.109149","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3317","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Interpolative multiresolution coding of advance television with compatible subchannels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=109149","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1991","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/109149/","displayDocTitle":"Interpolative multiresolution coding of advance television with compatible subchannels","volume":"1","issue":"1","publicationDate":"March 1991","accessionNumber":"3914762","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Interpolative multiresolution coding of advance television with compatible subchannels","sourcePdf":"00109149.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044499S","chronDate":"Mar 1991","isNumber":"3317","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"126","articleId":"109149","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":109154,"authors":[{"name":"S.-M.

A high-speed entropy coding system using these two techniques is considered for digital high definition television (HDTV) applications. Traditionally, VLC decoding is implemented through a tree-searching algorithm as the input bits are received serially. For HDTV applications, it is very difficult to implement a real-time VLC decoder of this kind due to the very high data rate required. A parallel structured VLC decoder which decodes each codeword in one clock cycle regardless of its length is introduced. The required clock rate of the decoder is thus lower, and parallel processing architectures become easy to adopt in the entropy coding system. The parallel entropy coder and decoder are designed for implementation in two experimental prototype chips which are designed to encode and decode more than 52 million samples/s. Some related system issues, such as the synchronization of variable-length codewords and error concealment, are also discussed.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","pdfPath":"/iel4/76/3317/00109154.pdf","startPage":"147","endPage":"155","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An entropy coding system for digital HDTV applications","doi":"10.1109/76.109154","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3317","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/76.109154","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=109154","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/109154/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1991","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1991","displayDocTitle":"An entropy coding system for digital HDTV applications","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"March 1991","accessionNumber":"3924296","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"1","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An entropy coding system for digital HDTV applications","sourcePdf":"109154.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038177S","chronDate":"March  1991","isNumber":"3317","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"150","articleId":"109154","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":109204,"authors":[{"name":"J.W.

It enhances throughput by using three function units to exploit parallelism, while executing RISC instructions in a data-driven manner to keep the function units busy. HPSm is data driven in the sense that instructions whose operands are not ready are not permitted to stall the machine by blocking subsequent ones. It uses branch prediction to exploit concurrency between blocks of code, and is capable of operating at a peak performance of 30 MIPS while running at only 10 MHz. It employs four on-chip smart memories to control the data-driven execution on the three function units, and to support branch prediction and exception handling. Simulations indicate that HPSm achieves significant speedup over a single-chip RISC microarchitecture implemented with the same fabrication technology and clock cycle. The HPSm chip is designed for a 1.6- mu m double-metal scalable CMOS process.

VANDA uses the functional compiler concept to integrate system and physical designs, thus allowing complex high-performance integrated circuit chips to be implemented easily. Three functional compilers have been designed and implemented for the design of a spread-spectrum transceiver: a pseudonoise (PN) generator compiler, a direct digital frequency synthesizer (DDFS) compiler, and a Costas loop compiler. Three test chips for a BPSK digital intermediate frequency (IF) spread-spectrum system generated by these compilers have been fabricated and tested. Details of each of the functional compilers and the test chips are described.

A new circuit block, the distributed neuron-synapse, has been used to implement a 1024 synapse reconfigurable network on a VLSI chip. In order to evaluate the performance of the VLSI chip, a complete test setup consisting of hardware for configuring the chip, programming the synaptic weights, presenting analog input vectors to the chip, and recording the outputs of the chip, has been built. Following the performance verification of each circuit block on the chip, various sample problems were solved. In each of the problems the synaptic weights were determined by training the neural network using a gradient-based learning algorithm which is incorporated in the experimental test setup. The results of this work indicate that reconfigurable neural networks built using distributed neuron synapses can be used to solve various problems efficiently.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/4.109558","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3328","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/4.109558","endPage":"81","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel5/4/3328/00109558.pdf","startPage":"67","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A reconfigurable VLSI neural network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1992","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/109558/","displayDocTitle":"A reconfigurable VLSI neural network","volume":"27","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"4123102","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Jan. 1992","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A reconfigurable VLSI neural network","sourcePdf":"00109558.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047953S","chronDate":"Jan 1992","isNumber":"3328","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"121","articleId":"109558","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":109559,"authors":[{"name":"J.

The system has several important features, such as time constants for time-domain computations, interchangeable chips allowing a modifiable gross architecture, and expandability to any arbitrary size. Such an approach allows the exploration of different network architectures for a wide range of applications, in particular dynamic real-world computations. Four different modules (neuron, synapse, time constant, and switch units) have been designed and fabricated in a 2- mu m CMOS technology. About 100 of these modules have been assembled in a fully functional prototype neural computer. An integrated software package for setting the network configuration and characteristics, and monitoring the neuron outputs has been developed as well. The performance of the individual modules as well as the overall system response for several applications was tested successfully.

The architecture exploits the inherent density and large bandwidth of on-chip RAM and can use either a large number of bit-serial processors or a reduced number of bit-parallel processors.

It is shown that for a large class of linear multivariable process models a properly designed certainty equivalence controller results in a tunable closed-loop parameterized system. The importance of this result to both the analysis and synthesis of parameter adaptive control systems is discussed. It is demonstrated by means of examples how the connection between certainty equivalence and tunability, together with the concept of tunability itself, can be used to markedly simplify the stability analysis of adaptive control systems. A new family of indirect parameterized controllers is introduced which has capabilities comparable to those of the well-known direct parameterized controllers which have served as basic building blocks for adaptive control systems of all types. The concept of implicit tuning is formalized and its potential importance to adaptive control is briefly discussed. It is explained how the idea of tunability can be used to analyze an implicitly tuned system.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/9.109635","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","pdfPath":"/iel4/9/3330/00109635.pdf","startPage":"15","endPage":"29","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/9.109635","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3330","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Towards a unified theory of parameter adaptive control.

It is shown that all second moment stability properties are equivalent and are sufficient for almost sure sample path stability, and a testable necessary and sufficient condition for second moment stability is derived. The Lyapunov exponent method for the study of almost sure sample stability is discussed, and a theorem which characterizes the Lyapunov exponents of jump linear systems is presented.

The controller is designed based on a Lyapunov method, which consists of a PD (proportional plus derivative) feedback part and a dynamic compensation part. It is shown that, without any prior knowledge of manipulator or payload parameters and possibly under deterioration of parameter variation with time or state-independent input disturbances, the tracking error is bound to converge to zero asymptotically. In particular, the algorithm does not require explicit system parameter estimation and therefore makes the controller structurally simple and computationally easy. Moreover, the controller is implemented in a decentralized manner, i.e. a subcontroller is independently and locally equipped at each joint servoloop. To illustrate the performance of the controller, a numerical simulation example is provided.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/9.109643","pdfPath":"/iel4/9/3330/00109643.pdf","startPage":"106","endPage":"110","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/9.109643","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3330","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust adaptive decentralized control of robot manipulators","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/109643/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1992","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1992","displayDocTitle":"Robust adaptive decentralized control of robot manipulators","volume":"37","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4114173","publicationDate":"Jan. 1992","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust adaptive decentralized control of robot manipulators","sourcePdf":"00109643.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.025601S","chronDate":"Jan 1992","isNumber":"3330","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9","citationCount":"114","articleId":"109643","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-09"},{"_id":109644,"authors":[{"name":"G.

Future directions for mobile satellite communications systems are discussed. One approach emerging is the use of large satellites, with large antennas. operating at much higher carrier frequencies. A second approach is to use low-earth orbit (LEO) satellites. in order to reduce the path loss. The LEO approach also results in much smaller propagation delays than those experienced with geostationary satellites.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/35.109661","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel1/35/3331/00109661.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/35.109661","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3331","startPage":"24","endPage":"30","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Mobile satellite communications systems: Toward global personal communications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=109661","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Mobile satellite communications systems: Toward global personal communications","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/109661/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1991","isJournal":true,"volume":"29","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 1991","accessionNumber":"4093269","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mobile satellite communications systems: Toward global personal communications","sourcePdf":"00109661.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.04208S","chronDate":"Nov.  1991","isNumber":"3331","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"35","citationCount":"44","articleId":"109661","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":109664,"authors":[{"name":"S.

It assumes a void driven in the liquid from the cathode by electrical force on the void's charged liquid boundary (LDR wall). The effects of varying certain parameters on the simulation results are discussed. Simulation results are compared with earlier experimental values of LDR size, pulse charges, and pulse duration as functions of time and pressure. The results suggest that the LDR is driven by electrical pressure which is initially much larger than typical ambient pressures but which drops during the LDR expansion to below ambient pressure, resulting in the demise of the LDR. Current pulses are then produced as a result of the expansion (rather than being its cause), and they serve as externally detectable telemetry signals characterizing the LDR state without invading it. The pulses result when the LDR grows and its trapped charge spreads over larger wall area, changing the LDR wall potential.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ELINSL.1990.109705","startPage":"47","endPage":"51","publicationTitle":"IEEE International Symposium on Electrical Insulation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ELINSL.1990.109705","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3333","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE International Symposium on Electrical Insulation","pdfPath":"/iel2/104/3333/00109705.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Evaluation of a model for prebreakdown at the cathode in a DC-stressed liquid","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/109705/","displayDocTitle":"Evaluation of a model for prebreakdown at the cathode in a DC-stressed liquid","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"3897505","publicationDate":"1990","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"3-6 June 1990","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 Jun 1990","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Evaluation of a model for prebreakdown at the cathode in a DC-stressed liquid","confLoc":"Toronto, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"00109705.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039367S","chronDate":"3-6 Jun 1990","isNumber":"3333","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"104","citationCount":"4","articleId":"109705","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":109724,"authors":[{"name":"M.

It is concluded that thermoelastic internal friction is a measurable phenomenon in micromachined flexures and should be considered when designing, testing, and evaluating miniature resonators for solid-state sensors.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The effect of thermoelastic internal friction on the Q of micromachined silicon resonators","publicationTitle":"IEEE 4th Technical Digest on Solid-State Sensor and Actuator Workshop","doi":"10.1109/SOLSEN.1990.109810","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE 4th Technical Digest on Solid-State Sensor and Actuator Workshop","pdfPath":"/iel2/107/3334/00109810.pdf","startPage":"13","endPage":"16","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SOLSEN.1990.109810","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3334","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=109810","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/109810/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 June 1990","displayDocTitle":"The effect of thermoelastic internal friction on the Q of micromachined silicon resonators","conferenceDate":"4-7 June 1990","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1990","accessionNumber":"3897819","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The effect of thermoelastic internal friction on the Q of micromachined silicon resonators","confLoc":"Hilton Head, SC, USA","sourcePdf":"00109810.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.083447S","chronDate":"4-7 June 1990","isNumber":"3334","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"107","citationCount":"96","articleId":"109810","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":109817,"authors":[{"name":"J.B.

A technique for mitigation of compressibility effects through film pressurization is suggested. Ideal damping results if both the squeeze number and the relative displacement are kept much less than 1.0.

The sensor assembly consists of three silicon chips, bonded together at the wafer level. The micromachined sensor is operated in a vacuum to eliminate nonlinear viscous damping and to provide a high-Q second-order mechanical resonant circuit.
