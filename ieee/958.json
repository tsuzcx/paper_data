As a result, a more durable network must be created to enable huge access to networks and intelligent communication systems beyond 5G and 6G. In this paper, a cross-tier interference is addressed in the two-tier 5G architecture. A massive MIMO is used at the Base stations (BSs) which served micro user equipment (MUEs)., and small cells (SBSs) are equipped with lesser antennas are served to small cell user equipment (SUEs). A synchronized co-channel TDD is used to communicate over the available bandwidth. The advantage of the synchronized co-channel TDD mode is utilized to estimate the channel. A correlation matrix of a received signal is estimated from the uplink (UL) pilot signal. Hence we modified the correlation matrix and therefore even though the precise knowledge of the interfering channel is not available the channel can be estimated. A modified heuristic optimal resource allocation (HORA) algorithm is used for scheduling. The simulation demonstrates considerable throughput improvement at the user end in two-tier cellular architecture and robust conditions.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Correlation","5G mobile communication","Channel estimation","Massive MIMO","Interference","Computer architecture","Throughput"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["5G","Minimum Mean Square Error (MMSE)","cross-tier interference","small-cell base stations (SBSs)","Cochannel TDD"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICCCNT51525.2021.9580019","publicationTitle":"2021 12th International Conference on Computing Communication and Networking Technologies (ICCCNT)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 12th International Conference on Computing Communication and Networking Technologies (ICCCNT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9579467/9579470/09580019.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9579470","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCCNT51525.2021.9580019","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-user Massive MIMO for Cross-Tiers Interference Mitigation in Heterogeneous 5G Next Generation Network","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9580019","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Multi-user Massive MIMO for Cross-Tiers Interference Mitigation in Heterogeneous 5G Next Generation Network","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9580019/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"6 July 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9580019/","conferenceDate":"6-8 July 2021","dateOfInsertion":"13 November 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 July 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-user Massive MIMO for Cross-Tiers Interference Mitigation in Heterogeneous 5G Next Generation Network","confLoc":"Kharagpur, India","sourcePdf":"977.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06951S","chronDate":"6-8 July 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9579467","isNumber":"9579470","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9579467","xplore-issue":"9579470","articleId":"9580019","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-26"},{"_id":9580116,"authors":[{"name":"Md.

Book reading culture dates back to almost a couple of thousands of years. After ancient civilizations learned to write, they stored information in tablets or walls or stones are said to be the predecessors of books. The newest form of books is called e-books, digitalization or digital printing of paper-based books. In Bangladesh, even a few years back, people had to go to the library in person to collect books but now online book stores are getting popular. With all its perks being easy, online book store comes with some penalty i.e. reader don't know about the books or the service of the book store itself. To avoid such, book readers tend to rely on reviews and ratings. Our goal is to analyze Bangla language reviews and give proper feedback about books and the online store so the book readers can buy desired books to read and get better services from online book stores. 6281 raw data are collected to train the machine. In this study, the Machine Learning and Deep Learning methods are used for the binary (negative, positive) analysis of sentiments. Natural Language Processing (NLP) is used for text preprocessing. Some of the popular algorithms like Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree, KNN, Random Forest, Logistic Regression and Long Short-Term Memory(LSTM) are used to classify the sentiments. Our Highest accuracy is 97.49%, achieved by LSTM.","doi":"10.1109/ICCCNT51525.2021.9580116","pdfPath":"/iel7/9579467/9579470/09580116.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 12th International Conference on Computing Communication and Networking Technologies (ICCCNT)","publicationTitle":"2021 12th International Conference on Computing Communication and Networking Technologies (ICCCNT)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCCNT51525.2021.9580116","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9579470","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Classification of Book Review Sentiment in Bangla Language Using NLP, Machine Learning and LSTM","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9580116/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 July 2021","displayDocTitle":"Classification of Book Review Sentiment in Bangla Language Using NLP, Machine Learning and LSTM","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"13 November 2021","publicationDate":"6 July 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9580116/","conferenceDate":"6-8 July 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Classification of Book Review Sentiment in Bangla Language Using NLP, Machine Learning and LSTM","confLoc":"Kharagpur, India","sourcePdf":"827.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044231S","chronDate":"6-8 July 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9579467","isNumber":"9579470","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9579467","xplore-issue":"9579470","articleId":"9580116","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":9580117,"authors":[{"name":"Md Sohel Miah","affiliation":["Daffodil International University, Dhaka, Bangladesh"],"firstName":"Md Sohel","lastName":"Miah","id":"37089015559"},{"name":"Tayeeba Tasnuva","affiliation":["Daffodil International University, Dhaka, Bangladesh"],"firstName":"Tayeeba","lastName":"Tasnuva","id":"37089012068"},{"name":"Mirajul Islam","affiliation":["Daffodil International University, Dhaka, Bangladesh"],"firstName":"Mirajul","lastName":"Islam","id":"37089014282"},{"name":"Mumenunnessa Keya","affiliation":["Daffodil International University, Dhaka, Bangladesh"],"firstName":"Mumenunnessa","lastName":"Keya","id":"37088532859"},{"name":"Md.

This hierarchy helps vendors in different supermarkets to identify the species of fruit and also influences the pricing accordingly. The classification approach makes it much easier to determine if the fruit is good or poor. It is important to be able to quickly detect fruits when exporting fruits. Our economic situation will deteriorate if we are unable to export fresh fruits. So, in this case, a fruit classification system can be useful in a variety of areas, including autonomous agricultural robots and the production of smartphone apps for identifying unique fruit species on the market. In this study, we have taken a total of 5658 fruits images which are based on 10 classes. In the agriculture sector, detecting rotten fruits has been crucial. Humans are typically used to classify fresh and rotting fruits, which is ineffective for fruit growers. Humans get exhausted after doing the same role many times, but Machines however do not. As a result, the initiative recommends a strategy for reducing human effort and lowering costs. By finding defects in agricultural fruits, the expense and time for processing may be minimized. In our proposed classification system, we have worked on five CNN models.

To communicate with other deaf or healthy people, they use sign language. Deaf and mute people of Bangladesh and India use Bangla sign language to fulfill their communication needs. But, the learning process of sign language is time consuming and arduous. Therefore, as the artificial intelligence technology advances, automatic recognition of Bangla sign language is gaining more attention from researchers. In this paper, the proposed research aims to develop an approach to automate the identification of Bangla Sign Digits comparing the efficacy of handcrafted and deep neural network features. The handcrafted feature extractors like Histogram of Oriented Gradient (HOG), Scale invariant feature transform (SIFT), and pre-trained deep neural network feature extractors such as InceptionV3, Xception, and DenseNet-121 was used on publicly available Ishara-Lipi dataset to extract features. Moreover, to recognize sign digits, we used three fine-tuned classification algorithms namely K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM) that were fed by extracted features. Experimental result shows that the deep neural network features outperformed the handcrafted features based approach. DenseNet-121 combined with SVM based approach achieved highest test accuracy of 99.53% on Ishara-Lipi dataset.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 July 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9580138/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9580138/","publicationDate":"6 July 2021","dateOfInsertion":"13 November 2021","conferenceDate":"6-8 July 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Comparison of Handcrafted and Deep Neural Network Feature Extraction for Recognizing Bangla Sign Digits Exploiting Machine Learning Classifiers","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparison of Handcrafted and Deep Neural Network Feature Extraction for Recognizing Bangla Sign Digits Exploiting Machine Learning Classifiers","confLoc":"Kharagpur, India","sourcePdf":"849.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048063S","chronDate":"6-8 July 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9579467","isNumber":"9579470","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9579467","xplore-issue":"9579470","articleId":"9580138","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-07"},{"_id":9580173,"authors":[{"name":"Mohammad Mushtaq Ahmed","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering,NIT Warangal,India"],"firstName":"Mohammad Mushtaq","lastName":"Ahmed","id":"37089017431"},{"name":"Bura Santhi Kiran","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering,NIT Warangal,India"],"firstName":"Bura Santhi","lastName":"Kiran","id":"37089017576"},{"name":"Pododdi Harshavardhan Sai","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering,NIT Warangal,India"],"firstName":"Pododdi Harshavardhan","lastName":"Sai","id":"37089018276"},{"name":"Manjubala Bisi","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering,NIT Warangal,India"],"firstName":"Manjubala","lastName":"Bisi","id":"37085592384"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-8595-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-8596-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9580173","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":6},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9580173","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Deep learning","Costs","Software metrics","Learning automata","Software algorithms","Predictive models","Software systems"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Deep neural network","Software defect prediction","Learning automata","Sampling methods"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9579470","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 12th International Conference on Computing Communication and Networking Technologies (ICCCNT)","publicationTitle":"2021 12th International Conference on Computing Communication and Networking Technologies (ICCCNT)","doi":"10.1109/ICCCNT51525.2021.9580173","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Software Fault-Prone Module Classification Using Learning Automata based Deep Neural Network Model","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","pdfPath":"/iel7/9579467/9579470/09580173.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCCNT51525.2021.9580173","abstract":"The software systems usually include some defects that will show adverse effects on the use of the application.

The deep learning model is trained using learning automata. We have validated our proposed approach using publicly available data set taken from public repository.

assist the joint processing coordinated multipoint transmission from multiple base stations (BSs) to multiple cell-edge users. Considering the imperfect cascade channel state information, we aim to minimize the total transmit power by jointly optimizing the transmit beamforming at the BSs and the phase shifts at the RIS, while satisfying the BSs' individual power constraints and users' worst case target rate constraint. To solve this nonconvex problem of complex coupling of variables, we decouple it into two sub-problems and introduce an alternating optimization framework. The transmit beamforming sub-problem can be recast in a convex form by using the S-Procedure and semidefinite relaxation techniques, when fixing the phase shifts. Subsequently, we transform the phase shifts sub-problem into an object-specific optimization problem, and then an iterative algorithm based on bisection method is proposed to obtain the solution. Simulation results show that the proposed robust beamforming design can converge rapidly and outperforms the reference scheme.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCC52777.2021.9580215","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9580191","startPage":"392","endPage":"397","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE/CIC International Conference on Communications in China (ICCC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9579484/9580191/09580215.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust Beamforming for Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface Aided Coordinated Multipoint Transmission","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9580215/","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 July 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9580215/","displayDocTitle":"Robust Beamforming for Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface Aided Coordinated Multipoint Transmission","conferenceDate":"28-30 July 2021","publicationDate":"28 July 2021","dateOfInsertion":"13 November 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust Beamforming for Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface Aided Coordinated Multipoint Transmission","confLoc":"Xiamen, China","sourcePdf":"p392-yang.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.15674S","chronDate":"28-30 July 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9579484","isNumber":"9580191","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9579484","xplore-issue":"9580191","articleId":"9580215","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-11"},{"_id":9580224,"authors":[{"name":"Li Qiao","affiliation":["School of Information and Electronics, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China","Advanced Research Institute of Multidisciplinary Science, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Li","lastName":"Qiao","id":"37088428756"},{"name":"Zhen Gao","affiliation":["School of Information and Electronics, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China","Advanced Research Institute of Multidisciplinary Science, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zhen","lastName":"Gao","id":"37073332000"},{"name":"Chen He","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Technology, Northwest University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Chen","lastName":"He","id":"37576098300"},{"name":"Zhenyu Xiao","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zhenyu","lastName":"Xiao","id":"37085397807"},{"name":"Dezhi Zheng","affiliation":["Advanced Research Institute of Multidisciplinary Science, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Dezhi","lastName":"Zheng","id":"37089022541"},{"name":"Jun Zhang","affiliation":["School of Information and Electronics, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China","Advanced Research Institute of Multidisciplinary Science, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jun","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37293680000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4385-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4386-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2377-8644"}],"articleNumber":"9580224","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":24},"abstract":"The grant-free non-coherent index-modulation (NC-IM) has been recently emerging as an efficient embedded information transmission scheme for massive machine-type communications without channel state information, especially for cost-efficient Internet-of- Things (IoT) devices with small data packets. In this paper, we combine the grant-free NC-IM with OFDM for overcoming frequency-selective channel fading. Specifically, each device is allocated with a unique signature sequence codebook and active device transmits one of its signature sequences in each subcarrier. Information is embedded in the index of the transmitted signature sequence. By exploiting the structured sparsity of the equivalent channel matrix in the spatial domain and the common device activity in the subcarrier domain, we propose an efficient space-frequency joint activity and blind information detection algorithm with significantly improved device activity and embedded information detection performance. Simulation results verify the superiority of the proposed algorithm over state-of-the-art algorithms.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Performance evaluation","Time-frequency analysis","Frequency modulation","OFDM","Simulation","Signal processing algorithms","Sensors"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Internet-of-Things","massive machine-type communications","massive access","non-coherent index modulation","compressive sensing"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICCC52777.2021.9580224","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE/CIC International Conference on Communications in China (ICCC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE/CIC International Conference on Communications in China (ICCC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9579484/9580191/09580224.pdf","startPage":"694","endPage":"699","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9580191","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCC52777.2021.9580224","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Non-Coherent Grant-Free Massive IoT Access for mMTC: An Index Modulation Perspective","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9580224","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Non-Coherent Grant-Free Massive IoT Access for mMTC: An Index Modulation Perspective","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9580224/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"28 July 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9580224/","conferenceDate":"28-30 July 2021","dateOfInsertion":"13 November 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 July 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Non-Coherent Grant-Free Massive IoT Access for mMTC: An Index Modulation Perspective","confLoc":"Xiamen, China","sourcePdf":"p694-qiao.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061364S","chronDate":"28-30 July 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9579484","isNumber":"9580191","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9579484","xplore-issue":"9580191","articleId":"9580224","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-26"},{"_id":9580227,"authors":[{"name":"Chengpeng Tu","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Wireless-Optical Communications, Chinese Academy of Sciences, School of Information Science and Technology, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, Anhui, China"],"firstName":"Chengpeng","lastName":"Tu","id":"37087119206"},{"name":"Weijie Liu","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Wireless-Optical Communications, Chinese Academy of Sciences, School of Information Science and Technology, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, Anhui, China"],"firstName":"Weijie","lastName":"Liu","id":"37086184466"},{"name":"Wenli Jiang","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Wireless-Optical Communications, Chinese Academy of Sciences, School of Information Science and Technology, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, Anhui, China"],"firstName":"Wenli","lastName":"Jiang","id":"37089025281"},{"name":"Zhengyuan Xu","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Wireless-Optical Communications, Chinese Academy of Sciences, School of Information Science and Technology, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, Anhui, China"],"firstName":"Zhengyuan","lastName":"Xu","id":"37085336087"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4385-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4386-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2377-8644"}],"articleNumber":"9580227","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":22},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9580227","abstract":"We use a single-mode pigtailed 520 nm laser diode (LD) and an avalanche photo detector (APD) to construct an underwater optical wireless communication (UOWC) system.

In this paper, a new non-orthogonal multiple-access (NOMA) transmission protocol that incorporates orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) modulation is proposed to solve these problems. Furthermore, we propose a two-stages joint active user detection and channel estimation scheme based on the training sequences aided OTFS data frame structure. Specifically, in the first stage, with the aid of training sequences, we perform active user detection and coarse channel estimation by recovering the sparse sampled channel vectors. And then, we develop a parametric approach to facilitate more accurate result of channel estimation with the previously recovered sampled channel vectors according to the inherent characteristics of TSL channel.

In this paper, we propose an improved time-frequency (TF) domain linear receiver for orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) based OTFS systems. The proposed receiver uses the minimum mean square error (MMSE) equalizer in the TF domain considering inter-carrier interference, and implements channel normalization in the DD domain. As simulation results show, the proposed receiver can achieve a lower BER for the uncoded system, and also a BLER for the coded OTFS system using low density parity check codes (LDPC) in 5G systems. The complexity of the proposed receiver is almost the same as that of the conventional linear receiver in the TF domain, which is much lower than those of the DD domain receivers.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9580245/","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 July 2021","conferenceDate":"28-30 July 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"28 July 2021","dateOfInsertion":"13 November 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9580245/","displayDocTitle":"Improved Time-Frequency Domain Linear Receiver for OFDM-Based OTFS","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)","grantNumber":"61931005"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improved Time-Frequency Domain Linear Receiver for OFDM-Based OTFS","confLoc":"Xiamen, China","sourcePdf":"p410-xu.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.401818S","chronDate":"28-30 July 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9579484","isNumber":"9580191","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9579484","xplore-issue":"9580191","articleId":"9580245","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-10"},{"_id":9580275,"authors":[{"name":"Shuiqin Wang","affiliation":["College of Electronic Science National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Shuiqin","lastName":"Wang","id":"37089024680"},{"name":"Ke Lai","affiliation":["College of Electronic Science National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Ke","lastName":"Lai","id":"37086173982"},{"name":"Jing Lei","affiliation":["College of Electronic Science National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Jing","lastName":"Lei","id":"37652895400"},{"name":"Lei Wen","affiliation":["College of Electronic Science National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Lei","lastName":"Wen","id":"37085360517"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4385-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4386-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2377-8644"}],"articleNumber":"9580275","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":48},"abstract":"Sparse Code Multiple Access (SCMA) is a nonorthogonal multiple access (NOMA) scheme with high spectrum efficiency and reliability.

In this paper, a single carrier SCMA system (SC-SCMA) with frequency domain equalization (FDE) is firstly proposed to reduce PAPR. Since the performance of SC-SCMA is largely affected by the deep fading point in time domain, to tackle this problem, a hybrid carrier SCMA (HC-SCMA) system based on weighted-type fractional Fourier transform (WFRFT) is further proposed.

The proposed channel model extends the quasi deterministic radio channel generator (QuaDRiGa) model and takes unique property of LEO satellite communication, such as Faraday rotation effect into account. The paper presents a single-bounce channel model, taking the spatial consistency of parameters into account and supporting simultaneous movements of the transmitter (Tx) and receiver (Rx). Finally, simulation experiments are conducted under different environments, center frequencies, and heights of satellites.

However, traditional MI communications are mainly based on single or multiple carriers with resonant frequencies, which makes the achievable rate much less than the capacity of frequency-selective MI channel. To approach the capacity of frequency-selective MI channel, we formulate the orthogonal-frequency-division-multiplexing (OFDM) based MI communication framework, where resonant frequency and nonresonant frequencies are comprehensively utilized. Also, multiple transmit coils are equipped for the aboveground user to enhance the receive power of the underground user with single coil. We propose the optimal current control scheme in closed-form, which aims at maximizing the achievable rate under the constraint of transmit power. Based on the proposed current control scheme, the approximate expression for the capacity of frequency-selective multiple-input-single-output MI (MISO-MI) channel is given. Numerical results verify our theoretical analyses and show that MISO-OFDM based MI communication system can significantly increase the achievable rate. It is also shown that the proposed current control scheme can achieve larger achievable rate as compared with other schemes.","doi":"10.1109/ICCC52777.2021.9580360","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE/CIC International Conference on Communications in China (ICCC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9579484/9580191/09580360.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9580191","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCC52777.2021.9580360","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE/CIC International Conference on Communications in China (ICCC)","startPage":"133","endPage":"138","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal Current Control for MISO-OFDM Based Through-the-Earth Communications with Magnetic Induction","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9580360","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 July 2021","displayDocTitle":"Optimal Current Control for MISO-OFDM Based Through-the-Earth Communications with Magnetic Induction","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9580360/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9580360/","publicationDate":"28 July 2021","dateOfInsertion":"13 November 2021","conferenceDate":"28-30 July 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal Current Control for MISO-OFDM Based Through-the-Earth Communications with Magnetic Induction","confLoc":"Xiamen, China","sourcePdf":"p133-wang.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051331S","chronDate":"28-30 July 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9579484","isNumber":"9580191","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9579484","xplore-issue":"9580191","articleId":"9580360","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-16"},{"_id":9580368,"authors":[{"name":"Xuanheng Li","affiliation":["School of Information and Communication Engineering, Dalian University of Technology, Dalian, China"],"firstName":"Xuanheng","lastName":"Li","id":"37085636584"},{"name":"Jiahong Liu","affiliation":["School of Information and Communication Engineering, Dalian University of Technology, Dalian, China"],"firstName":"Jiahong","lastName":"Liu","id":"37089025632"},{"name":"Nan Zhao","affiliation":["School of Information and Communication Engineering, Dalian University of Technology, Dalian, China"],"firstName":"Nan","lastName":"Zhao","id":"38516823600"},{"name":"Nianmin Yao","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Technology, Dalian University of Technology, Dalian, China"],"firstName":"Nianmin","lastName":"Yao","id":"37088452788"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4385-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4386-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2377-8644"}],"articleNumber":"9580368","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":32},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Schedules","Uncertainty","Simulation","Unmanned aerial vehicles","Probability distribution","Trajectory","Delays"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["edge caching","UAV assisted network","demand uncertainty","data-driven","distributionally robust optimization"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9580368","doi":"10.1109/ICCC52777.2021.9580368","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCC52777.2021.9580368","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9580191","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE/CIC International Conference on Communications in China (ICCC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE/CIC International Conference on Communications in China (ICCC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9579484/9580191/09580368.pdf","startPage":"752","endPage":"757","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Proactive Joint Strategy on Trajectory and Caching for UAV-Assisted Networks: A Data-Driven Distributionally Robust Approach","abstract":"With the soaring growth of data traffic, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) based edge caching has been regarded as a promising solution to alleviate network congestion and enable users to obtain their desired contents with reduced delay. For the UAV-based edge caching, how to jointly plan the trajectory and caching strategy is the key, which determines how much benefit can achieve accordingly. Such a joint strategy design highly depends on the content demands in the network. However, the content demands are usually heterogeneous both temporally and spatially, and hardly known in advance. Such demand uncertainty makes the joint strategy design extremely challenging. In this paper, aiming at maximizing the reduced delay brought by the UAV-based edge caching, we propose a proactive joint trajectory and caching strategy under uncertain content demands. We formulate it into a risk-averse stochastic optimization problem to guarantee the maximal benefit with a high probability. Furthermore, considering the fact that the precise distributional information might be unavailable in practice, we focus on the worst case and develop a data-driven distributionally robust solution, making the strategy trustworthy. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed strategy.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9580368/","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 July 2021","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"28-30 July 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9580368/","dateOfInsertion":"13 November 2021","publicationDate":"28 July 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A Proactive Joint Strategy on Trajectory and Caching for UAV-Assisted Networks: A Data-Driven Distributionally Robust Approach","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61801080"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002858","fundingName":"China Postdoctoral Science Foundation","grantNumber":"2020M680038"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100012226","fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"DUT20RC(4)007"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Proactive Joint Strategy on Trajectory and Caching for UAV-Assisted Networks: A Data-Driven Distributionally Robust Approach","confLoc":"Xiamen, China","sourcePdf":"p752-li.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.086662S","chronDate":"28-30 July 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9579484","isNumber":"9580191","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9579484","xplore-issue":"9580191","articleId":"9580368","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-26"},{"_id":9580370,"authors":[{"name":"Zhe Xing","affiliation":["College of Electronics and Information Engineering, Tongji University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Zhe","lastName":"Xing"},{"name":"Rui Wang","affiliation":["College of Electronics and Information Engineering, Tongji University, Shanghai, China","Shanghai Institute of Intelligent Science and Technology, Tongji University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Rui","lastName":"Wang"},{"name":"Xiaojun Yuan","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory of Science and Technology on Communications, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Xiaojun","lastName":"Yuan"},{"name":"Jun Wu","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Technology, Fudan University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Jun","lastName":"Wu"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4385-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4386-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2377-8644"}],"articleNumber":"9580370","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Uncertainty","Array signal processing","Simulation","Millimeter wave technology","Receivers","Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces","Mobile communication"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)","worst-case robust beamforming","millimeter-wave (mmWave)","error bound"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9580370","doi":"10.1109/ICCC52777.2021.9580370","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE/CIC International Conference on Communications in China (ICCC)","abstract":"The reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) is promising in fulfilling the requirement of green communication in the fifth- and sixth-generation (5G/6G) mobile communication networks.

Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms the conventional non-robust approach in terms of the worst-case signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at the receiver, and becomes more advantageous in the presence of higher level of the user location uncertainty.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCC52777.2021.9580370","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9580191","startPage":"201","endPage":"206","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE/CIC International Conference on Communications in China (ICCC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9579484/9580191/09580370.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Location-aware Beamforming Design for Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface Aided Communication System","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9580370/","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 July 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9580370/","displayDocTitle":"Location-aware Beamforming Design for Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface Aided Communication System","conferenceDate":"28-30 July 2021","publicationDate":"28 July 2021","dateOfInsertion":"13 November 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Location-aware Beamforming Design for Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface Aided Communication System","confLoc":"Xiamen, China","sourcePdf":"p201-xing.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.092774S","chronDate":"28-30 July 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9579484","isNumber":"9580191","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9579484","xplore-issue":"9580191","articleId":"9580370","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-11"},{"_id":9580373,"authors":[{"name":"Zhinan Sun","affiliation":["School of Communication and Information Engineering, Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Chongqing, China"],"firstName":"Zhinan","lastName":"Sun","id":"37089021825"},{"name":"Xumin Pu","affiliation":["Chongqing Key Laboratory of Mobile Communications Technology, Chongqing, China","National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Xumin","lastName":"Pu","id":"37073218700"},{"name":"Shihai Shao","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory of Science and Technology on Communications, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Shihai","lastName":"Shao","id":"37544445300"},{"name":"Shi Jin","affiliation":["National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Shi","lastName":"Jin","id":"37290425400"},{"name":"Qianbin Chen","affiliation":["Chongqing Key Laboratory of Mobile Communications Technology, Chongqing, China"],"firstName":"Qianbin","lastName":"Chen","id":"37290091200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4385-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4386-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2377-8644"}],"articleNumber":"9580373","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":85},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Costs","Numerical analysis","Detectors","Massive MIMO","Computer architecture","Approximation algorithms","MIMO"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["expectation propagation","massive MIMO","extra-large scale","signal detection","polynomial expansion"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9580373","abstract":"In this paper, we propose a low-complexity expectation propagation (EP) detector for extra-large scale massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems.

In each iteration procedure of EP algorithm, matrix inversion is the main computational burden, which is the key challenge of the practical implementation of EP detectors. In this work, we use polynomial expansion (PE) to approximate matrix inverse, which reduces the computational cost of matrix inverse in each EP iteration. A subarray architecture is considered in our scenario to fit extra-large scale antenna array.

With the rapid development of the network communications, optimizing radio resources of wireless communication has been one of the challenging issues in 5G networks. In order to effectively improve network performance, an efficient resource allocation and power optimization algorithm is necessary. In this paper, we study joint resource allocation and power optimization (JRAPO) problem in multiuser mmWave massive MIMO system, which target at increasing energy efficiency (EE) and decreasing power consumption of systems. First, the problem of JRAPO is formulated as a multivariate mixed integer nonlinear programming problem. Second, because the non-convexity of this problem, we transformed it into a convex optimization problem by relaxing the resource block (RB) allocation indicator. Finally, we used Lagrangian dual decomposition algorithm and water-filling scheme to resolve this joint optimization problem. Simulation results demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9580191","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCC52777.2021.9580377","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE/CIC International Conference on Communications in China (ICCC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE/CIC International Conference on Communications in China (ICCC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9579484/9580191/09580377.pdf","startPage":"899","endPage":"904","doi":"10.1109/ICCC52777.2021.9580377","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint Resource Allocation and Power optimization for Energy-Efficiency in Multiuser mmWave Massive MIMO System","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 July 2021","displayDocTitle":"Joint Resource Allocation and Power optimization for Energy-Efficiency in Multiuser mmWave Massive MIMO System","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"28-30 July 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9580377/","publicationDate":"28 July 2021","dateOfInsertion":"13 November 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9580377/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint Resource Allocation and Power optimization for Energy-Efficiency in Multiuser mmWave Massive MIMO System","confLoc":"Xiamen, China","sourcePdf":"p899-maimaiti.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062366S","chronDate":"28-30 July 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9579484","isNumber":"9580191","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9579484","xplore-issue":"9580191","articleId":"9580377","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-26"},{"_id":9580378,"authors":[{"name":"Shanshan Zhang","affiliation":["SICS, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, China"],"firstName":"Shanshan","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37089023739"},{"name":"Wen Chen","affiliation":["SICS, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, China"],"firstName":"Wen","lastName":"Chen","id":"37291849800"},{"name":"Shaoyuan Chen","affiliation":["SICS, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, China"],"firstName":"Shaoyuan","lastName":"Chen","id":"37089026625"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4385-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4386-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2377-8644"}],"articleNumber":"9580378","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":31},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9580378","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wireless communication","Cellular networks","Performance evaluation","Channel estimation","Machine learning","Receivers","Throughput"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["SCMA","dictionary learning (DL)","grant-free","massive connectivity","transceiver design"]}],"abstract":"With the explosively increasing demands on the network capacity, throughput and number of connected wireless devices, massive connectivity is an urgent problem for the next generation wireless communications.

An artificial neural network (ANN)-assisted receiver trained for a specific channel model is often not suitable for another channel model. In mobile communication, the wireless channel is greatly randomly affected by the wireless propagation environment. Variations in channel parameters will change the channel model, and this makes the signal detector based on deep learning use limited and poor robustness. In this paper, a continual learning method based on elastic weight consolidation(EWCCL) is proposed to solve the issue. The basic idea of this paper is to calculate the importance of each parameter to the task through the EWCCL method after the completion of one training. Then, in the next training, regular terms are added into the loss function to avoid the result of the last training being completely covered due to excessive deviation of these parameters. This method can make the neural network memorize the training results of multiple wireless channels, so it has stronger robustness to the transformation of wireless channels, and also reduces the cost of retraining. Finally, we verified this hypothesis through simulation experiments. The simulation experiment results show that the EWCCL method proposed in this paper has better detection performance and better robustness than the fine-tune method.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9580191","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCC52777.2021.9580409","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE/CIC International Conference on Communications in China (ICCC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE/CIC International Conference on Communications in China (ICCC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9579484/9580191/09580409.pdf","startPage":"534","endPage":"539","doi":"10.1109/ICCC52777.2021.9580409","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Elastic Weight Consolidation Continual Learning Based Signal Detection in Multiple Channel MIMO System","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 July 2021","displayDocTitle":"Elastic Weight Consolidation Continual Learning Based Signal Detection in Multiple Channel MIMO System","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"28-30 July 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9580409/","publicationDate":"28 July 2021","dateOfInsertion":"13 November 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9580409/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61871238,61771254"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Elastic Weight Consolidation Continual Learning Based Signal Detection in Multiple Channel MIMO System","confLoc":"Xiamen, China","sourcePdf":"p534-yang.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047299S","chronDate":"28-30 July 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9579484","isNumber":"9580191","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9579484","xplore-issue":"9580191","articleId":"9580409","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-26"},{"_id":9580415,"authors":[{"name":"Wenli Jiang","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Wireless-Optical Communications, Chinese Academy of Sciences, School of Information Science and Technology, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, Anhui, China"],"firstName":"Wenli","lastName":"Jiang"},{"name":"Weijie Liu","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Wireless-Optical Communications, Chinese Academy of Sciences, School of Information Science and Technology, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, Anhui, China"],"firstName":"Weijie","lastName":"Liu"},{"name":"Zhengyuan Xu","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Wireless-Optical Communications, Chinese Academy of Sciences, School of Information Science and Technology, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, Anhui, China"],"firstName":"Zhengyuan","lastName":"Xu"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4385-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4386-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2377-8644"}],"articleNumber":"9580415","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wireless communication","Integrated optics","Gamma distribution","Temperature","Salinity (geophysical)","Water heating","Probability density function"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["UOWC","turbulence","temperature gradient","salinity gradient","PDF","coherence time"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9580415","doi":"10.1109/ICCC52777.2021.9580415","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE/CIC International Conference on Communications in China (ICCC)","abstract":"The turbulence is an intractable issue for underwater optical wireless communication (UOWC), and limited literature has been focused on the probability density function (PDF) of the received signal.

In this environment, the channel has fast time-varying and non-stationary characteristics. And its time-domain correlation coefficient is a time-varying parameter, which makes it difficult for traditional channel estimation methods to capture the channel variations over time and achieve ideal channel estimation performance. In order to track the variations of time-varying mmWave channel and perform channel estimation, a deep learning-based channel estimation network is proposed in this paper. In the design of the deep neural network, a CNN+RNN network structure is used to learn the characteristics of channel. Considering that the 3D mmWave channel has sparsity in both spatial and frequency domains, a convolutional neural network (CNN) is used to extract the spatial-frequency domain features of the channel response. Afterwards a maximum pooling network is used to reduce the training parameters of the network. Finally, a recurrent neural network (RNN) is used to extract the time-domain correlated features of the channel response to estimate the channel. In offline training phase, channel state information (CSI) at pilot is firstly initialized by least squared method, and an incomplete channel matrix with estimated values only at the pilot point is obtained. In order to estimate the values at the data points and complete the CSI matrix, the incomplete CSI is fed into the network and standard high-speed channel data is used to train the network. Simulation results show that the proposed method can track the variations of channel characteristics in a high-speed mobile environment and achieve better performance in the online prediction phase compared to conventional methods.","doi":"10.1109/ICCC52777.2021.9580417","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9580191","startPage":"529","endPage":"533","pdfPath":"/iel7/9579484/9580191/09580417.pdf","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE/CIC International Conference on Communications in China (ICCC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE/CIC International Conference on Communications in China (ICCC)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCC52777.2021.9580417","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Deep Learning-based Channel Estimation Approach for 3D Massive MIMO Millimeter-Wave System in Time-Varying Environments","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Three-dimensional displays","Recurrent neural networks","Simulation","Millimeter wave technology","Channel estimation","Massive MIMO"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Deep Learning","3D Massive MIMO","Channel Estimation","Time-Varying"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 July 2021","displayDocTitle":"Deep Learning-based Channel Estimation Approach for 3D Massive MIMO Millimeter-Wave System in Time-Varying Environments","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9580417/","dateOfInsertion":"13 November 2021","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9580417/","publicationDate":"28 July 2021","conferenceDate":"28-30 July 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61871238,61771254"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Deep Learning-based Channel Estimation Approach for 3D Massive MIMO Millimeter-Wave System in Time-Varying Environments","confLoc":"Xiamen, China","sourcePdf":"p529-luo.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.085529S","chronDate":"28-30 July 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9579484","isNumber":"9580191","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9579484","xplore-issue":"9580191","articleId":"9580417","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-19"},{"_id":9580424,"authors":[{"name":"Qian Chen","affiliation":["Wireless Signal Processing and Network Laboratory, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Qian","lastName":"Chen"},{"name":"Xing Zhang","affiliation":["Wireless Signal Processing and Network Laboratory, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xing","lastName":"Zhang"},{"name":"Jizhe Zhou","affiliation":["Wireless Signal Processing and Network Laboratory, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jizhe","lastName":"Zhou"},{"name":"Yongdong Zhu","affiliation":["Zhejiang Lab, Zhejiang Province, China"],"firstName":"Yongdong","lastName":"Zhu"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4385-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4386-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2377-8644"}],"articleNumber":"9580424","dbTime":"24 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radio frequency","Radio transmitters","Throughput","Time division multiplexing","Scheduling","Systems simulation","Resource management"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["ambient backscatter communication","multiple transmitters","multiple receivers","time allocation","genetic algorithm"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal Time Scheduling Scheme for Multi-transmitter Multi-receiver Ambient Backscatter Communication System","doi":"10.1109/ICCC52777.2021.9580424","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9580191","endPage":"432","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE/CIC International Conference on Communications in China (ICCC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE/CIC International Conference on Communications in China (ICCC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9579484/9580191/09580424.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCC52777.2021.9580424","startPage":"427","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9580424","abstract":"Ambient backscatter communication (ABCom) is a promising green communication way. Past researches mainly focus on the system which only allows one transmitter and one receiver to communicate and shows limited improvement of network performance. Moreover, there lacks model of resource structure and research of allocation strategy in multi-transmitter multi-receiver ABCom system. In this paper, we first propose the time structure and action matrix, then study the time allocation strategy to maximize the overall throughput in the multi-transmitter multi-receiver ABCom system. In the system, transmission protocol for multiple communication groups is based on frequency division multiplexing (FDM) and time division multiplexing (TDM). Transmitters can work in the active mode and passive mode, and three actions are considered for them, i.e., harvesting energy, transmitting actively and backscattering signals. In terms of this, the time structure and action matrix are proposed. Then, a time resource scheduling scheme based on genetic algorithm is proposed. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme achieves much higher performance compared with rand scheduling and equal scheduling scheme, in terms of three dimensions: the amount of communication groups, emission power of radio frequency (RF) source and backscatter rate, respectively.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9580424/","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 July 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"28 July 2021","dateOfInsertion":"13 November 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9580424/","conferenceDate":"28-30 July 2021","displayDocTitle":"Optimal Time Scheduling Scheme for Multi-transmitter Multi-receiver Ambient Backscatter Communication System","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61631005,62071063"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal Time Scheduling Scheme for Multi-transmitter Multi-receiver Ambient Backscatter Communication System","confLoc":"Xiamen, China","sourcePdf":"p427-chen.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055664S","chronDate":"28-30 July 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9579484","isNumber":"9580191","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9579484","xplore-issue":"9580191","articleId":"9580424","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-11"},{"_id":9580425,"authors":[{"name":"Weizhi Zhang","affiliation":["Glasgow College, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Weizhi","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37089023128"},{"name":"Boxiao Shen","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Science and Technology on Communications, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Boxiao","lastName":"Shen","id":"37087323237"},{"name":"Chuan Huang","affiliation":["Future Network of Intelligence Institute and the School of Science and Engineering, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen, China"],"firstName":"Chuan","lastName":"Huang","id":"37407376100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4385-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4386-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2377-8644"}],"articleNumber":"9580425","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":45},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Deep learning","Recurrent neural networks","Codes","Detectors","Convolutional neural networks","Noise measurement"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Blind detection","deep learning","channel codes","interleaver","scrambler"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9580425","doi":"10.1109/ICCC52777.2021.9580425","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCC52777.2021.9580425","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9580191","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE/CIC International Conference on Communications in China (ICCC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE/CIC International Conference on Communications in China (ICCC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9579484/9580191/09580425.pdf","startPage":"811","endPage":"816","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Deep Learning for Blind Detection of Interleaver and Scrambler","abstract":"This paper considers the blind detection of interleaver and scrambler from the Gaussian noisy channel.

Finally, extensive experiments demonstrate that the constructed detectors can generalize new samples which are not in the training set.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9580425/","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 July 2021","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"28-30 July 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9580425/","dateOfInsertion":"13 November 2021","publicationDate":"28 July 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Deep Learning for Blind Detection of Interleaver and Scrambler","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100012166","fundingName":"National Key R&D Program of China","grantNumber":"2018YFB1800800"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"NSFC","grantNumber":"62022070"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Deep Learning for Blind Detection of Interleaver and Scrambler","confLoc":"Xiamen, China","sourcePdf":"p811-zhang.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070931S","chronDate":"28-30 July 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9579484","isNumber":"9580191","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9579484","xplore-issue":"9580191","articleId":"9580425","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-26"},{"_id":9580430,"authors":[{"name":"Huahua Xiao","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Mobile Network and Mobile Multimedia Technology, ZTE Corporation, Shenzhen, China"],"firstName":"Huahua","lastName":"Xiao"},{"name":"Hongyang Du","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Hongyang","lastName":"Du"},{"name":"Jiayi Zhang","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jiayi","lastName":"Zhang"},{"name":"Ke Guan","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Rail Traffic Control and Safety, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Ke","lastName":"Guan"},{"name":"Bo Ai","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Rail Traffic Control and Safety, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Bo","lastName":"Ai"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4385-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4386-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2377-8644"}],"articleNumber":"9580430","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fading channels","Radio frequency","Communication systems","Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces","Probability","Performance gain","Propagation losses"]}],"abstract":"TeraHertz (THz) communications are envisioned to help satisfy the ever-high data rates demand with massive bandwidth. However, THz signals are sensitive to blockage. With the help of the recently proposed reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) technology, we investigate a RIS-aided THz communication system. More specifically, we first prove that we can use the fluctuating two-ray distribution to model the small-scale amplitude fading of THz signals based on recent measurements. Furthermore, a novel swarm intelligence-based method is proposed to optimize the phase shifts at the RIS elements under discrete constraints. Finally, we investigate exact statistical characterizations of end-to-end signal-to-noise plus distortion ratio and derive closed-form outage probability. Monte-Carlo simulations are provided to validate the accuracy of our results. It is interesting to find that the impact of path loss is more pronounced compared to others, and increasing the number of elements at the RIS can significantly improve the performance of the THz communications.","doi":"10.1109/ICCC52777.2021.9580430","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE/CIC International Conference on Communications in China (ICCC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9579484/9580191/09580430.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9580191","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCC52777.2021.9580430","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE/CIC International Conference on Communications in China (ICCC)","startPage":"415","endPage":"420","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Outage Probability of Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface Aided THz Communications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9580430","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 July 2021","displayDocTitle":"Outage Probability of Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface Aided THz Communications","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9580430/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9580430/","publicationDate":"28 July 2021","dateOfInsertion":"13 November 2021","conferenceDate":"28-30 July 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"U1834210"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Outage Probability of Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface Aided THz Communications","confLoc":"Xiamen, China","sourcePdf":"p415-xiao.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.082257S","chronDate":"28-30 July 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9579484","isNumber":"9580191","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9579484","xplore-issue":"9580191","articleId":"9580430","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-11"},{"_id":9580448,"authors":[{"name":"Hongyang Jia","affiliation":["Princeton University, Princeton, NJ, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/9664397/9580448/jia-3119018-small.gif","p":["Hongyang Jia (Member, IEEE) received the B.Eng. degree in microelectronics from Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, in 2014, and the M.A. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from Princeton University, Princeton, NJ, USA, in 2016 and 2021, respectively.","His research focuses on ultra-low energy system design for inference applications.

The aim of this technique is to retrieve the geometric and dielectric properties of the neck to identify the possible presence of tumors, starting from scattered electric field data. A fully-connected neural network is developed to test the feasibility of the proposed approach. Moreover, a numerical model including the main features of a cross section of the neck is specifically designed in order to create a suitable training dataset. Subsequently, for the optimization of the ANN architecture and performance evaluation, a numerical analysis is conducted. A set of simulated cases, based on realistic neck phantoms, is tested to evaluate the robustness of the network. Preliminary results show the possibility to identify and locate neck tumors.","doi":"10.1109/OJAP.2021.3121177","startPage":"1044","endPage":"1056","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Open Journal of Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel7/8566058/9312711/09580452.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Open Journal of Antennas and Propagation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/OJAP.2021.3121177","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9312711","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Microwave Imaging of the Neck by Means of Artificial Neural Networks for Tumor Detection","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neck","Imaging","Microwave imaging","Tumors","Microwave theory and techniques","Dielectrics","Electric fields"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Microwave imaging","neck tumors","artificial neural networks","biomedical imaging","machine learning","inverse scattering"]}],"topic":"Microwave Biomedical Imaging: Innovative Methods and Systems Towards Clinical Applications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9580452/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 October 2021","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","displayDocTitle":"Microwave Imaging of the Neck by Means of Artificial Neural Networks for Tumor Detection","volume":"2","htmlLink":"/document/9580452/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"2021","dateOfInsertion":"13 November 2021","isOpenAccess":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Artificial Intelligence in Medicine (AIM) Project","grantNumber":"INFN(CSN5)"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Microwave Imaging of the Neck by Means of Artificial Neural Networks for Tumor Detection","sourcePdf":"ojap-fedeli-3121177-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.156127S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"8566058","isNumber":"9312711","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8566058","xplore-issue":"9312711","topics":["Microwave Biomedical Imaging: Innovative Methods and Systems Towards Clinical Applications"],"articleId":"9580452","onlineDate":"19 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":9580459,"authors":[{"name":"Shaohua Zhou","affiliation":["School of Microelectronics, Tianjin University, Tianjin, China","Qingdao Institute for Ocean Technology, Tianjin University, Qingdao, China"],"firstName":"Shaohua","lastName":"Zhou","orcid":"0000-0003-3292-9511","id":"37088820907"},{"name":"Jian Wang","affiliation":["School of Microelectronics, Tianjin University, Tianjin, China","Qingdao Institute for Ocean Technology, Tianjin University, Qingdao, China"],"firstName":"Jian","lastName":"Wang","orcid":"0000-0003-4361-8946","id":"37089017295"}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2168-6734"}],"articleNumber":"9580459","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":68},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Electron Devices Society","url":"http://eds.ieee.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radio frequency","Stress","Degradation","Power amplifiers","Temperature measurement","Thermal shock","Power generation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Thermal shock test","radio frequency stress","CMOS power amplifier","performance degradation"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9580459","abstract":"To accelerate the degradation of critical specifications of CMOS power amplifiers (PAs), this paper proposes a new measurement method that introduces radio frequency (RF) stress in the thermal shock test of CMOS PAs. The experimental results show that the proposed method is effective. The degradation of key PA specifications such as output power and power-added efficiency can accelerate under RF stress. Its degradation speed is faster than that under no RF stress. Possible reasons for the degradation of crucial PA specifications accelerated by RF stress are discussed and analyzed in detail in this paper. The method proposed in this paper can effectively reduce the measurement time and cost to study the degradation of critical specifications of the CMOS-based PA. This method can be used for scientific research on the performance degradation of microwave/RF circuits and devices and aging experiments of electronic products before they leave the

multiple-access (SM-SCDMA). Firstly, the approximate message passing (AMP) algorithm is adapted for the detection of SM-SCDMA, which has less than 1% detection complexity of the state-of-the-art message passing-aided (MPA) detection albeit at a bit error ratio (BER) degradation. Therefore, inspired by the benefits of interference cancellation (IC) and the unique characteristics of SM, an enhanced AMP (EAMP) detector is proposed for mitigating BER degradation without increasing the detection complexity. Finally, the classic expectation propagation (EP) is intrinsically amalgamated with our EAMP detector, leading to a novel EAMP-EP detector, which further reduces the detection complexity of the EAMP algorithm.

Typically, this difference set (or coarray) is realized by first estimating a virtual coarray covariance matrix from the sample covariance matrix. However, with only a few snapshots, these techniques incur large estimation error, which saturates away from zero even as the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) tends to infinity. We address this issue by moving away from estimating the coarray covariance matrix when snapshots are limited, and instead proposing a \u201cproxy covariance matrix\u201d (Prox-Cov) that provides an alternate estimate of the coarray subspace (but does not attempt to estimate the source powers). (Prox-Cov) is shown to outperform coarray MUSIC with limited snapshots when the number of sources exceeds the number of sensors. Moreover, when the number of sources is fewer than sensors, we prove that (Prox-Cov) leads to exact identification of the coarray subspace with very few snapshots in the absence of noise, while the error of coarray MUSIC provably saturates in this regime.","doi":"10.1109/LSP.2021.3120939","publicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/97/9325893/09580685.pdf","startPage":"2172","endPage":"2176","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9325893","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LSP.2021.3120939","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9580685","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 October 2021","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9580685/","displayDocTitle":"Beyond Coarray MUSIC: Harnessing the Difference Sets of Nested Arrays With Limited Snapshots","volume":"28","publicationDate":"2021","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9580685/","dateOfInsertion":"23 November 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000006","fundingName":"Office of Naval Research","grantNumber":"N00014-19-1-2256 and N00014-19-1-2227"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100008982","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"1700506"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Beyond Coarray MUSIC: Harnessing the Difference Sets of Nested Arrays With Limited Snapshots","sourcePdf":"lsp-sarangi-3120939-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.057035S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"97","isNumber":"9325893","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"97","xplore-issue":"9325893","articleId":"9580685","onlineDate":"19 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-27"},{"_id":9580686,"authors":[{"name":"Mohammed Sait","affiliation":["Photonics Laboratory, Computer, Electrical, and Mathematical Sciences and Engineering Division, King Abdullah University of Science and Technology, Thuwal, Saudi Arabia"],"firstName":"Mohammed","lastName":"Sait"},{"name":"Yujian Guo","affiliation":["Photonics Laboratory, Computer, Electrical, and Mathematical Sciences and Engineering Division, King Abdullah University of Science and Technology, Thuwal, Saudi Arabia"],"firstName":"Yujian","lastName":"Guo","orcid":"0000-0003-2433-5860"},{"name":"Omar Alkhazragi","affiliation":["Photonics Laboratory, Computer, Electrical, and Mathematical Sciences and Engineering Division, King Abdullah University of Science and Technology, Thuwal, Saudi Arabia"],"firstName":"Omar","lastName":"Alkhazragi","orcid":"0000-0001-6247-842X"},{"name":"Meiwei Kong","affiliation":["Photonics Laboratory, Computer, Electrical, and Mathematical Sciences and Engineering Division, King Abdullah University of Science and Technology, Thuwal, Saudi Arabia"],"firstName":"Meiwei","lastName":"Kong","orcid":"0000-0003-3907-2194"},{"name":"Tien Khee Ng","affiliation":["Photonics Laboratory, Computer, Electrical, and Mathematical Sciences and Engineering Division, King Abdullah University of Science and Technology, Thuwal, Saudi Arabia"],"firstName":"Tien Khee","lastName":"Ng","orcid":"0000-0002-1480-6975"},{"name":"Boon S.

However, implementing the NLOS link is non-trivial. While the NLOS technique relies on light scattering, i.e., channel turbulence can facilitate NLOS communication, the associated path-loss (PL) can be significant. Signal fading can degrade link robustness, which arises due to ocean water temperature and salinity fluctuation and gradients. To evaluate the robustness of NLOS in natural waters, we systematically measure the link metrics, such as the bit error ratio, PL, and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), of water bodies of uniform and nonuniform vertical salinity ranging from 30\u201340\u2030 (part-per-thousand).

The algorithmic challenge is to choose pixel positions strategically and dynamically to maximally reduce overall depth estimation error. This setting is realized in daytime or nighttime depth completion for autonomous vehicles with a programmable LiDAR. Our method uses an ensemble of predictors to define a sampling probability over pixels. This probability is proportional to the variance of the predictions of ensemble members, thus highlighting pixels that are difficult to predict. By additionally proceeding in several prediction phases, we effectively reduce redundant sampling of similar pixels. Our ensemble-based method may be implemented using any depth-completion learning algorithm, such as a state-of-the-art neural network, treated as a black box. In particular, we also present a simple and effective Random Forest-based algorithm, and similarly use its internal ensemble in our design.

When the distribution of those random variables is intractable, Monte Carlo (MC) sampling is usually required. Importance sampling is a standard MC tool that approximates this unavailable distribution with a set of weighted samples. This procedure is asymptotically consistent as the number of MC samples (particles) goes to infinity. However, retaining infinitely many particles is infeasible. Thus, we propose a way to only keep a \n<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">finite representative subset</i>\n of particles and their augmented importance weights that is \n<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">nearly consistent</i>\n, i.e., they converge to a close neighborhood of their population ground truth in the large sample limit. To do so in an online manner, we (1) embed the posterior density estimate in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) through its kernel mean embedding; and (2) sequentially project this RKHS element onto a lower-dimensional subspace in RKHS using the maximum mean discrepancy, an integral probability metric. Theoretically, we establish that this scheme results in a bias determined by a compression parameter, which yields a tunable tradeoff between consistency and memory. In experiments, we observe the compressed estimates achieve comparable performance to the dense ones with substantial reductions in representational complexity.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9580696/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 October 2021","volume":"69","publicationDate":"2021","dateOfInsertion":"13 December 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9580696/","isJournal":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Nearly Consistent Finite Particle Estimates in Streaming Importance Sampling","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100006754","fundingName":"Army Research Laboratory","grantNumber":"W911NF-16-2-0008"},{"fundingName":"Agence Nationale de la Recherche of France","grantNumber":"ANR-17-CE40-0031-01"},{"fundingName":"ARL/ARO","grantNumber":"W911NF-20-1-0126"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Nearly Consistent Finite Particle Estimates in Streaming Importance Sampling","sourcePdf":"tsp-koppel-3120512-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.129307S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"9307529","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","xplore-issue":"9307529","articleId":"9580696","onlineDate":"19 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-13"},{"_id":9580699,"authors":[{"name":"Weisong Liu","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Complex Electromagnetic Environment Effects on Electronics and Information System, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Weisong","lastName":"Liu","orcid":"0000-0001-6416-2285","id":"37088496374"},{"name":"Xueqiong Li","affiliation":["Institute for Quantum Information and State Key Laboratory of High Performance Computing, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Xueqiong","lastName":"Li","orcid":"0000-0002-2364-4947","id":"37086512778"},{"name":"Zhitao Huang","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Complex Electromagnetic Environment Effects on Electronics and Information System, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Zhitao","lastName":"Huang","id":"37289710800"},{"name":"Xiang Wang","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Complex Electromagnetic Environment Effects on Electronics and Information System, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Xiang","lastName":"Wang","id":"38248158900"}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1943-0655"},{"format":"CD","value":"1943-0647"}],"articleNumber":"9580699","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":192},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Photonics Society","url":"http://www.PhotonicsSociety.org"}],"graphicalAbstract":{"summary":"","type":"graphic","fileSize":"","file":"/ielx7/4563994/9583306/9580699/graphical_abstract/jphot-gagraphic-3121304.jpg","coverImage":"/ielx7/4563994/9583306/9580699/graphical_abstract/jphot-gagraphic-3121304.jpg"},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Feature extraction","Radio transmitters","Optical transmitters","Security","Training","Radio frequency","Visible light communication"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Physical layer security","visible light communication","transmitter fingerprinting","deep learning"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9580699","abstract":"Visible light communication (VLC) is a promising technology with a high data rate that can supplement radio frequency communication. Although VLC systems have a natural advantage of high security due to the line-of-sight light propagation characteristic, they are still vulnerable when facing an open environment. Device fingerprinting is a technique that is widely viewed to detect transmitter impersonation attack in radio frequency (RF) based wireless systems. In this paper, we introduce the fingerprinting technique to discriminate illegal transmitting devices in VLC systems. We first investigate the hardware imperfections of the VLC transmitter, which can provide a unique device ID. Then we implement a feature separation network for transmitter fingerprinting (TF-FSN) and design a two-stage training strategy to obtain a stable classifier. Finally, we experimentally demonstrate the feasibility and performance of the proposed method. The results show that the accuracy of identification and verification is 92.65% and 98%, respectively. Moreover, our method is robust over different distances and a wide range of signal-to-noise ratios.","doi":"10.1109/JPHOT.2021.3121304","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JPHOT.2021.3121304","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/4563994/9583306/09580699.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Journal","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9583306","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Transmitter Fingerprinting for VLC Systems via Deep Feature Separation Network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 October 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2021","displayDocTitle":"Transmitter Fingerprinting for VLC Systems via Deep Feature Separation Network","publicationDate":"Dec. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2021","externalId":"7300407","volume":"13","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9580699/","isOpenAccess":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9580699/","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"62101575"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Transmitter Fingerprinting for VLC Systems via Deep Feature Separation Network","sourcePdf":"jphot-li-3121304-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.123117S","chronDate":"Dec.  2021","xplore-pub-id":"4563994","isNumber":"9583306","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4563994","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"9583306","articleId":"9580699","onlineDate":"19 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2022-01-10"},{"_id":9580704,"authors":[{"name":"Yuto Sumiya","affiliation":["Nagoya Institute of Technology, Nagoya, Japan"],"firstName":"Yuto","lastName":"Sumiya","id":"37088686366"},{"name":"Tomoki Otsuka","affiliation":["Nagoya Institute of Technology, Nagoya, Japan"],"firstName":"Tomoki","lastName":"Otsuka","id":"37088599434"},{"name":"Yoshihiro Maeda","affiliation":["Tokyo University of Science, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Yoshihiro","lastName":"Maeda","orcid":"0000-0001-6919-637X","id":"37089250895"},{"name":"Norishige Fukushima","affiliation":["Nagoya Institute of Technology, Nagoya, Japan"],"firstName":"Norishige","lastName":"Fukushima","orcid":"0000-0001-8320-6407","id":"37409895700"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1070-9908"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2361"}],"articleNumber":"9580704","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":68},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Gaussian Fourier Pyramid for Local Laplacian Filter","abstract":"Multi-scale processing is essential in image processing and computer graphics. Halos are a central issue in multi-scale processing.

Its processing is costly; thus, an approximated acceleration of fast LLF was proposed to linearly interpolate multiple Laplacian pyramids.

Besides, the violent environment variations severely confuse trackers that neglect temporal environmental changes among consecutive frames, leading to unwanted tracking drift. In this letter, we propose a novel DCF-based tracking method to promote the insensitivity of the tracker under uncertain environmental changes. Specifically, a regularization term is proposed to learn the environment residual between two adjacent frames, which can enhance the discrimination and insensitivity of the filter in fickle tracking scenarios. Further, we design an efficient strategy to acquire the environment information based on the current observation without additional computation.

Firstly, using the optimal precoding matrix as a label, a new CNN architecture is constructed, which can be trained to learn how to predict the vectorized hybrid precoder. Furthermore, a two-stage hybrid precoding scheme is proposed. In the first stage, the proposed CNN learns how to minimize the residual between the hybrid precoder and the optimal precoder when it only has the estimated channel as its input. Specifically, two special network layers are designed to satisfy the constraint conditions of the output. In the second stage, the estimated channel is fed into the well-trained CNN, correspondingly, the analog precoding matrix and the digital precoding matrix are output. Simulation results and complexity analysis show that under certain conditions, the proposed method offers better spectral efficiency than the other related methods with acceptable complexity.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Two-Stage Hybrid Precoding for Minimizing Residuals Using Convolutional Neural Network","doi":"10.1109/LCOMM.2021.3121475","endPage":"3907","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/4234/9644612/09580823.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","startPage":"3903","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCOMM.2021.3121475","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9644612","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9580823","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radio frequency","Precoding","Convolutional neural networks","Channel estimation","Optimized production technology","Training","Receivers"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Hybrid precoding","convolutional neural network","minimum residual","millimeter-wave","MIMO"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Two-Stage Hybrid Precoding for Minimizing Residuals Using Convolutional Neural Network","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9580823/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 October 2021","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2021","volume":"25","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/9580823/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"09 December 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Nature Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61971117"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003787","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Hebei Province","grantNumber":"F2020501007"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Two-Stage Hybrid Precoding for Minimizing Residuals Using Convolutional Neural Network","sourcePdf":"lcomm-zhang-3121475-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043537S","chronDate":"Dec.  2021","xplore-pub-id":"4234","isNumber":"9644612","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4234","xplore-issue":"9644612","articleId":"9580823","onlineDate":"19 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-10"},{"_id":9580825,"authors":[{"name":"Yan Wu","affiliation":["Army Engineering University of PLA, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Yan","lastName":"Wu","orcid":"0000-0002-6237-9090"},{"name":"Dan Wu","affiliation":["Army Engineering University of PLA, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Dan","lastName":"Wu","orcid":"0000-0002-2722-8676"},{"name":"Chao Yue","affiliation":["Army Engineering University of PLA, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Chao","lastName":"Yue"},{"name":"Yang Yang","affiliation":["Army Engineering University of PLA, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Yang","lastName":"Yang"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"9580825","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":52},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9580825","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Games","Resource management","Ultra reliable low latency communication","Error probability","Device-to-device communication","Receivers","Transmitters"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["URLLC","D2D","potential game","resource reservation","contention-based access"]}],"abstract":"This letter investigates the ultra-reliable and low-latency link allocation for device-to-device (D2D) communications in face of sporadic packet arrivals. Specifically, contention-based access scheme has been widely used to achieve low-latency transmission, where the users can randomly access the pre-reserved resource pool without resource scheduling. However, considering the inconsistent packet arrivals and heterogeneous spatial distribution of D2D pairs (DPs), some DPs who are closely located or have more frequent packet arrivals are more likely to suffer collisions, which seriously deteriorates their reliability performance. In this context, the resource reservation can well offset the weaknesses of contention-based access scheme by reserving dedicated links to these DPs. Then, the hybrid link allocation issue is formulated as the optimization problem which aims to minimize the sum packet error probability under the low latency constraint. Moreover, an exact potential game model and a blocking-pair based best response algorithm are proposed. Simulation results verify the superiority of the proposed hybrid link allocation scheme.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9674048","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCOMM.2021.3121515","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/4234/9674048/09580825.pdf","startPage":"212","endPage":"216","doi":"10.1109/LCOMM.2021.3121515","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint Reservation and Contention-Based Access for URLLC-Enabled D2D Communications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2022","displayDocTitle":"Joint Reservation and Contention-Based Access for URLLC-Enabled D2D Communications","volume":"26","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/9580825/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2022","dateOfInsertion":"07 January 2022","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9580825/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 October 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61671474"},{"fundingName":"Jiangsu Provincial Natural Science Foundation for Excellent Young Scholars","grantNumber":"BK20170089"},{"fundingName":"Jiangsu Provincial Natural Science Fund for Outstanding Young Scholars","grantNumber":"BK20180028"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint Reservation and Contention-Based Access for URLLC-Enabled D2D Communications","sourcePdf":"lcomm-wu-3121515-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.065661S","chronDate":"Jan.  2022","xplore-pub-id":"4234","isNumber":"9674048","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4234","xplore-issue":"9674048","articleId":"9580825","onlineDate":"19 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2022","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-10"},{"_id":9580830,"authors":[{"name":"Xinyu Huang","affiliation":["School of Engineering, Australian National University, Canberra, ACT, Australia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/9681827/9580830/huang-3121439-small.gif","p":["Xinyu Huang (Student Member, IEEE) received the joint B.Eng. degree (Hons.) in electronic and communication systems from Australian National University, Canberra, Australia, and Northwestern Polytechnical University, China, in 2018.

For the MF-based TX, the molecule release probability and the fraction of molecules released from the TX membrane are derived. Incorporating molecular degradation and a fully-absorbing receiver (RX), the channel impulse response (CIR) is derived for two scenarios: 1) Both TX and RX are static, and 2) both TX and RX are diffusion-based mobile. Moreover, a sequence of bits transmitted from the TX to the RX is considered. The average bit error rate (BER) is obtained for both scenarios, wherein the probability mass function (PMF) of the number of molecules absorbed in the mobile scenario is derived. Furthermore, a simulation framework is proposed for the MF-based TX, based on which the derived analytical expressions are validated. Simulation results show that a low MF probability or low vesicle mobility slows the release of molecules and reduces the molecule hitting probability at the RX. Simulation results also indicate the difference between the MF-based TX and an ideal point TX in terms of the inter-symbol interference (ISI).","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2021.3121439","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2021.3121439","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9681827","startPage":"132","endPage":"148","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/9681827/09580830.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9580830","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Biomembranes","Proteins","Chemicals","Bit error rate","Biological system modeling","Three-dimensional displays","Stochastic processes"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Molecular communication","imperfect transmitter design","membrane fusion","channel impulse response","diffusive mobile transmitter and receiver"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Membrane Fusion-Based Transmitter Design for Static and Diffusive Mobile Molecular Communication Systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2022","isJournal":true,"volume":"70","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2022","dateOfInsertion":"14 January 2022","htmlLink":"/document/9580830/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 October 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9580830/","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001782","fundingName":"Doreen Thomas Postdoctoral Fellowship at the University of Melbourne"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Membrane Fusion-Based Transmitter Design for Static and Diffusive Mobile Molecular Communication Systems","sourcePdf":"tcomm-huang-3121439-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.146977S","chronDate":"Jan.  2022","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"9681827","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","xplore-issue":"9681827","articleId":"9580830","onlineDate":"19 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2022","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-23"},{"_id":9580839,"authors":[{"name":"Maksym Paliy","affiliation":["Universit\u00e0 di Pisa, Pisa, Italy"],"bio":{"p":["Maksym Paliy received the M.S. degree in electronic engineering from the University of Calabria (UNICAL), Rende, Italy, in 2016, with a thesis titled \u201cDesign of 3T CMOS Current Reference for Ultra-Low Voltage Application.\u201d He is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree in electronic engineering with the University of Pisa (UNIPI), Pisa, Italy.","He is developing analog neural networks with CMOS and beyond CMOS technologies.

According to special properties of massive MIMO systems, we propose a novel limited-memory BFGS (L-BFGS) scheme for MMSE detection with one correction search, unit step length, and simplified initialization, which can greatly reduce the storage and computation cost compared to BFGS method.

This phenomenon degrades channel estimation accuracy, and hence it is necessary to be compensated to realize reliable communications. Decision feedback channel estimation (DFCE) has been widely considered as the channel tracking approach. It still causes estimation errors due to the decision-making process in the presence of time and frequency selective fading environments. To address these issues, this paper newly proposes a generalized regression neural network (GRNN) based channel tracking scheme incorporated with frequency-domain CSI smoothing. The latter part is the key to improve the dependability of the training data sets. Computer simulation results confirm that the proposed scheme can achieve superior BER performance and the lower root mean square error (RMSE) value of estimated CSI better than the conventional ones.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3121399","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/9312710/09580848.pdf","startPage":"142425","endPage":"142436","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3121399","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9312710","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Generalized Regression Neural Network Based Fast Fading Channel Tracking Using Frequency-Domain CSI Smoothing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9580848/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 October 2021","displayDocTitle":"Generalized Regression Neural Network Based Fast Fading Channel Tracking Using Frequency-Domain CSI Smoothing","volume":"9","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"26 October 2021","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"2021","htmlLink":"/document/9580848/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100016397","fundingName":"Artificial Intelligence Research Promotion Foundation"},{"fundingName":"KAKENHI Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research (B)","grantNumber":"20H04178"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Generalized Regression Neural Network Based Fast Fading Channel Tracking Using Frequency-Domain CSI Smoothing","sourcePdf":"access-kojima-3121399-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.079562S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"9312710","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","xplore-issue":"9312710","articleId":"9580848","onlineDate":"19 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":9580852,"authors":[{"name":"Muhammad Hussain","affiliation":["Bahria University, Karachi, Pakistan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/9312710/9580852/hussa-3121533-small.gif","p":["Muhammad Hussain received the B.E. degree in electronic engineering and the master\u2019s degree in communications engineering from the NED University of Engineering and Technology, Karachi, Pakistan.

These devices which include smart meters, sensors and actuators etc. suffer from impulse noise (IN) while operating with power systems. Furthermore, NOMA scheme provides power domain multiple access (PDMA) which is found to be susceptible to IN. Based on the aforementioned IN intervention and its degrading effect on communication applications, novel mechanisms are desired to mitigate and classify the IN induced in the received signal. In this research work, novel IN mitigation and classification techniques are presented using deep learning methods for NOMA-based communication systems. The IN detection is performed by first identifying the IN occurrences using a deep neural network (DNN) which learns statistical traits of noisy samples followed by removal of harmful effect of IN in the detected occurrences. Using the proposed DNN, higher bit error rates (BER) were achieved when compared with the existing IN detection methods. The proposed method was further validated for high and low IN, and weak and strong IN occurrence probabilities. Moreover, another deep learning network is proposed in this research work to effectively distinguish between high IN and low IN in the noise contaminated NOMA symbols which can help improve the performance of IN detection models. Both of the deep learning methods proposed in this study show strong potential to address IN problem faced by the NOMA scheme.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/9312710/09580852.pdf","startPage":"143836","endPage":"143846","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3121533","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3121533","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9312710","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9580852","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Deep Learning Approaches for Impulse Noise Mitigation and Classification in NOMA-Based Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["NOMA","Deep learning","Blanking","OFDM","Bit error rate","Resource management","Smart grids"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Deep neural network (DNN)","impulse noise (IN)","multiuser communication","non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA)","power division multiple access (PDMA)","successive interference cancellation (SIC)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9580852/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 October 2021","displayDocTitle":"Deep Learning Approaches for Impulse Noise Mitigation and Classification in NOMA-Based Systems","volume":"9","htmlLink":"/document/9580852/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"2021","dateOfInsertion":"27 October 2021","isOpenAccess":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Deep Learning Approaches for Impulse Noise Mitigation and Classification in NOMA-Based Systems","sourcePdf":"access-shakir-3121533-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.080699S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"9312710","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","xplore-issue":"9312710","articleId":"9580852","onlineDate":"19 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-11-06"},{"_id":9580854,"authors":[{"name":"Christof Beierle","affiliation":["Faculty of Computer Science, Ruhr University Bochum, Bochum, Germany"],"bio":{"p":["Christof Beierle received the Ph.D. degree from the Faculty of Mathematics, Ruhr University Bochum, Germany, in 2018, under the supervision of Gregor Leander for his work on the design and analysis of lightweight block ciphers.

This goes hand in hand with a quasilinear construction, encoding, and successive cancellation list decoding procedures based on the Plotkin construction. The decoding algorithm can be applied with slight modifications to Reed-Muller or eBCH codes, that both achieve the capacity of erasure channels, although the list size needed for good performance grows too fast to make the decoding practical even for moderate block lengths. The key ingredient for proving the capacity-achieving property of Reed-Muller and eBCH codes is their group of symmetries. It can be plugged into the concept of Plotkin decomposition to design various permutation decoding algorithms. Although such techniques allow to outperform the straightforward polar-like decoding, the complexity stays impractical. In this paper, we show that although invariance under a large automorphism group is valuable in a theoretical sense, it also ensures that the list size needed for good performance grows exponentially. We further establish the bounds that arise if we sacrifice some of the symmetries. Although the theoretical analysis of the list decoding algorithm remains an open problem, our result provides an insight into the factors that impact the decoding complexity.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2021.3121442","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/9681827/09580884.pdf","startPage":"163","endPage":"170","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2021.3121442","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9681827","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9580884","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Efficiency of Polar-Like Decoding for Symmetric Codes","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"On the Efficiency of Polar-Like Decoding for Symmetric Codes","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9580884/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 October 2021","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2022","volume":"70","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9580884/","dateOfInsertion":"14 January 2022","publicationDate":"Jan. 2022","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001703","fundingName":"\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Efficiency of Polar-Like Decoding for Symmetric Codes","sourcePdf":"tcomm-ivanov-3121442-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.097463S","chronDate":"Jan.  2022","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"9681827","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"9681827","articleId":"9580884","onlineDate":"19 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2022","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-23"},{"_id":9580885,"authors":[{"name":"Wenjing Zhao","affiliation":["School of Information and Communication Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China","School of Information and Communication Engineering, Dalian University of Technology, Dalian, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/9681827/9580885/wzhao-3121426-small.gif","p":["Wenjing Zhao received the B.S. degree in mathematics and applied mathematics from Liaoning Normal University, Liaoning, China, in 2012, the M.S. degree in fundamental mathematics from Northeast Normal University, Changchun, China, in 2015, and the Ph.D. degree from the School of Information and Communication Engineering, Dalian University of Technology, Dalian, China, in 2020.

Optimized Traffic Engineering (TE) approaches can be used to improve QoS in SDWS-IoT. Most of the existing related works offer Inefficient flow management, Higher power consumption, Non-QoS awareness, Low network lifetime, Tedious network management, etc. Considering these issues in existing related solutions, this work proposes a QoS aware optimized TE approach for efficient flow management in SDWS-IoT network, called QuOTE. It collects the network-wide link QoS statistics and computes the optimized path with respect to different network QoS constraints. The proposed solution is implemented using CPLEX Optimization solver, MATLAB, and Python APIs. The results are compared with some state-of-the-art approaches w.r.t. some well-known QoS metrics.

However, their resiliency to time, location, and/or configuration changes in the operating environment undoubtedly remains one major challenge that lies ahead in their deployment pathway. In this paper, we present an experimental framework that aims to disclose, understand and overcome the sensitivity of LoRa device fingerprinting to variations in deployment settings. We first began by presenting our RF fingerprinting datasets, collected from 25 different LoRa devices. The datasets cover a comprehensive set of experimental scenarios, considering both indoor and outdoor environments with varying network deployment settings, such as varying the distance between the transmitters and the receiver, the configuration of the LoRa protocol, the physical location of the conducted experiment, and the receiver hardware used for capturing the fingerprints. We then proposed a new technique that leverages out-of-band spectrum distortions, that are caused by device-specific hardware impairments, to provide unique device signatures that we exploit to improve fingerprinting accuracy. Finally, we conducted an experimental study that discloses the sensitivity of deep learning-based RF fingerprinting to changes in various deployment settings while considering three data representations of the learning model input: time-domain IQ, frequency-domain FFT, and Amplitude/Phase polar-coordinate. We found that the learning models perform relatively well when trained and tested under the same deployment settings, with FFT representation yielding the best performance followed by IQ representation. However, when trained and tested under different settings, the models (i) fail to maintain their high accuracy when the channel conditions change, and (ii) completely lose their ability to classify devices when the LoRa configuration and/or the USRP receiver hardware change. In addition, we interestingly observed that FFT representation performs exceptionally poorly when training and testing are done under different deployment settings, regardless of the type of the setting change.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3121606","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3121606","startPage":"142893","endPage":"142909","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/9312710/09580899.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9312710","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"LoRa Device Fingerprinting in the Wild: Disclosing RF Data-Driven Fingerprint Sensitivity to Deployment Variability","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 October 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","displayDocTitle":"LoRa Device Fingerprinting in the Wild: Disclosing RF Data-Driven Fingerprint Sensitivity to Deployment Variability","publicationDate":"2021","dateOfInsertion":"26 October 2021","volume":"9","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9580899/","isOpenAccess":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9580899/","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Machine Learning for Wireless Networking Systems (MLWiNS) NSF/Intel, Award","grantNumber":"#2003273"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"LoRa Device Fingerprinting in the Wild: Disclosing RF Data-Driven Fingerprint Sensitivity to Deployment Variability","sourcePdf":"access-hamdaoui-3121606-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.087656S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"9312710","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","xplore-issue":"9312710","articleId":"9580899","onlineDate":"19 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-12-26"},{"_id":9580907,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The signal transmission of both stages experience frequency selectivity. The relay is powered both by an energy source through the wireless power transfer as well as by the energy recycled from its own self-interference during the second stage. Accordingly, we jointly design the power allocations both at the multiple source nodes and at a common relay node for maximizing the network\u2019s sum-throughput, which poses a large-scale nonconvex problem, regardless whether proper Gaussian signaling (PGS) or improper Gaussian signaling (IGS) is used for signal transmission to the relay. We develop new alternating descent procedures for solving our joint optimization problems, which are based on closed-forms and thus are of very low computational complexity even for large numbers of subcarriers. The results show the superiority of IGS over PGS in terms of both its sum-rate and individual user-rate. Another benefit of IGS over PGS is that the former promises fairer rate distribution across the subcarriers. Moreover, the recycled self-interference also provides a beneficial complementary energy source.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2021.3120714","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/9681827/09580907.pdf","startPage":"291","endPage":"305","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9681827","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2021.3120714","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2022","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 October 2021","displayDocTitle":"Relay-Aided Multi-User OFDM Relying on Joint Wireless Power Transfer and Self-Interference Recycling","volume":"70","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/9580907/","dateOfInsertion":"14 January 2022","publicationDate":"Jan. 2022","isJournal":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9580907/","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Deanship of Research Oversight and Coordination (DROC) at KFUPM"},{"fundingName":"Interdisciplinary Research Center for Communication Systems and Sensing through project","grantNumber":"INCS2111"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000923","fundingName":"Australian Research Council\u2019s Discovery Projects","grantNumber":"DP190102501"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"U.S. National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"CCF-1908308"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000266","fundingName":"Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council projects and (COALESCE) as well as of the European Research Council\u2019s Advanced Fellow Grant Quant-Com","grantNumber":"EP/P034284/1, EP/P003990/1 and 789028"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Relay-Aided Multi-User OFDM Relying on Joint Wireless Power Transfer and Self-Interference Recycling","sourcePdf":"tcomm-hanzo-3120714-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.106183S","chronDate":"Jan.  2022","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"9681827","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","xplore-issue":"9681827","articleId":"9580907","onlineDate":"19 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2022","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-23"},{"_id":9580920,"authors":[{"name":"Leonardo Ravaglia","affiliation":["Electronic and Information Engineering (DEI), University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5503868/9647029/9580920/ravag-3121554-small.gif","p":["Leonardo Ravaglia received the M.Sc. degree in automation engineering from the University of Bologna in 2019, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree in data science and computation.

However, there is still a lot of uncertainties regarding the precise link between peripheral and central autonomic biosignals. Clarifying these links could have a profound impact on the interpretability, and thus usefulness, of peripheral autonomic biosignals captured with wearable devices. In this study, we take advantage of a unique dataset consisting of intracranial stereo-electroencephalography (SEEG) and peripheral biosignals acquired simultaneously for several days from four subjects undergoing epilepsy monitoring. Compared to previous work, we apply a deep neural network to explore high-dimensional nonlinear correlations between the cerebral brainwaves and variations in heart rate and electrodermal activity (EDA). Further, neural network explainability methods were applied to identify most relevant brainwave frequencies, brain regions and temporal information to predict a specific biosignal. Strongest brain-peripheral correlations were observed from contacts located in the central autonomic network, in particular in the alpha, theta and 52 to 58 Hz frequency band. Furthermore, a temporal delay of 12 to 14 s between SEEG and EDA signal was observed. Finally, we believe that this pilot study demonstrates a promising approach to mapping brain-peripheral relationships in a data-driven manner by leveraging the expressiveness of deep neural networks.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-10 Sept. 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9581203/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9581203/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"13 November 2021","conferenceDate":"5-10 Sept. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Exploring Relationships between Cerebral and Peripheral Biosignals with Neural Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Exploring Relationships between Cerebral and Peripheral Biosignals with Neural Networks","confLoc":"Chicago, IL, USA","sourcePdf":"168500a103.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.112253S","chronDate":"5-10 Sept. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9581155","isNumber":"9581058","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9581155","xplore-issue":"9581058","articleId":"9581203","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-10"},{"_id":9581310,"authors":[{"name":"Ji-Hun Lee","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, South Korea","System LSI, Samsung Electronics Company Ltd., Hwaseong, South Korea"],"firstName":"Ji-Hun","lastName":"Lee","orcid":"0000-0002-8377-257X","id":"37085999609"},{"name":"Hyun-Sik Kim","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Hyun-Sik","lastName":"Kim","orcid":"0000-0002-4564-7938","id":"37066747100"}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2573-9603"}],"articleNumber":"9581310","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":74},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9581310","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Switches","Topology","Inductors","Solid state circuits","Linearity","Power generation","Power amplifiers"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["BD (ternary) modulation","class-D audio amplifier (CDA)","fully differential","inductor-freewheeling","linear buck-boost converter","switched-mode audio amplifier (SMAA)"]}],"abstract":"This letter presents a fully differential single-inductor linear buck-boost power topology-based switched-mode audio amplifier.

Due to the nonlinear feature of electric loads and the uncertainties in the modern power systems, deep learning algorithms are frequently applied to STLF problem which can be described as an arduous challenge because of being affected by several impacts.

MCS is vulnerable to many types of threats and faces many challenges. Trustworthiness is one of the main MCS challenges; attackers aim to inject faulty data to corrupt the system or waste its resources. Thus, MCS organizers must ensure that no malicious users are contributing to have trusted sensed data. Faulty sensor readings in MCS can be due to sensor failure or malicious behavior. Attackers targets degrade the system performance and reduce the worker's reputation by injecting false data. This paper evaluates different machine learning algorithms classifying the received sensed data as true, a faulty sensor, or attacker behavior. These algorithms are Decision Tree (DT), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Random Frost (RF). Evaluating the result for comparison obtained based on accuracy, precision, Recall, f1 score, and the confusion matrix. The result shows that among all classifiers, RF shows the highest accuracy of 97.9\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">%.</sup>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9581443/","chronOrPublicationDate":"29-30 Sept. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"29 Sept. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"13 November 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9581443/","conferenceDate":"29-30 Sept. 2021","displayDocTitle":"AI-Based Anomaly and Data Posing Classification in Mobile Crowd Sensing","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"AI-Based Anomaly and Data Posing Classification in Mobile Crowd Sensing","confLoc":"Zallaq, Bahrain","sourcePdf":"1570732928.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05361S","chronDate":"29-30 Sept. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9581281","isNumber":"9581338","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9581281","xplore-issue":"9581338","articleId":"9581443","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-18"},{"_id":9581491,"authors":[{"name":"Jongyeop Kim","affiliation":["Georgia Southern University, Statesboro, GA, U.S.A"],"firstName":"Jongyeop","lastName":"Kim","id":"37087078901"},{"name":"Hayden Wimmer","affiliation":["Georgia Southern University, Statesboro, GA, U.S.A"],"firstName":"Hayden","lastName":"Wimmer","id":"37085884720"},{"name":"Hong Liu","affiliation":["Indiana University Kokomo, Kokomo, IN, U.S.A"],"firstName":"Hong","lastName":"Liu","id":"37087081504"},{"name":"Seongsoo Kim","affiliation":["Georgia Southern University, Statesboro, GA, U.S.A"],"firstName":"Seongsoo","lastName":"Kim","id":"37087080961"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-7681-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-7682-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9581491","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":34},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Deep learning","Systematics","Machine learning algorithms","Predictive models","Big Data","Data science","Data models"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cryptocurrency","Big Data","Data streaming","Finance Data","LSTM","web scraping"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9581491","abstract":"Big data analysis for accurate predictions requires adherence to systematic procedures.

This depicts the natural limitation of a human in maintaining Traffic rules. To avoid any lethal circumstance assistive driving vehicles are introduced which consists of systems that guide drivers in different Traffic situations. Traffic sign recognition systems play a crucial role in assistive driving vehicles these systems have been based on characteristics of the sign and two-state detectors due to accuracy and real-time factors systems on these bases are not used for real-time application. In this paper, we present a system that can recognize Traffic signs and their distance from the vehicle in non-ideal lighting as well as in varying climatic conditions. Our work proceeds with the implementation of YOLOv3(deep convolutional network based on end-to-end detection algorithm) used for Traffic sign recognition and segmentation. Training of the model is done with GTSRB dataset and achieves an accuracy of about 98.5% for the recognition task in different real-time scenarios. Furthermore, an efficient Heuristic-based approach has been deployed for estimating the distance between the Traffic sign and the monocular camera(placed in the vehicle) at every instance.","doi":"10.1109/3ICT53449.2021.9581655","startPage":"154","endPage":"159","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 International Conference on Innovation and Intelligence for Informatics, Computing, and Technologies (3ICT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9581281/9581338/09581655.pdf","publicationTitle":"2021 International Conference on Innovation and Intelligence for Informatics, Computing, and Technologies (3ICT)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/3ICT53449.2021.9581655","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9581338","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Traffic Sign Recognition and Distance Estimation with YOLOv3 model","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Technological innovation","Roads","Neurons","Estimation","Feature extraction","Real-time systems"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Traffic sign recognition","Distance estimation","YOLOv3","Convolution neural network"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9581655/","chronOrPublicationDate":"29-30 Sept. 2021","displayDocTitle":"Traffic Sign Recognition and Distance Estimation with YOLOv3 model","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9581655/","publicationDate":"29 Sept. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"13 November 2021","conferenceDate":"29-30 Sept. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Traffic Sign Recognition and Distance Estimation with YOLOv3 model","confLoc":"Zallaq, Bahrain","sourcePdf":"1570734997.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057448S","chronDate":"29-30 Sept. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9581281","isNumber":"9581338","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9581281","xplore-issue":"9581338","articleId":"9581655","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-08"},{"_id":9581711,"authors":[{"name":"Lu Zhang","affiliation":["Ministry of Education, Engineering Research Center of Smart Microsensors and Microsystems, Hangzhou Dianzi University, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Lu","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37088415148"},{"name":"Kuiwen Xu","affiliation":["Ministry of Education, Engineering Research Center of Smart Microsensors and Microsystems, Hangzhou Dianzi University, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Kuiwen","lastName":"Xu","id":"37085705830"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7335096-1-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3377-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9581711","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":15},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Dielectric constant","Imaging","Sampling methods","Numerical simulation","Microwave theory and techniques","Real-time systems","Convolutional neural networks"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["a hybrid input scheme","Back-propagation (BP)","direct sampling method (DSM)"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9581711","doi":"10.23919/ACES-China52398.2021.9581711","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/ACES-China52398.2021.9581711","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9581331","publicationTitle":"2021 International Applied Computational Electromagnetics Society (ACES-China) Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 International Applied Computational Electromagnetics Society (ACES-China) Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel7/9581280/9581331/09581711.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"2","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Hybrid Input Scheme for Deep-Learning Based Quantitative Microwave Imaging","abstract":"This paper proposes a hybrid input scheme to train U-net convolutional neural networks (CNN).

This paper presents the design considerations and possible architectures for implementations of high-speed, high-resolution, and low power SAR ADC for direct RF sampling applications and proposes a 12-bit 6-GS/s pipelined SAR hybrid ADC intended for Direct RF Sampling Receivers.","doi":"10.1109/ICORT52730.2021.9581884","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICORT52730.2021.9581884","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 2nd International Conference on Range Technology (ICORT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9581283/9581335/09581884.pdf","publicationTitle":"2021 2nd International Conference on Range Technology (ICORT)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9581335","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Considerations for Design of High Speed High Resolution Low Power SAR ADC for Direct RF Sampling Receivers","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"5-6 Aug. 2021","displayDocTitle":"Considerations for Design of High Speed High Resolution Low Power SAR ADC for Direct RF Sampling Receivers","conferenceDate":"5-6 Aug. 2021","publicationDate":"5 Aug. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"13 November 2021","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9581884/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9581884/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Considerations for Design of High Speed High Resolution Low Power SAR ADC for Direct RF Sampling Receivers","confLoc":"Chandipur, Balasore, India","sourcePdf":"1570727080.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056018S","chronDate":"5-6 Aug. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9581283","isNumber":"9581335","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9581283","xplore-issue":"9581335","articleId":"9581884","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-26"},{"_id":9581943,"authors":[{"name":"Dilber \u00c7etinta\u015f","affiliation":["Firat University Information Technologies, Elazi\u011f, Turkey"],"firstName":"Dilber","lastName":"\u00c7etinta\u015f","id":"37086734695"},{"name":"Taner Tuncer Firat","affiliation":["University Computer Engineering, Elazi\u011f, Turkey"],"firstName":"Taner Tuncer","lastName":"Firat","id":"37089019664"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4032-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4033-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9581943","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":28},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9581943","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiplexing","Deep learning","Support vector machines","Visualization","Technological innovation","Computer architecture","Informatics"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["eye-tracking","pupil diameter","deep learning","spectrogram"]}],"abstract":"The eyes are a rich source of information about mental activities as well as providing the perception of the outside world.

In this study, an estimate of what type of text is read was made using the analysis of eye movements during daily reading activity. In the study, deep learning approaches were preferred due to the insufficient results of machine learning approaches before. Multiplexing was performed using a dataset with 52 features consisting of 20 participants (10 males, 10 females). 627 data were obtained as a result of multiplexing from 20 data. As a result of the creation of visual representations (spectrograms) of the data produced in sufficient numbers and processing with deep learning architectures, a good success rate of 97.88% was achieved with AlexNet. While the best values in news and text types were obtained with AlexNet and Resnet101, better results were produced with ResNet18 and ResNet50 in comedy with high visual content. It was noticed that the success rate in women was higher in documents with visual content.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9581338","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/3ICT53449.2021.9581943","publicationTitle":"2021 International Conference on Innovation and Intelligence for Informatics, Computing, and Technologies (3ICT)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 International Conference on Innovation and Intelligence for Informatics, Computing, and Technologies (3ICT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9581281/9581338/09581943.pdf","startPage":"512","endPage":"515","doi":"10.1109/3ICT53449.2021.9581943","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Eye-Tracking Analysis with Deep Learning Method","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"29-30 Sept. 2021","displayDocTitle":"Eye-Tracking Analysis with Deep Learning Method","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"29-30 Sept. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9581943/","publicationDate":"29 Sept. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"13 November 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9581943/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Eye-Tracking Analysis with Deep Learning Method","confLoc":"Zallaq, Bahrain","sourcePdf":"1570735013.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046002S","chronDate":"29-30 Sept. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9581281","isNumber":"9581338","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9581281","xplore-issue":"9581338","articleId":"9581943","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-26"},{"_id":9581987,"authors":[{"name":"Emine Cengil","affiliation":["Firat University, Elazi\u011f, Turkey"],"firstName":"Emine","lastName":"Cengil","id":"37086225373"},{"name":"Ahmet \u00c7inar","affiliation":["Firat University, Elazi\u011f, Turkey"],"firstName":"Ahmet","lastName":"\u00c7inar","id":"37993295800"},{"name":"Muhammet Yildirim","affiliation":["Firat University, Elazi\u011f, Turkey"],"firstName":"Muhammet","lastName":"Yildirim","id":"37089019160"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4032-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4033-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9581987","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":128},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Technological innovation","Cats","Sensitivity","Dogs","Object detection","Approximation algorithms"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["YOLOv5","Oxford pets dataset","cat and dog detection"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9581987","abstract":"Object detection is a common research topic for many fields. In particular, objects that are close together are difficult to detect. The breed of cats and dogs includes many species. These species are similar to each other and to some species in the other class. Therefore, it is difficult to distinguish the faces of cats and dogs, especially for some species. The study uses the YOLO algorithms, which has very high sensitivity and speed in numerous object detection challenges. The Oxford pets dataset, consisting of approximately 3600 images, containing images from 37 different types of cat/dog classes, is utilized for training and testing. We propose a method based on YOLOv5 to find cats and dogs. We utilized the YOLOv5 algorithm with different parameters. Four different models are compared and evaluated. Experiments demonstrate that YOLOv5 models achieve successful results for the respective task. The mAP of YOLOv5l is 94.1, demonstrating the efficacy of YOLOv5-based cat/dog detection.","doi":"10.1109/3ICT53449.2021.9581987","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/3ICT53449.2021.9581987","startPage":"149","endPage":"153","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 International Conference on Innovation and Intelligence for Informatics, Computing, and Technologies (3ICT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9581281/9581338/09581987.pdf","publicationTitle":"2021 International Conference on Innovation and Intelligence for Informatics, Computing, and Technologies (3ICT)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9581338","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Case Study: Cat-Dog Face Detector Based on YOLOv5","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"29-30 Sept. 2021","displayDocTitle":"A Case Study: Cat-Dog Face Detector Based on YOLOv5","conferenceDate":"29-30 Sept. 2021","publicationDate":"29 Sept. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"13 November 2021","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9581987/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9581987/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Case Study: Cat-Dog Face Detector Based on YOLOv5","confLoc":"Zallaq, Bahrain","sourcePdf":"1570734913.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059704S","chronDate":"29-30 Sept. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9581281","isNumber":"9581338","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9581281","xplore-issue":"9581338","articleId":"9581987","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-26"},{"_id":9582080,"authors":[{"name":"Satyajit Swain","affiliation":["School of Computer Engineering, Kalinga Institute of Industrial Technology, Bhubaneswar, Odisha"],"firstName":"Satyajit","lastName":"Swain","id":"37089018931"},{"name":"Mainak Bandyopadhyay","affiliation":["School of Computer Engineering, Kalinga Institute of Industrial Technology, Bhubaneswar, Odisha"],"firstName":"Mainak","lastName":"Bandyopadhyay","id":"37089019074"},{"name":"Suresh Chandra Satapathy","affiliation":["School of Computer Engineering, Kalinga Institute of Industrial Technology, Bhubaneswar, Odisha"],"firstName":"Suresh Chandra","lastName":"Satapathy","id":"37088924733"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4956-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4957-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9582080","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":11},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Earth","Deep learning","Measurement","Analytical models","Recurrent neural networks","Memory management","Long short term memory"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Deep Learning","Hyperspectral Imaging","Recurrent Neural Networks","Long Short Term Memory"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9582080","abstract":"Development in the field of computer-aided learning and testing have stimulated the progress of novel and efficient knowledge-based expert systems, that have shown hopeful outcomes in a broad variety of practical applications.

Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) is an evolving area in the study of remotely sensed data due to the huge volume of information found in these images, which enables better classification and processing of the Earth's surface by integrating ample of spatial and spectral features. This paper primarily deals with the Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), especially the Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) networks for HSI classification. Different variants of LSTM are analyzed and compared, along with other state-of-the-art models in terms of accuracy metrics using certain hyperspectral datasets.

Story-point estimation enables software development teams to, among other things, better scope products, prioritize requirements, allocate resources and measure progress. Several machine learning techniques have been proposed for automated story-point estimation. However, most of these techniques use open-source projects for evaluation. There are important differences between open-source and commercial projects with respect to story authoring. The goal of this paper is to evaluate a state-of-the-art machine learning technique, known as Deep-SE [3], for estimating story points in a commercial project. Our dataset is comprised of 4,727 stories for a data anonymization product developed by a 27-member agile team at a healthcare data science company, IQVIA. Over this dataset, Deep-SE achieved a mean absolute error of 1.46, significantly better than three different baselines. Model performance nonetheless varied across stories, with the estimation error being larger for stories that had higher points. Our results further indicate that model performance is correlated with certain story characteristics such as the level of detail and the frequency of vague terms in the stories. An important take-away from our study is that, before organizations attempt to introduce machine learning-based estimation into agile development, they need to better embrace agile best practices, particularly in relation to story authoring and expert-based estimation.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9582276","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/REW53955.2021.00022","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 29th International Requirements Engineering Conference Workshops (REW)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 29th International Requirements Engineering Conference Workshops (REW)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9581322/9582276/09582288.pdf","startPage":"106","endPage":"115","doi":"10.1109/REW53955.2021.00022","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Machine Learning-based Estimation of Story Points in Agile Development: Industrial Experience and Lessons Learned","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-24 Sept. 2021","displayDocTitle":"Machine Learning-based Estimation of Story Points in Agile Development: Industrial Experience and Lessons Learned","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"20-24 Sept. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9582288/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"27 October 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9582288/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Machine Learning-based Estimation of Story Points in Agile Development: Industrial Experience and Lessons Learned","confLoc":"Notre Dame, IN, USA","sourcePdf":"189800a106.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.090197S","chronDate":"20-24 Sept. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9581322","isNumber":"9582276","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9581322","xplore-issue":"9582276","articleId":"9582288","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-26"},{"_id":9582340,"authors":[{"name":"Lanyu Shang","affiliation":["University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, Champaign, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Lanyu","lastName":"Shang","id":"37086606024"},{"name":"Christina Youn","affiliation":["University of Notre Dame, Notre Dame, IN, USA"],"firstName":"Christina","lastName":"Youn","id":"37089006715"},{"name":"Yuheng Zha","affiliation":["University of Notre Dame, Notre Dame, IN, USA"],"firstName":"Yuheng","lastName":"Zha","id":"37089006688"},{"name":"Yang Zhang","affiliation":["University of Notre Dame, Notre Dame, IN, USA"],"firstName":"Yang","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37086295205"},{"name":"Dong Wang","affiliation":["University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, Champaign, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Dong","lastName":"Wang","id":"37405344500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-0361-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4708-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9582340","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":37},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Knowledge engineering","Visualization","Social networking (online)","Conferences","Knowledge based systems","Performance gain","Graph neural networks"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Offensive Meme","Hate Speech","Knowledge Base","Online Social Media"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9582340","abstract":"This paper studies a critical problem of identifying offensive meme posts on online social media where images are superimposed with deliberately altered or crafted captions to deliver offensive information. Existing solutions often ignore the implicit relationship between visual and textual contents in the meme and their implied meanings, which are critical to accurately detect offensive memes. Two important challenges exist in solving the problem: i) how to effectively incorporate human commonsense knowledge to capture the symbolic or implied meaning of the meme contents that implicitly deliver offensive information? ii) How to accurately identify the cross-modal knowledge-based relations between entities in both the visual and textual content of the meme that jointly insinuate offensive messages? To address the above challenges, we develop KnowMeme, a knowledge-enriched graph neural network solution that leverages knowledge facts from human commonsense knowledge to effectively detect offensive meme posts on online social media.

The necessity to fine-tune these networks to predict facial expressions is highlighted. Several models are presented based on lightweight architectures, such as MobileNet, EfficientNet and RexNet. It was experimentally demonstrated that they lead to near state-of-the-art results in age, gender and race recognition on the UTKFace dataset and emotion classification on the AffectNet dataset. Moreover, it is shown that the usage of the trained models as feature extractors of facial regions in video frames leads to 4.5% higher accuracy than the previously known state-of-the-art single models for the AFEW and the VGAF datasets from the EmotiW challenges.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9582440","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SISY52375.2021.9582508","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 19th International Symposium on Intelligent Systems and Informatics (SISY)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 19th International Symposium on Intelligent Systems and Informatics (SISY)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9582419/9582440/09582508.pdf","startPage":"119","endPage":"124","doi":"10.1109/SISY52375.2021.9582508","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Facial expression and attributes recognition based on multi-task learning of lightweight neural networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 Sept. 2021","displayDocTitle":"Facial expression and attributes recognition based on multi-task learning of lightweight neural networks","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"16-18 Sept. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9582508/","publicationDate":"16 Sept. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"26 October 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9582508/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100006769","fundingName":"Russian Science Foundation"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Facial expression and attributes recognition based on multi-task learning of lightweight neural networks","confLoc":"Subotica, Serbia","sourcePdf":"21_sisy2021.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.090893S","chronDate":"16-18 Sept. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9582419","isNumber":"9582440","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9582419","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"9582440","articleId":"9582508","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-03"},{"_id":9582586,"authors":[{"name":"Jennifer Horkoff","affiliation":["Chalmers | University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden"],"firstName":"Jennifer","lastName":"Horkoff","id":"37316516400"},{"name":"Miroslaw Staron","affiliation":["Chalmers | University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden"],"firstName":"Miroslaw","lastName":"Staron","id":"37282730000"},{"name":"Wilhelm Meding","affiliation":["Ericsson, Sweden"],"firstName":"Wilhelm","lastName":"Meding","id":"37076569000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-2705-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-2706-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9582586","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Industries","Unified modeling language","Taxonomy","Companies","Machine learning","Manuals"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["data anomalies","anomaly modeling"]}],"abstract":"As technology has allowed us to collect large amounts of industrial data, it has become critical to analyze and understand the data collected, in particular to find data anomalies. Anomaly analysis allows a company to detect, analyze and understand anomalous or unusual data patterns. This is an important activity to understand, for example, deviations in service which may indicate potential problems, or differing customer behavior which may reveal new business opportunities. Much previous work has focused on anomaly detection, in particular using machine learning. Such approaches allow clustering of data patterns by common attributes, and, although useful, clusters often do not correspond to the root causes of anomalies, meaning that more manual analysis is needed. In this paper we report on a design science study with two different teams, in a partner company which focuses on modeling and understanding the attributes and root causes of data anomalies. After iteration, for each team, we have created general and anomaly-specific UML class diagrams and goal models to capture anomaly details. We use our experiences to create an example taxonomy, classifying anomalies by their root causes, and to create a general method for modeling and understanding data anomalies. This work paves the way for a better understanding of anomalies and their root causes, leading towards creating a training set which may be used for machine learning approaches.","doi":"10.1109/SEAA53835.2021.00024","publicationTitle":"2021 47th Euromicro Conference on Software Engineering and Advanced Applications (SEAA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 47th Euromicro Conference on Software Engineering and Advanced Applications (SEAA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9582417/9582554/09582586.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SEAA53835.2021.00024","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9582554","startPage":"119","endPage":"128","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Method for Modeling Data Anomalies in Practice","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9582586","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Method for Modeling Data Anomalies in Practice","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 Sept. 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9582586/","conferenceDate":"1-3 Sept. 2021","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"27 October 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9582586/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Method for Modeling Data Anomalies in Practice","confLoc":"Palermo, Italy","sourcePdf":"270500a119.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04764S","chronDate":"1-3 Sept. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9582417","isNumber":"9582554","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9582417","xplore-issue":"9582554","articleId":"9582586","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-06"},{"_id":9582620,"authors":[{"name":"Heyi Li","affiliation":["Beijing Laboratory of Future IC Technology and Science, School of Integrated Circuit, Peking University, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/9625642/9582620/li-3114189-small.gif","p":["Heyi Li (Graduate Student Member, IEEE) was born in Sichuan, China, in 1995.

The sensing capacitors are interfaced with a zoom CDC, which consists of a successive-approximation-register (SAR) analog-to-digital converter (ADC) and a 3rd-order delta\u2013sigma modulator (\n<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\Delta \\Sigma \\text{M}$ </tex-math></inline-formula>\n).

To improve the energy efficiency of the CDC across the full input range, a power-aware floating inverter amplifier (FIA) array is proposed, which is configured based on the conversion results of the SAR logic.

In an indoor environment, there can be many multipath reflections, from different angles of arrivals; and, when the signal bandwidth is relatively narrow, the received signal from the LOS path is often obscured by the overlapping received multipath signals. In this case, accurate estimation of the LOS TOA and AOA is challenging. In this paper, we present a novel estimator for the LOS TOA and AOA in multipath conditions, by obtaining an approximate distribution for the received signals of all the antennas. We approximate as Gaussian the distribution of the received signals given the LOS TOA and AOA, as well as additional clusters\u2019 mean AOAs; and subsequently derive a maximum likelihood estimator for the LOS TOA and AOA. We also further derive an estimation algorithm with reduced complexity. The performance of the LOS TOA and AOA estimation algorithm in challenging multipath conditions is evaluated. The results show, that the proposed estimator achieves a performance advantage compared to reference methods for sufficiently high SNR.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2021.3121635","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9307529","startPage":"5907","endPage":"5919","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/78/9307529/09582766.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Time of Arrival and Angle of Arrival Estimation Algorithm in Dense Multipath","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9582766/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 October 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9582766/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Time of Arrival and Angle of Arrival Estimation Algorithm in Dense Multipath","publicationDate":"2021","dateOfInsertion":"09 November 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"69","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Time of Arrival and Angle of Arrival Estimation Algorithm in Dense Multipath","sourcePdf":"tsp-bialer-3121635-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073593S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"9307529","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","xplore-issue":"9307529","articleId":"9582766","onlineDate":"20 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-12"},{"_id":9582795,"authors":[{"name":"Zecheng Li","affiliation":["Department of Computing, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Kowloon, Hong Kong"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/71/9603995/9582795/li-3121562-small.gif","p":["Zecheng Li received the BEng degree from the School of Information Science and Technology, Southeast University, Nanjing, China, in 2017.

Current countermeasures such as Certificate Transparency (CT) can only detect unauthorized certificates rather than preventing them. In this article, we present \n<sc xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Pistis</small>\n, a framework for issuing authorized and trusted certificates with the distributed ledger and Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) technology. In \n<sc xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Pistis</small>\n, TEE nodes validate whether the domain in a requested certificate passes the domain ownership validation (i.e., under corresponding applicants\u2019 control) and submit attested results to a smart contract in the distributed ledger. The smart contract issues a certificate to the applicant when an attested result shows a pass. Therefore, \n<sc xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Pistis</small>\n can ensure its issued certificates are authorized due to the domain ownership validation mechanism in the TEE.

Wi-Fi spy cameras are used extensively by various adversaries because of easy installability, followed by size reduction. To prevent invasions of privacy, most studies have detected wireless cameras based on video traffic analysis and require additional synchronous data from external sensors or stimulus hardware to confirm the user\u2019s motion. Such supplements make the users uncomfortable, requiring extra effort and time for setting. This paper proposes an effective spy camera detection system called \n<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">DeepDeSpy</i>\n to detect the recording of a spy camera with no effort from the user. The core idea is using the channel state information (CSI) and the network traffic from the camera to detect whether the wireless camera records the movements of the user. The CSI signal is prone to motion, and detecting motion from an enormous amount of CSI data in real-time is challenging. This was handled by leveraging the convolutional neural network (CNN) and bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) deep learning methods. Such synergistic CNN and BiLSTM deep learning models enable instant and accurate detection by automatically extracting meaningful features from the sequential raw CSI data. The feasibility of \n<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">DeepDeSpy</i>\n was verified by implementing it on both a PC and a smartphone and evaluating it in real-life scenarios (e.g., various room sizes and user physical activities). The average accuracy achieved in different real-life settings was approximately 96%, reaching 98.9% with intensive physical activity in the large-size room.

With a uniform sampling strategy to explore the state space, a feasible path can be found without the complex geometric modeling of the configuration space. However, the quality of the initial solution is not guaranteed, and the convergence speed to the optimal solution is slow. In this paper, we present a novel image-based path planning algorithm to overcome these limitations. Specifically, a generative adversarial network (GAN) is designed to take the environment map (denoted as RGB image) as the input without other preprocessing works. The output is also an RGB image where the promising region (where a feasible path probably exists) is segmented. This promising region is utilized as a heuristic to achieve non-uniform sampling for the path planner. We conduct a number of simulation experiments to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, and the results demonstrate that our method performs much better in terms of the quality of the initial solution and the convergence speed to the optimal solution. Furthermore, apart from the environments similar to the training set, our method also works well on the environments which are very different from the training set.","doi":"10.1109/JAS.2021.1004275","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JAS.2021.1004275","publicationTitle":"IEEE/CAA Journal of Automatica Sinica","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/CAA Journal of Automatica Sinica","pdfPath":"/iel7/6570654/9583158/09582813.pdf","startPage":"64","endPage":"74","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9583158","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9582813/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 October 2021","chronOrPublicationDate":"January  2022","displayDocTitle":"Generative Adversarial Network Based Heuristics for Sampling-Based Path Planning","volume":"9","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9582813/","dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2021","publicationDate":"January 2022","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Generative Adversarial Network Based Heuristics for Sampling-Based Path Planning","sourcePdf":"JAS090105.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.130308S","chronDate":"January  2022","xplore-pub-id":"6570654","isNumber":"9583158","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6570654","xplore-issue":"9583158","articleId":"9582813","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2022","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":9582823,"authors":[{"name":"Zihang Yao","affiliation":["Institute of Parallel and Distributed Systems, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/71/9603995/9582823/yao-3121568-small.gif","p":["Zihang Yao is currently working toward the graduate degree at Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China.

With the increasing scale of RDF graphs and the concurrency level of SPARQL queries, current RDF systems are confronted with inefficient concurrent query processing on massive data parallelism. The situation becomes more severe in the face of data-intensive queries (aka heavy query), which usually lead to suboptimal response time (latency) as well as throughput collapse. In this article, we present Wukong+G, the first graph-based distributed RDF query processing system that efficiently exploits the hybrid parallelism of CPU and GPU. Wukong+G is made fast and concurrent with four key designs. First, Wukong+G tames massive random memory accesses in graph exploration by efficiently mapping data between CPU and GPU for latency hiding, including a set of techniques like query-aware prefetching, pattern-aware pipelining and fine-grained swapping. Second, Wukong+G scales up by introducing a GPU-friendly RDF store to support RDF graphs exceeding GPU memory size, by using techniques like predicate-based grouping, pairwise caching and look-ahead replacing to narrow the gap between host and device memory scale. Third, Wukong+G scales out through a communication layer that decouples the transferring process for query metadata and intermediate results, and further leverages both native and GPUDirect RDMA to enable efficient communication on a CPU/GPU cluster. Finally, Wukong+G simultaneously runs multiple queries on a single GPU to improve overall throughput and fully exploits hardware heterogeneity (CPU/GPU) by scheduling a single query on CPU and GPU adaptively. We have implemented Wukong+G by extending a state-of-the-art distributed RDF store (i.e., Wukong) with distributed GPU support. Evaluation on a heterogeneous CPU/GPU cluster with RDMA-capable network shows that Wukong+G outperforms Wukong by up to 9.0\u00d7 (from 2.3\u00d7) and scales well on 10 GPU cards for heavy queries. Wukong+G can also improve both latency and throughput by more than one order of magnitude when facing hybrid workloads.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Wukong+G: Fast and Concurrent RDF Query Processing Using RDMA-Assisted GPU Graph Exploration","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","doi":"10.1109/TPDS.2021.3121568","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/71/9603995/09582823.pdf","startPage":"1619","endPage":"1635","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPDS.2021.3121568","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9603995","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9582823","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9582823/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 October 2021","chronOrPublicationDate":"July 1 2022","displayDocTitle":"Wukong+G: Fast and Concurrent RDF Query Processing Using RDMA-Assisted GPU Graph Exploration","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"33","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/9582823/","dateOfInsertion":"04 November 2021","publicationDate":"1 July 2022","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100012166","fundingName":"National Key Research and Development Program of China","grantNumber":"2020YFB2104100"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61772335 and 61925206"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003816","fundingName":"Huawei Technologies"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wukong+G: Fast and Concurrent RDF Query Processing Using RDMA-Assisted GPU Graph Exploration","sourcePdf":"tpds-chen-3121568-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.132209S","chronDate":"July 1 2022","xplore-pub-id":"71","isNumber":"9603995","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"71","xplore-issue":"9603995","articleId":"9582823","onlineDate":"20 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2022","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-06"},{"_id":9582836,"authors":[{"name":"Junhui Qian","affiliation":["School of Microelectronic and Communication Engineering, Chongqing University, Chongqing, China","Chongqing Key Laboratory of Bio-perception and Intelligent Information Processing, Chongqing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/9307529/9582836/qian-3121090-small.gif","p":["Junhui Qian (Member, IEEE) received the Ph.D. degree in signal and information processing from the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China, in 2018.

The degrees of freedom for system design are the radar probing signal, the radar receive filters at each range gate, and the communication codebook, under the usual constraints on the transmit power and on the similarity of the radar waveform to a reference signal. We derive a sub-optimal procedure that allows to decompose the non-convex optimizations at the hand into a sequence of simpler sub-problems.

However, traditional calibrations suffer inaccuracy and inconsistency. To address these problems, this paper proposes a monocular visual-inertial and robotic-arm calibration in a unifying framework. In our method, the spatial relationship is geometrically correlated between the sensing units and robotic arm. The decoupled estimations on rotation and translation could reduce the coupled errors during the optimization. Additionally, the robotic calibration moving trajectory has been designed in a spiral pattern that enables full excitations on 6 DOF motions repeatably and consistently. The calibration has been evaluated on our developed platform. In the experiments, the calibration achieves the accuracy with rotation and translation RMSEs less than 0.7\u00b0 and 0.01 m, respectively. The comparisons with state-of-the-art results prove our calibration consistency, accuracy and effectiveness.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"January  2022","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9583163/","volume":"9","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/9583163/","publicationDate":"January 2022","accessionNumber":"21226418","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2021","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 October 2021","displayDocTitle":"Monocular Visual-Inertial and Robotic-Arm Calibration in a Unifying Framework","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61903357,62022088"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002858","fundingName":"China Postdoctoral Science Foundation","grantNumber":"2020M672600"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001729","fundingName":"Swedish Foundation for Strategic Research","grantNumber":"APR20-0023"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Monocular Visual-Inertial and Robotic-Arm Calibration in a Unifying Framework","sourcePdf":"JAS090112.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.137057S","chronDate":"January  2022","xplore-pub-id":"6570654","isNumber":"9583158","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6570654","xplore-issue":"9583158","articleId":"9583163","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2022","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-12-20"},{"_id":9583192,"authors":[{"name":"Kajal Chatterjee","affiliation":["CHRIST (Deemed to be) University, Bangalore, Karnataka, India"],"firstName":"Kajal","lastName":"Chatterjee","id":"37089006537"},{"name":"Mohammad S.

Various procedures are proposed to classify soil types in the literature, but many of them consumed much time or required specially designed equipments/applications. Classification of soil involves the accounting of various factors due to its diversified nature. It can be observed that several critical domain-oriented decisions often depend on the type of soil like farmers might be benefitted from knowing the kind of soil to choose crops accordingly for cultivation. We have employed different Convolution Neural Network (CNN) architectures to identify the soil type accurately in real-time. This paper describes the comparative evaluation in terms of performances of various CNN architectures, namely, ResNet50, VGG19, MobileNetV2, VGG16, NASNetMobile, and InceptionV3. These CNN models are used to classify four types of soils: Clay, Black, Alluvial, and Red. The performance of the ResNet50 model is the best with a training accuracy and training loss of 99.47% and 0.0252, respectively compared to other competing models considered in this paper.","doi":"10.1109/CCCI52664.2021.9583192","pdfPath":"/iel7/9583171/9583183/09583192.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 International Conference on Communications, Computing, Cybersecurity, and Informatics (CCCI)","publicationTitle":"2021 International Conference on Communications, Computing, Cybersecurity, and Informatics (CCCI)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCCI52664.2021.9583192","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9583183","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Classification of Soil Images using Convolution Neural Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9583192/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 Oct. 2021","displayDocTitle":"Classification of Soil Images using Convolution Neural Networks","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"27 October 2021","publicationDate":"15 Oct. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9583192/","conferenceDate":"15-17 Oct. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Classification of Soil Images using Convolution Neural Networks","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"1570755696.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069099S","chronDate":"15-17 Oct. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9583171","isNumber":"9583183","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9583171","xplore-issue":"9583183","articleId":"9583192","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":9583201,"authors":[{"name":"Chunli Song","affiliation":["University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China, 100876"],"firstName":"Chunli","lastName":"Song","id":"37089006683"},{"name":"Xin Zhang Beijing","affiliation":["University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China, 100876"],"firstName":"Xin Zhang","lastName":"Beijing","id":"37089006747"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3208-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3209-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9583201","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":17},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fading channels","NOMA","Monte Carlo methods","Probability","Physical layer security","Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces","Power system reliability"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Fisher-Snedecor \u2131 Composite Fading Channel","NOMA","outage probability","PLS","RIS","SOP"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we investigate the physical layer security (PLS) for reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) system over generalized fading channels.

We investigate the joint optimization of the time allocation for wireless energy transfer (WET) and wireless information transfer (WIT) with the design for energy beams while minimizing the transmit power at the HAP for efficient use of its available resources. However, this is a non-convex problem, and it is numerically intractable to solve it. In the literature, the traditional approach to solving this problem is based on an iterative algorithm that incurs high computational and time complexity, which is not feasible for real-time applications. We study and analyze a deep neural network (DNN)-based scheme and propose a faster and more efficient approach for the fair approximation of a near-optimal solution to this problem. To train the proposed DNN, we acquire training data samples from a sequential parametric convex approximation (SPCA)-based iterative algorithm. Instead of acquiring data samples and training the DNN, which is highly complex, we use offline training for the DNN to provide a faster solution to the real-time resource allocation optimization problem. Through the simulation results, we show the proposed DNN scheme provides a fair approximation of the traditional SPCA method with low computational and time complexity.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3121724","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/9312710/09583222.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9312710","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3121724","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","startPage":"142795","endPage":"142803","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Deep Learning\u2013Based Energy Beamforming With Transmit Power Control in Wireless Powered Communication Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9583222","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 October 2021","displayDocTitle":"Deep Learning\u2013Based Energy Beamforming With Transmit Power Control in Wireless Powered Communication Networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9583222/","volume":"9","htmlLink":"/document/9583222/","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"2021","dateOfInsertion":"26 October 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003725","fundingName":"National Research Foundation of Korea through the Korean Government Ministry of Science and ICT (MSIT)","grantNumber":"2021R1A2B5B01001721"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Deep Learning\u2013Based Energy Beamforming With Transmit Power Control in Wireless Powered Communication Networks","sourcePdf":"access-hameed-3121724-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.087729S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"9312710","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","xplore-issue":"9312710","articleId":"9583222","onlineDate":"21 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-11-02"},{"_id":9583228,"authors":[{"name":"Anzhelika Mezina","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Communication (FEEC), Brno University of Technology, Brno, Czech Republic"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/9312710/9583228/mezin-3121998-small.gif","p":["Anzhelika Mezina received the bachelor\u2019s and master\u2019s degrees in information security from the Brno University of Technology, in 2018 and 2020, respectively, where she is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree.

Today, the importance of this topic is even higher, since the network traffic is growing and there is a need to have smart algorithms, which can automatically adapt to new network conditions, detect threats and recognize the type of the possible network attack. Nowadays, there are a lot of different approaches, some of them have reached relatively sufficient accuracy. However, the majority of works are being tested on old datasets, which do not reflect current network conditions and it leads to overfitted results. This is caused by high redundancy of the data and because they fail to reflect the performance of the latest methods in the real-world anomaly detection applications. In this work, we applied a couple of new methods based on convolutional neural networks: U-Net based and Temporal convolutional network based for network attack classification. We trained and evaluated methods on the old dataset KDD99 and the modern large-scale one CSE-CIC-IDS2018. According to results, Temporal convolutional network with LSTM has achieved accuracy 92% and 97% on the KDD99 and the CSE-CIC-IDS2018 respectively, the U-Net model has accuracy 93% and 94% on the KDD99 and the CSE-CIC-IDS2018 respectively. Additionally, we utilized the focal loss function in the Temporal convolutional network with Long Short-Term Memory model, which has positive effect on class imbalance in time-series data. We showed, that the Temporal convolutional network in combination with Long Short-Term Memory network and U-Net model can give higher accuracy compared to other network architectures for network traffic classification. In this work we also proved, that methods trained on the old dataset can easily overfit during training and achieve relatively good results on the testing set, but at the same time, these methods are not so successful on more complex and actual data.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Network Anomaly Detection With Temporal Convolutional Network and U-Net Model","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3121998","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/9312710/09583228.pdf","startPage":"143608","endPage":"143622","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3121998","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9312710","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9583228","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9583228/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 October 2021","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","displayDocTitle":"Network Anomaly Detection With Temporal Convolutional Network and U-Net Model","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"9","htmlLink":"/document/9583228/","dateOfInsertion":"27 October 2021","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Network Anomaly Detection With Temporal Convolutional Network and U-Net Model","sourcePdf":"access-mezina-3121998-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.127028S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"9312710","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","xplore-issue":"9312710","articleId":"9583228","onlineDate":"21 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-11-06"},{"_id":9583232,"authors":[{"name":"Lingling Duan","affiliation":["Institute of Complexity Science, Qingdao University, Qingdao, China","Jining University, Jining, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/19/9259274/9583232/lduan-3121502-small.gif","p":["Lingling Duan was born in China in 1982.

The application of noise to nondifferentiable activation functions enables a proper definition of the gradients, and the injected noise is treated as a network parameter that can be adaptively updated by a stochastic gradient descent learning rule. This noise-boosted backpropagation learning process is found to converge to a nonzero optimized level of noise, indicating that the injected noise is beneficial both for the learning and for the ensuing retrieval phase. For minimizing the total error energy of the function approximation in the designed threshold neural network, the proposed noise-boosted backpropagation learning method is proven to be better than directly injecting noise into network inputs or weight coefficients. The Lipschitz continuous property of the noise-smoothed activation function in the hidden unit layer is demonstrated to guarantee the local convergence of the learning process. Beyond the Gaussian injected noise, the optimal noise type is also numerically solved for training the designed threshold neural network. Test experiments for approximating nonlinear functions and real-world datasets verify the feasibility of this noise-boosted backpropagation algorithm in the threshold neural network. These results not only extend the analysis of the beneficial effects of noise similar to stochastic resonance and exploited here to the universal approximation capabilities of threshold neural networks, but also allow backpropagation training of neural networks with a much wider family of nondifferentiable activation functions.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9583232/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 October 2021","isJournal":true,"externalId":"1010612","volume":"70","htmlLink":"/document/9583232/","publicationDate":"2021","dateOfInsertion":"13 November 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Noise-Boosted Backpropagation Learning of Feedforward Threshold Neural Networks for Function Approximation","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100007129","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Shandong Province"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100010040","fundingName":"Taishan Scholar Project of Shandong Province of China","grantNumber":"TS20190930"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000923","fundingName":"Australian Research Council","grantNumber":"DP200103795"},{"fundingName":"Shandong Key Laboratory of Industrial Control Technology"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Noise-Boosted Backpropagation Learning of Feedforward Threshold Neural Networks for Function Approximation","sourcePdf":"tim-duan-3121502-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.134952S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"19","isNumber":"9259274","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"19","xplore-issue":"9259274","articleId":"9583232","onlineDate":"21 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":9583242,"authors":[{"name":"Mahdiyeh Eslami","affiliation":["Kerman Branch, Islamic Azad University, Kerman, Iran"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/9312710/9583242/eslam-3122020-small.gif","p":["Mahdiyeh Eslami (Member, IEEE) received the B.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from Shahid Bahonar University, Kerman, Iran, in 2000, the M.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from the Iran University of Science and Technology (IUST), Tehran, Iran, in 2004, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from the National University of Malaysia (UKM), in 2012.

To provide a fine balance between the explorative and exploitative behavior, MSSO utilizes a chaotic velocity damping factor. In addition, the proposed method considers a reasonable velocity limitation to avoid explosion and divergence of the sperm movement. The proposed algorithm is benchmarked with a set of test functions and the results are compared with the standard sperm swarm optimization (SSO) and some other robust metaheuristic from the literature. To demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method in power systems, power system stabilizers (PSS) and thyristor-controlled series capacitor (TCSC) controllers are designed for a 5-area 16-machine system. The performance of the suggested controllers on a multi-machine power system under various operating situation is evaluated using a nonlinear time-domain simulation. As results demonstrate, the MSSO is superior and could generates better optimal solutions in compared with SSO and other competitive algorithms. The numerical results reveal that, for damping oscillation problem the modified algorithm (MSSO) converges faster than the other methods.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9583242/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 October 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9583242/","dateOfInsertion":"13 November 2021","publicationDate":"2021","volume":"9","isOpenAccess":true,"isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Optimum Design of Damping Controllers Using Modified Sperm Swarm Optimization","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100006013","fundingName":"United Arab Emirates University","grantNumber":"31R224-RTTSC (1) 2019"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Optimum Design of Damping Controllers Using Modified Sperm Swarm Optimization","sourcePdf":"access-eslami-3122020-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.099277S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"9312710","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","xplore-issue":"9312710","articleId":"9583242","onlineDate":"21 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-12-26"},{"_id":9583252,"authors":[{"name":"Md Shazzad Hossain","affiliation":["Drexel University, Philadelphia, PA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5503868/9647029/9583252/hossa-3121687-small.gif","p":["Md Shazzad Hossain (Member, IEEE) received the B.Sc. degree in electrical and electronic engineering from American International University Bangladesh, Bangladesh, in 2011, and the M.Sc. degree in computer engineering from Drexel University, PA, USA, in 2016.

Despite the superior throughput and performance of custom accelerators as compared to CPUs or GPUs, the energy efficiency and versatility of state-of-the-art DNN accelerators is constrained due to a) the storage and movement of a large volume of data and b) the limited scope of monolithic architectures, where the entire accelerator executes only a single model at any given time. In this paper, a multi-voltage domain heterogeneous DNN accelerator is proposed that executes multiple models simultaneously with different power-performance operating points. The proposed architecture concurrently implements near-memory computing and leakage reuse, where the leakage current of idle memory banks within each processing element is utilized to deliver current to the adjacently placed multiply-and-accumulate (MAC) units. The proposed architecture and circuit techniques are evaluated with SPICE simulation in a 65 nm CMOS technology. The simulation results indicate that the proposed heterogeneous architecture with leakage reuse results in an energy efficiency of 3.27 tera-operations per second per watt (TOPS/W) as compared to a conventional monolithic and single voltage domain architecture that exhibits an energy efficiency of 0.0458 TOPS/W. In addition, the proposed accelerator that implements the leakage reuse technique on only half of the memory elements storing the weights reduces the power consumption of the sub-arrays of processing elements by 26% (99.4 mW) as compared to an accelerator that does not apply leakage reuse.","doi":"10.1109/JETCAS.2021.3121687","pdfPath":"/iel7/5503868/9647029/09583252.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Emerging and Selected Topics in Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Emerging and Selected Topics in Circuits and Systems","startPage":"762","endPage":"775","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JETCAS.2021.3121687","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9647029","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9583252/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 October 2021","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2021","displayDocTitle":"Leakage Reuse for Energy Efficient Near-Memory Computing of Heterogeneous DNN Accelerators","isJournal":true,"volume":"11","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Dec. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"13 December 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9583252/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Leakage Reuse for Energy Efficient Near-Memory Computing of Heterogeneous DNN Accelerators","sourcePdf":"jetcas-hossain-3121687-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.071387S","chronDate":"Dec.  2021","xplore-pub-id":"5503868","isNumber":"9647029","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5503868","xplore-issue":"9647029","articleId":"9583252","onlineDate":"21 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-13"},{"_id":9583253,"authors":[{"name":"Markus L\u00f6schenbrand","affiliation":["SINTEF Energy Research, Trondheim, Norway"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/9312710/9583253/losch-3121988-small.gif","p":["Markus L\u00f6schenbrand received the M.Sc. degree in supply chain management from the Vienna University of Economics and Business (WU Vienna), in 2015, and the Ph.D. degree from the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU), Trondheim, Norway, in 2019.

This paper aims to extend the literature on these methods by proposing a novel deep-learning model based on a mixture of convolutional neural networks, transformer models and dynamic Bayesian networks. Further, the paper also illustrates how to utilize Stochastic Variational Inference for training output distributions that allow time series sampling, a possibility not given for most state-of-the-art methods which do not use distributions. On top of this, the model also proposes an encoder-decoder topology that uses matrix transposes in order to both train on the sequential and the feature dimension. The performance of the work is illustrated on both load and generation time series obtained from a site representative of distributed energy resources in Norway and compared to state-of-the-art methods such as long-short-term memory. With a single-minute prediction resolution and a single-second computation time for an update with a batch size of 100 and a horizon of 24 hours, the model promises performance capable of real-time application. In summary, this paper provides a novel model that allows generating future scenarios for time series of distributed energy resources in real-time, which can be used to generate profiles for control problems under uncertainty.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3121988","startPage":"147029","endPage":"147041","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3121988","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9312710","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/9312710/09583253.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Temporal Neural Network Model for Probabilistic Multi-Period Forecasting of Distributed Energy Resources","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9583253/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Temporal Neural Network Model for Probabilistic Multi-Period Forecasting of Distributed Energy Resources","volume":"9","htmlLink":"/document/9583253/","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"2021","dateOfInsertion":"13 November 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 October 2021","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100005416","fundingName":"Centre for Intelligent Electricity Distribution (CINELDI), an Eight Year Research Centre under the FME-Scheme, Centre for Environment-Friendly Energy Research","grantNumber":"257626/E20"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100005416","fundingName":"Norges Forskningsr\u00e5d"},{"fundingName":"CINELDI Partners"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"A Temporal Neural Network Model for Probabilistic Multi-Period Forecasting of Distributed Energy Resources","sourcePdf":"access-loschenbrand-3121988-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.110105S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"9312710","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","xplore-issue":"9312710","articleId":"9583253","onlineDate":"21 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":9583285,"authors":[{"name":"Fatih \u00dcnal","affiliation":["Firat University, Elaz\u0131\u01e7, Turkey"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/9312710/9583285/unal-3122009-small.gif","p":["Fatih \u00dcnal received the B.S. degree in energy systems engineering from the Faculty of Engineering, Osmaniye Korkut Ata University, Osmaniye, Turkey, in 2013, and the M.S. degree in energy systems engineering from Firat University, Elaz\u0131\u01e7, Turkey, in 2016.

Smart meters are controlled and manipulated through various interfaces in smart grids, such as cyber, physical and social interfaces. Recently, a large number of non-technical losses (NTLs) have been reported in smart grids worldwide. These are partially caused by false data injections (FDIs). Therefore, ensuring a secure communication medium and protected AMIs is critical to ensuring reliable power supply to consumers. In this paper, we propose a novel Big Data-driven solution that employs machine learning, deep learning and parallel computing techniques. We additionally obtained robust statistical features to detect the FDIs based cyber threats at the distribution level. The performance of the proposed model for NTL detection is investigated using private smart grid datasets in the Turkish distribution network for AMI-level cyber threats, and the results are compared to state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms used for NTL classification problems. Our approach shows promising results, as the accuracy, specificity, and precision metrics of most classifiers are above 90% and false positive rates vary between 0.005 to 0.027.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9583285/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 October 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9583285/","dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2021","publicationDate":"2021","volume":"9","isOpenAccess":true,"isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Big Data-Driven Detection of False Data Injection Attacks in Smart Meters","openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Big Data-Driven Detection of False Data Injection Attacks in Smart Meters","sourcePdf":"access-unal-3122009-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.11984S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"9312710","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","xplore-issue":"9312710","articleId":"9583285","onlineDate":"21 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-12-26"},{"_id":9583292,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaoyi Zhu","affiliation":["McGill University, Montreal, QC, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/9312710/9583292/zhu-3121750-small.gif","p":["Xiaoyi Zhu (Student Member, IEEE) received the B.Eng. degree in communication engineering from the Wuhan University of Technology, Wuhan, China, in 2018, and the M.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from McGill University, Montreal, QC, Canada, in 2020.

The proposed channel estimation technique generates group-wise channel state information (CSI) of user terminal (UT) zones in the service area by deep neural networks (DNN) and fuzzy c-Means (FCM) clustering. The slow time-varying CSI between the base station (BS) and feasible UT locations in the service area is calculated from the geospatial data by offline ray tracing and a DNN-based path estimation model associated with the 1-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D-CNN) and regression tree ensembles. Then, the UT-level CSI of all feasible locations is grouped into clusters by a proposed FCM clustering. Finally, the service area is divided into a number of non-overlapping UT zones. Each UT zone is characterized by a corresponding set of clusters named as UT-group CSI, which is utilized in the analog RF beamformer design of AB-HP to reduce the required large online CSI overhead in the MU-mMIMO systems. Then, the reduced-size online CSI is employed in the baseband (BB) precoder of AB-HP. Simulations are conducted in the indoor scenario at 28 GHz and tested in an AB-HP MU-mMIMO system with a uniform rectangular array (URA) having \n<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$16 \\times 16=256$ </tex-math></inline-formula>\n antennas and 22 RF chains. Illustrative results indicate that 91.4% online CSI can be reduced by using the proposed offline channel estimation technique as compared to the conventional online channel sounding. The proposed DNN-based path estimation technique produces same amount of UT-level CSI with runtime reduced by 65.8% as compared to the computationally expensive ray tracing. The imperfection of UT-level CSI introduced by the DNN-based path estimation technique is mitigated by the FCM clustering technique, where the AB-HP using offline UT-group CSI generated by the DNN-based channel estimation model and ray tracing based model for the RF beamformer achieves, respectively, 98.7% and 99.1% sum-rate performance of the fully digital precoding (FDP) technique using full-size online CSI.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Deep Learning and Geospatial Data-Based Channel Estimation Technique for Hybrid Massive MIMO Systems","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3121750","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/9312710/09583292.pdf","startPage":"145115","endPage":"145132","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3121750","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9312710","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9583292","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9583292/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 October 2021","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","displayDocTitle":"A Deep Learning and Geospatial Data-Based Channel Estimation Technique for Hybrid Massive MIMO Systems","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"9","htmlLink":"/document/9583292/","dateOfInsertion":"01 November 2021","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003816","fundingName":"Huawei Technologies Canada"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000038","fundingName":"Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"A Deep Learning and Geospatial Data-Based Channel Estimation Technique for Hybrid Massive MIMO Systems","sourcePdf":"access-koc-3121750-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.117658S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"9312710","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","xplore-issue":"9312710","articleId":"9583292","onlineDate":"21 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-11-06"},{"_id":9583583,"authors":[{"name":"Christian Herglotz","affiliation":["Chair of Multimedia Communications and Signal Processing, Friedrich-Alexander University Erlangen-N\u00fcrnberg, Erlangen, Germany"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/30/9660829/9583583/hergl-3122076-small.gif","p":["Christian Herglotz (Member, IEEE) received the Dipl.-Ing. degree in electrical engineering and information technology and the Dipl.-Wirt.

The components and the board can be made of heterogeneous material such as plastic, coated microchips, and metal bonds or wires, where a special coating for high emissivity is not required. The thermal images are recorded when the components on the board are dissipating power. In order to enable reliable estimates, a segmentation of the thermal image must be available that can be obtained by manual labeling, object detection methods, or exploiting layout information. Evaluations show that with low-resolution consumer infrared cameras and dissipated powers larger than 300 mW, mean estimation errors of 10% can be achieved.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9583583/","volume":"67","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/9583583/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2021","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2021","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 October 2021","displayDocTitle":"Component-Wise Power Estimation of Electrical Devices Using Thermal Imaging","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"FAU Emerging Talents Initiative"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Component-Wise Power Estimation of Electrical Devices Using Thermal Imaging","sourcePdf":"tce-herglotz-3122076-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.084534S","chronDate":"Nov.  2021","xplore-pub-id":"30","isNumber":"9660829","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"30","xplore-issue":"9660829","articleId":"9583583","onlineDate":"21 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-22"},{"_id":9583615,"authors":[{"name":"Jongseok Park","affiliation":["Intel Corporation, Hillsboro, OR, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/9583614/9583615/park-3115988-small.gif","p":["Jongseok Park (Member, IEEE) received the B.S. degree (Hons.) in electrical and electronic engineering from Yonsei University, Seoul, South Korea, in 2012, and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical and computer engineering from Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA, in 2016 and 2017, respectively.","He is currently with Intel Labs, Hillsboro, OR, USA.

The proposed SoC integrates a radio frequency (RF) pulse modulator for qubit state manipulation, a multi-tone signal generator and a coherent receiver for qubit state readout, and 22 DACs for high-speed voltage pulsing of qubit gates. By adopting frequency division multiplexing and direct digital synthesis (DDS), the RF pulse modulator can control up to 16 qubits over a single RF line, and the readout receiver can detect the state of up to six qubits simultaneously. The proposed SoC also integrates a microcontroller for low latency on-chip signal processing and increased flexibility in implementing quantum instruction sets. A detailed analysis of qubit-state readout fidelity and the impact of finite DAC resolution on two-qubit gate fidelity is also included in this article, together with an electrical specification summary. The SoC is implemented in Intel\u2019s 22 nm FFL fin field-effect transistor (FinFET) process, and it is characterized both at room and 4 K temperatures. The performance of each specific block is measured, with the readout characterized in a loop-back configuration. Generation of the control signals required for a full Rabi oscillation experiment is also demonstrated.

Our hypothesis is that like popular social media platforms DNMs also exhibit anomalous behaviour. However, we propose that the meaning of anomalies in DNMs differs from social media anomalies. The social media anomalies are a cause of threat to the real world, while DNM anomalies are caused by threats from the real world. We present an unsupervised learning method developed to detect anomalies. The model is based on a weighted sum of a feature set trained through an evolutionary algorithm. Our approach successfully identifies anomalies in 35 DNMs \u2013 both at the community level and at the level of its user types. Our analysis shows that most of the anomalies found align with well-known adverse events\u2013either as a direct consequence or as a cascading effect of the root event. Moreover, the model identified additional anomalies, which we were able to link to other events through post hoc analysis. Furthermore, we show that the adverse event of market shutdown generates a two-pronged impact on the ecosystem, i.e., it not only triggers startups of new markets but it does also inflict anomalies to current markets which may become fatal in some cases. We conclude that this two-pronged impact can be exploited by law enforcement agencies to produce maximum disruption in DNMs.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-10 Sept. 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9583702/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9583702/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2021","conferenceDate":"6-10 Sept. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"The Impact of Adverse Events in Darknet Markets: an Anomaly Detection Approach","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Impact of Adverse Events in Darknet Markets: an Anomaly Detection Approach","confLoc":"Vienna, Austria","sourcePdf":"999900a227.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.101224S","chronDate":"6-10 Sept. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9583613","isNumber":"9583677","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9583613","xplore-issue":"9583677","articleId":"9583702","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":9583711,"authors":[{"name":"Stefan Marksteiner","affiliation":["ITS Global Research & Technology, AVL List GmbH, Graz, Austria"],"firstName":"Stefan","lastName":"Marksteiner","id":"37086135217"},{"name":"Peter Priller","affiliation":["ITS Global Research & Technology, AVL List GmbH, Graz, Austria"],"firstName":"Peter","lastName":"Priller","id":"37085516778"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-1012-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-1013-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2768-0657"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2768-0649"}],"articleNumber":"9583711","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":29},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9583711","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Law","Supply chains","Manuals","Regulation","Iterative methods","Computer security","Vehicle dynamics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automobile industry","automotive components","automotive engineering","program testing","security of data","supply chain management","trees (mathematics)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["model-driven methodology","automotive cybersecurity test case generation","international regulations","latest UNECE regulation","automotive systems","higher efforts","cybersecurity engineering","manual cybersecurity testing techniques","automotive cybersecurity testing techniques","comprehensive testing","efficient testing","automotive life cycle","efficient third party testing","attack tree-based approach","automate automotive cybersecurity testing","automatically black box-deriving models","attack modeling"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cybersecurity","Automotive","Testing","Model-based Testing","Model-Learing","Test Automation","Security Testing","Automotive Testing"]}],"abstract":"Through international regulations (most prominently the latest UNECE regulation) and standards, the already widely perceived higher need for cybersecurity in automotive systems has been recognized and will mandate higher efforts for cybersecurity engineering. The UNECE also demands the effectiveness of these engineering to be verified and validated through testing. This requires both a significantly higher rate and more comprehensiveness of cybersecurity testing that is not effectively to cope with using current, predominantly manual, automotive cybersecurity testing techniques. To allow for comprehensive and efficient testing at all stages of the automotive life cycle, including supply chain parts not at hand, and to facilitate efficient third party testing, as well as to test under real-world conditions, also methodologies for testing the cybersecurity of vehicular systems as a black box are necessary. This paper therefore presents a model and attack tree-based approach to (semi-)automate automotive cybersecurity testing, as well as considerations for automatically black box-deriving models for the use in attack modeling.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9583677","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EuroSPW54576.2021.00021","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE European Symposium on Security and

For the non-cognitive case, the Cram\u00e9r-Rao bound (CRB) for target localization in FDA radar is derived and optimized with respect to the transmit signal parameters. It is shown that FDA transmission introduces coupling between range and direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation, and that the DOA estimation accuracy can be improved by increasing the signal bandwidth. Since the CRB ignores the threshold phenomenon, we propose to minimize it under a constraint which assures that the steered gain toward the target yields sufficiently large output signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). This method together with the FDA transmission properties establish the basis for developing the proposed cognitive FDA configuration, which is derived in the Bayesian approach. Based on the Bayesian CRB (BCRB) and the expected CRB (ECRB) for target localization, we propose a new criterion called the semi-ECRB (SECRB), and we prove that it is higher than the BCRB and lower than the ECRB. The SECRB is optimized with respect to the FDA signal parameters subject to mean SNR constraint. The target localization performances of the proposed methods in the non-cognitive and cognitive problems are analyzed via simulations and it is shown that they exhibit superior performance in terms of both threshold behavior and estimation accuracy, compared to other transmission methods.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Frequency Diverse Array Signal Optimization: From Non-Cognitive to Cognitive Radar","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2021.3122091","endPage":"6220","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/78/9307529/09583865.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","startPage":"6206","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2021.3122091","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9307529","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9583865","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radar","Location awareness","Optimization","Array signal processing","Signal to noise ratio","Estimation","Cognitive radar"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Adaptive beamforming","adaptive waveform design","Bayesian Cram\u00e9r-Rao bound (BCRB)","cognitive radar","cognitive target localization","Cram\u00e9r-Rao bound (CRB)","expected Cram\u00e9r-Rao bound (ECRB)","frequency diverse array (FDA)","semi-ECRB (SECRB)","waveform optimization"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Frequency Diverse Array Signal Optimization: From Non-Cognitive to Cognitive Radar","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9583865/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 October 2021","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","volume":"69","htmlLink":"/document/9583865/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"2021","dateOfInsertion":"02 December 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003977","fundingName":"Israel Science Foundation","grantNumber":"2666/19"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Frequency Diverse Array Signal Optimization: From Non-Cognitive to Cognitive Radar","sourcePdf":"tsp-tabrikian-3122091-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.085943S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"9307529","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","xplore-issue":"9307529","articleId":"9583865","onlineDate":"21 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-03"},{"_id":9583869,"authors":[{"name":"Xudong Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Stevens Institute of Technology, Hoboken, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Xudong","lastName":"Zhang","orcid":"0000-0001-5011-5306","id":"37086547446"},{"name":"Fangzhou Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Stevens Institute of Technology, Hoboken, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Fangzhou","lastName":"Wang","orcid":"0000-0002-9640-5285","id":"37086388219"},{"name":"Hongbin Li","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Stevens Institute of Technology, Hoboken, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Hongbin","lastName":"Li","orcid":"0000-0003-1453-847X","id":"37281093000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1070-9908"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2361"}],"articleNumber":"9583869","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":54},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Efficient Method for Cooperative Multi-Target Localization in Automotive Radar","abstract":"We consider the problem of locating multiple targets using automotive radar by exploiting a pair of cooperative vehicles, which form a mono- and bi-static sensing system to provide spatial diversity for localization. Each of the two sub-systems can measure the target echoes. The problem is to determine the locations of multiple targets in the surrounding area. A conventional approach is to directly estimate the target locations from the joint distribution of the mono- and bi-static observations, which is computationally prohibitive. In this paper, we propose a efficient two-step method that first uses the delay and angle estimates from each individual system to determine initial target locations, which are subsequently refined via an association and fusion step. Specifically, we use a 2-dimensional (2-D) fast Fourier transform (FFT) based approach to obtain the delay and angle estimates of each target in a sequential manner. The delay/angle estimates obtained by mono-static and bi-static systems lead to two sets of initial target location estimates, which are then sorted and paired via a minimum distance criterion. Finally, the initial location estimates are fused/weighted according to the target strength observed by each system. Simulation results show that our cooperative approach yields significant improved performance over non-cooperative approaches using only the mono-static or bi-static sensing system.","doi":"10.1109/LSP.2021.3121626","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LSP.2021.3121626","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9686799","startPage":"16","endPage":"20","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/97/9686799/09583869.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9583869","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sensors","Delays","Location awareness","Radar","Receiving antennas","Automotive engineering","Radar signal processing"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Mono-static sensing","bi-static sensing","multiple targets localization","delay and angle estimation","2-D FFT"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"An Efficient Method for Cooperative Multi-Target Localization in Automotive Radar","chronOrPublicationDate":"2022","isJournal":true,"volume":"29","publicationDate":"2022","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2022","htmlLink":"/document/9583869/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 October 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9583869/","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100008982","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"ECCS-1923739"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Efficient Method for Cooperative Multi-Target Localization in Automotive Radar","sourcePdf":"lsp-li-3121626-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.056331S","chronDate":"2022","xplore-pub-id":"97","isNumber":"9686799","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"97","xplore-issue":"9686799","articleId":"9583869","onlineDate":"21 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2022","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-25"},{"_id":9583892,"authors":[{"name":"Chaur-Heh Hsieh","affiliation":["College of Artificial Intelligence, Yango University, Fuzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/9312710/9583892/hsieh-3121093-small.gif","p":["Chaur-Heh Hsieh received the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from the Chung Cheng Institute of Technology (CCIT), Taiwan, China, in 1990.

To date, some of the fundamental problems in isolated writing have not been addressed effectively. This paper presents a simple yet effective air-writing recognition approach based on deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs). A robust and efficient hand tracking algorithm is proposed to extract air-writing trajectories collected by a single web camera. The algorithm addresses the push-to-write problem and avoids restrictions on the users\u2019 writing without using a delimiter and an imaginary box. A novel preprocessing scheme is also presented to convert the writing trajectory into appropriate forms of data, making the CNNs trained with these forms of data simpler and more effective.

Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are emerging to be an energy-efficient alternative to the traditional Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) which are known to be computationally intensive. From an application perspective, as federated learning involves multiple energy-constrained devices, there is a huge scope to leverage energy efficiency provided by SNNs. Despite its importance, there has been little attention on training SNNs on a large-scale distributed system like federated learning. In this paper, we bring SNNs to a more realistic federated learning scenario. Specifically, we design a federated learning method for training decentralized and privacy preserving SNNs. To validate the proposed method, we experimentally evaluate the advantages of SNNs on various aspects of federated learning with CIFAR10 and CIFAR100 benchmarks. We observe that SNNs outperform ANNs in terms of overall accuracy by over 15% when the data is distributed across a large number of clients in the federation while providing up to \n<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$4.3\\times$</tex-math></inline-formula>\n energy efficiency. In addition to efficiency, we also analyze the sensitivity of the proposed federated SNN framework to data distribution among the clients, stragglers, and gradient noise and perform a comprehensive comparison with ANNs.

However, near infrared (NIR) images captured by NIR sensors are robust to noise even in low light condition without color. Since RGB and NIR images are complementary in low light condition, the multispectral fusion of RGB and NIR images provides a viable solution to low light imaging. In this paper, we propose multispectral fusion of RGB and NIR images using weighted least squares (WLS) and convolution neural networks (CNNs). We combine traditional WLS filtering for layer decomposition and denoising with latest deep learning for image enhancement and texture transfer into the multispectral fusion to take both advantages. We build two networks based on CNN: image enhancement network (IEN) for image enhancement and texture transfer network (TTN) for NIR texture transfer. First, we perform RGB image denoising based on WLS filtering and generate the base layer. We use both RGB and NIR images for WLS filtering as weights to filter out noise in low light RGB images. Second, we conduct IEN to enhance contrast of the base layer. Third, we perform TTN to deliver NIR details completely and naturally to the fusion result. The combination of WLS, TTN and IEN leads to noise reduction, contrast enhancement, and detail preservation in fusion. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves good performance in both noise reduction and detail transfer as well as outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of visual quality and quantitative measurements.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9583922/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 October 2021","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"volume":"2","htmlLink":"/document/9583922/","publicationDate":"2021","dateOfInsertion":"13 November 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Multispectral Fusion of RGB and NIR Images Using Weighted Least Squares and Convolution Neural Networks","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61872280"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Multispectral Fusion of RGB and NIR Images Using Weighted Least Squares and Convolution Neural Networks","sourcePdf":"ojsp-jung-3122074-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.100716S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"8782710","isNumber":"9336068","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8782710","xplore-issue":"9336068","articleId":"9583922","onlineDate":"21 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":9583923,"authors":[{"name":"Pouria Nezhadmohammad","affiliation":["Amirkabir University of Technology, Tehran, Iran"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/9681827/9583923/nezha-3121035-small.gif","p":["Pouria Nezhadmohammad was born in Tehran, Iran, in 1993.

Under these restrictions, we formulated and analyzed the achievable rate and maximum departure regions in two well-studied scenarios, i.e., a classical PS-SWIPT MAC and a PS-SWIPT MAC with user cooperation. In the classical PS-SWIPT MAC setting, closed-form expressions for the optimal values of the PS factors are derived for two fundamental decoding schemes: simultaneous decoding and successive interference cancellation. In the PS-SWIPT MAC with user cooperation, the joint optimal power allocation for users as well as the optimal PS factor are derived. This reveals that one decoding scheme outperforms the other in the classical PS-SWIPT MAC, depending on the function type of the decoding cost. Finally, it is shown that the cooperation between users can potentially boost the performance of a PS-SWIPT MAC under decoding cost and non-linear EH constraints. Moreover, effects of the decoding cost functions, non-linear EH model and channel quality between the users are studied, and performance characteristics of the system are discussed.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2021.3121035","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/9681827/09583923.pdf","startPage":"306","endPage":"316","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9681827","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2021.3121035","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2022","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 October 2021","displayDocTitle":"SWIPT-Enabled Multiple Access Channel: Effects of Decoding Cost and Non-Linear EH Model","volume":"70","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/9583923/","dateOfInsertion":"14 January 2022","publicationDate":"Jan. 2022","isJournal":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9583923/","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002341","fundingName":"Academy of Finland","grantNumber":"334000"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SWIPT-Enabled Multiple Access Channel: Effects of Decoding Cost and Non-Linear EH Model","sourcePdf":"tcomm-emadi-3121035-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.134765S","chronDate":"Jan.  2022","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"9681827","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","xplore-issue":"9681827","articleId":"9583923","onlineDate":"21 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2022","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-23"},{"_id":9583931,"authors":[{"name":"Xiangke Zhang","affiliation":["College of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Shandong University of Technology, Zibo, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/9312710/9583931/zhang-3121072-small.gif","p":["Xiangke Zhang was born in Tai\u2019an, Shandong, China, in 1997.

Then, the aliasing IMFs are denoised by recursive least squares (RLS), and the denoised IMFs are superimposed with the effective IMFs to obtain the reconstructed signal. Finally, the dynamic fuzzy neural network (DFNN) is adjusted by the minimum output method to achieve the detection of the reconstructed residual current signal, and the network is used to predict the residual current according to the detection results. The detection results of the simulation and measured data show that the proposed algorithm has high detection accuracy and is superior to the wavelet neural network, empirical mode decomposition-thresholding, and wavelet entropy-auto encoder-back propagation neural network methods in terms of mean square error, goodness of fit and running time. This method provides a reference for further research on new adaptive residual current protection devices.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3121072","startPage":"142925","endPage":"142937","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/9312710/09583931.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3121072","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9312710","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Residual Current Detection Method Based on Variational Modal Decomposition and Dynamic Fuzzy Neural Network","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Biological neural networks","Fuzzy neural networks","Wavelet transforms","Fourier transforms","Entropy","Time-domain analysis","Licenses"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Adaptive signal processing","electrical fault detection","fuzzy neural networks","residual current","variational modal decomposition"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9583931/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 October 2021","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","displayDocTitle":"Residual Current Detection Method Based on Variational Modal Decomposition and Dynamic Fuzzy Neural Network","volume":"9","htmlLink":"/document/9583931/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"2021","dateOfInsertion":"26 October 2021","isOpenAccess":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100018629","fundingName":"Shandong University of Technology and the Zibo City Integration Development Project","grantNumber":"2019ZBXC011 and 2019ZBXC498"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Residual Current Detection Method Based on Variational Modal Decomposition and Dynamic Fuzzy Neural Network","sourcePdf":"access-zhang-3121072-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.097878S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"9312710","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","xplore-issue":"9312710","articleId":"9583931","onlineDate":"21 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":9583933,"authors":[{"name":"Arnab Shaw","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Wright State University, Dayton, OH, USA"],"firstName":"Arnab","lastName":"Shaw","orcid":"0000-0001-5183-7247"},{"name":"Jared Smith","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Wright State University, Dayton, OH, USA"],"firstName":"Jared","lastName":"Smith","orcid":"0000-0003-3093-3816"},{"name":"Aboulnasr Hassanien","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Wright State University, Dayton, OH, USA"],"firstName":"Aboulnasr","lastName":"Hassanien","orcid":"0000-0001-7636-1724"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1053-587X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0476"}],"articleNumber":"9583933","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":18},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9583933","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference","Array signal processing","Optimization","Covariance matrices","Maximum likelihood estimation","Signal to noise ratio","Signal processing algorithms"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Unit circle roots","capon","MVDR","beamforming","STAP","ULA"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TSP.2021.3121630","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/78/9307529/09583933.pdf","startPage":"6116","endPage":"6130","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2021.3121630","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9307529","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MVDR Beamformer Design by Imposing Unit Circle Roots Constraints for Uniform Linear Arrays","abstract":"A 2004 paper had offered a theoretical proof that ideally the roots of the minimum variance distortionless response (MVDR) beamformer array polynomial lie on the unit circle (UC).

UCRC-MVDR is computationally efficient and parallelizable as all roots can be optimized concurrently. In extensive simulation studies, UCRC-MVDR exhibits consistently superior performance over existing MVDR approaches, and its performance is closer to the ideal clairvoyant case than existing MVDR methods.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9583933/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 October 2021","volume":"69","publicationDate":"2021","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2021","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"MVDR Beamformer Design by Imposing Unit Circle Roots Constraints for Uniform Linear Arrays","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Center for Surveillance Research"},{"fundingName":"NSF IUCRC","grantNumber":"IIP-1539960"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MVDR Beamformer Design by Imposing Unit Circle Roots Constraints for Uniform Linear Arrays","sourcePdf":"tsp-smith-3121630-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.023792S","chronDate":"2021","isNumber":"9307529","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","articleId":"9583933","onlineDate":"21 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-15"},{"_id":9583952,"authors":[{"name":"Jun Hu","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of ASIC and System, Fudan University, Shanghai, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/9312710/9583952/hu-3120992-small.gif","p":["Jun Hu (Graduate Student Member, IEEE) received the B.S. degree in microelectronics from Anhui University, Hefei, China, in 2015, and the M.S. degree in microelectronics and solid-state electronics from the Institute of Microelectronics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China, in 2018.

A complete mathematical model is presented for a converter and its control. The system under study is a small microgrid comprising an AC grid that is feeding a DC load through a converter. The converter is connected to the AC grid through RL filter. On the DC side an energy storage system ESS is connected to the DC bus. Classical linear controllers have limitations due to their slow transient performance and low robustness against parameter variations and load disturbances. In this paper, a machine learned controllers are used to deal with those drawbacks of the traditional controller. First, a study for conventional nested loop Proportional Integral for both outer and inner loops PI-PI controller is introduced. Then, a Data Driven Online Learning (DDOL) controller is proposed. This controller is a Proportional Integral Neural Network (PINN) that is used to enhance the system performance in terms of dynamic and steady-state responses. A comparison between the normal traditional PI-PI controller and the proposed DDOL ones is made under different operating scenarios. The converter control is tested under different operational conditions, and its dynamic and steady-state behavior is analyzed. The model is done through a MATLAB Simulink to check the normal operation of the network in a grid-connected mode under different load disturbances and AC input voltage. The results are showing that the intelligent controller can achieve the set reference points with better performance in terms of both dynamic and steady-state responses.","doi":"10.1109/EEEIC/ICPSEurope51590.2021.9584502","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EEEIC/ICPSEurope51590.2021.9584502","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Conference on Environment and Electrical Engineering and 2021 IEEE Industrial and Commercial Power Systems Europe (EEEIC / I&CPS Europe)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9584464/9584465/09584502.pdf","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Conference on Environment and Electrical Engineering and 2021 IEEE Industrial and Commercial Power Systems Europe (EEEIC / I&CPS Europe)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9584465","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Data-Driven Based Online Learning Control of Voltage Source Converter for DC Microgrids","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Sept. 2021","displayDocTitle":"A Data-Driven Based Online Learning Control of Voltage Source Converter for DC Microgrids","conferenceDate":"7-10 Sept. 2021","publicationDate":"7 Sept. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"13 November 2021","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9584502/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9584502/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Data-Driven Based Online Learning Control of Voltage Source Converter for DC Microgrids","confLoc":"Bari, Italy","sourcePdf":"295.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054578S","chronDate":"7-10 Sept. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9584464","isNumber":"9584465","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9584464","xplore-issue":"9584465","articleId":"9584502","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-26"},{"_id":9584512,"authors":[{"name":"Maciej Klimas","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Silesian University of Technology, Gliwice, Poland"],"firstName":"Maciej","lastName":"Klimas","id":"37086483534"},{"name":"Dariusz Grabowski","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Silesian University of Technology, Gliwice, Poland"],"firstName":"Dariusz","lastName":"Grabowski","id":"38017720000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3613-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-6654-3612-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3614-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9584512","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":16},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Deep learning","Analytical models","Furnaces","Stochastic processes","Differential equations","Artificial neural networks","Mathematical models"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["electric arc furnace","neural network","multilayer perceptron","nonlinear autoregressive exogenous model","Hammerstein-Wiener model"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9584512","abstract":"Electric arc furnaces (EAFs) are important appliances in steelmaking industry, but they are characterized by nonlinear, dynamic and stochastic nature.

Therefore, it is necessary to have accurate models of EAFs, reflecting the complicated character of such loads. Researchers use different approaches for EAF modelling, such as stochastic processes analysis, differential equation models or neural networks. This paper presents the application of three artificial neural network (ANN) based models in EAF modelling. The goal was to provide ANN models which are simple in structure in comparison to deep learning methods used by other researchers. First two models are built on multilayer perceptron networks and the third applies a nonlinear autoregressive exogenous model with the help of a differential equation transformed into Hammerstein-Wiener model.

An early detection system is necessary to prevent fires from spreading out of control. In this paper, we propose a multistage fire detection method using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and long short-term memory (LSTM) networks. In the first stage, fire candidates are detected by using their salient features, such as their color, flickering frequency, and brightness. In the second stage, a pretrained CNN model is used to extract the 2D features of flames that are the input for the LSTM network. In the last stage, a softmax classifier is utilized to determine whether the flames represent a true fire or a nonfire moving object. The experimental results show that our proposed method can achieve competitive performance compared with other state-of-the-art methods and is suitable for real-world applications.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3122346","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3122346","startPage":"146667","endPage":"146679","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/9312710/09584840.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9312710","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multistage Real-Time Fire Detection Using Convolutional Neural Networks and Long Short-Term Memory Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 October 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","displayDocTitle":"Multistage Real-Time Fire Detection Using Convolutional Neural Networks and Long Short-Term Memory Networks","publicationDate":"2021","dateOfInsertion":"13 November 2021","volume":"9","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9584840/","isOpenAccess":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9584840/","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003725","fundingName":"Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) funded by the Ministry of Education","grantNumber":"NRF2018R1D1A1B07049146"},{"fundingName":"Vingroup Joint Stock Company and by the Domestic Master/Ph.D. Scholarship Programme of Vingroup Innovation Foundation (VINIF), Vingroup Big Data Institute (VINBIGDATA)","grantNumber":"VINIF.2020.TS.103"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Multistage Real-Time Fire Detection Using Convolutional Neural Networks and Long Short-Term Memory Networks","sourcePdf":"access-vu-3122346-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.102645S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"9312710","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","xplore-issue":"9312710","articleId":"9584840","onlineDate":"22 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-12-26"},{"_id":9584849,"authors":[{"name":"Alyaa Amer","affiliation":["University of Lincoln, Lincoln, U.K.","Computer Science College, Arab Academy for Science, Technology & Maritime Transport, Cairo, Egypt"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/9312710/9584849/amer-3122256-small.gif","p":["Alyaa Amer is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree in computer science with the Department of Computer Science, University of Lincoln, U.K. She is also a Teaching Assistant with the Computer Engineering Department, Arab Academy for Science, Technology & Maritime Transport, Alexandria, Egypt.

However, the fuzzy nature of echocardiographic images degraded by distortion and speckle noise poses some challenges on the manual segmentation task. In this paper, we propose a fully automated left ventricle segmentation method that can overcome those challenges. Our method performs accurate delineation for the ventricle boundaries despite the ill-defined borders and shape variability of the left ventricle. The well-known deep learning segmentation model, known as the U-net, has addressed some of these challenges with outstanding performance. However, it still ignores the contribution of all semantic information through the segmentation process. Here we propose a novel deep learning segmentation method based on U-net, named ResDUnet. It incorporates feature extraction at different scales through the integration of cascaded dilated convolution. To ease the training process, residual blocks are deployed instead of the basic U-net blocks. Each residual block is enriched with a squeeze and excitation unit for channel-wise attention and adaptive feature re-calibration. The performance of the method is evaluated on a dataset of 2000 images acquired from 500 patients with large variability in quality and patient pathology. ResDUnet outperforms state-of-the-art methods with a Dice similarity increase of 8.4% and 1.2% compared to deeplabv3 and U-net, respectively. Furthermore, to demonstrate the impact of each proposed sub-module, several experiments have been carried out with different designs and variations of the integrated sub-modules. We also describe and discuss all technical elements of a deep-learning model via a step-by-step explanation of parameters and methods, while using our left ventricle segmentation as a case study, to explain the application of AI to echocardiographic imaging.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9584849/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 October 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9584849/","dateOfInsertion":"09 December 2021","publicationDate":"2021","volume":"9","isOpenAccess":true,"isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"ResDUnet: A Deep Learning-Based Left Ventricle Segmentation Method for Echocardiography","openAccessFlag":"T","title":"ResDUnet: A Deep Learning-Based Left Ventricle Segmentation Method for Echocardiography","sourcePdf":"access-amer-3122256-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.070731S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"9312710","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","xplore-issue":"9312710","articleId":"9584849","onlineDate":"22 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-12-26"},{"_id":9584850,"authors":[{"name":"Quang Vinh Do","affiliation":["Artificial Intelligence Research Center, Pusan National University, Busan, South Korea"],"firstName":"Quang Vinh","lastName":"Do","orcid":"0000-0002-6899-2347"},{"name":"Quoc-Viet Pham","affiliation":["Korean Southeast Center for the 4th Industrial Revolution Leader Education, Pusan National University, Busan, South Korea"],"firstName":"Quoc-Viet","lastName":"Pham","orcid":"0000-0002-9485-9216"},{"name":"Won-Joo Hwang","affiliation":["Pusan National University, Gyeongsangnam, South Korea"],"firstName":"Won-Joo","lastName":"Hwang","orcid":"0000-0001-8398-564X"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"9584850","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":209},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9584850","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Unmanned aerial vehicles","Training","Energy consumption","Task analysis","Batteries","Bandwidth","Optimization"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Deep reinforcement learning","energy harvesting","federated learning","resource allocation","unmanned aerial vehicle"]}],"abstract":"Federated learning (FL) is a promising solution to privacy preservation for data-driven deep learning approaches.

We aim to maximize the long-term FL performance considering the limited resources in the network, such as harvested energy, bandwidth resources, and UAV\u2019s energy budget. To reduce the complexity of the original problem, we leverage the Lyapunov optimization technique to transform a long-term energy constraint into a deterministic problem. We reformulate the optimization problem as the framework of a Markov decision process (MDP) and design a DRL-based algorithm to solve the MDP.

In this paper, a novel deep learning model is proposed based on different Convolution Neural Networks (CNN) and the attention mechanism for addressing the HAR problem by using sensory data from accelerometers and gyroscopes and providing high recognition accuracy. The architecture of the proposed model (named LGSTNet) is designed to be able to analyse and extract Local and Global Spatial-Temporal features from sensory data for HAR. The idea of LGSTNet is to segment an activity window into several sub-windows and join the Attention mechanism into an 2D CNN (named Attention-based 2D-CNN module) to precisely learn local spatial-temporal features from those sub-windows. Meanwhile, an 3D CNN (named 3D-CNN module) is designed to learn global spatial-temporal features from the whole window.

In our proposed method, single-rate virtual reference feedback tuning (S-VRFT), where the holding interval is the same as the sampling interval, is extended to the dual-rate virtual reference feedback tuning (D-VRFT) system. In D-VRFT, a controller is decided using a set of input/output data used in S-VRFT, and it is easy to extend S-VRFT to D-VRFT and implement D-VRFT.

In our proposed method, single-rate virtual reference feedback tuning (S-VRFT), where the holding interval is the same as the sampling interval, is extended to the dual-rate virtual reference feedback tuning (D-VRFT) system. In D-VRFT, a controller is decided using a set of input/output data used in S-VRFT, and it is easy to extend S-VRFT to D-VRFT and implement D-VRFT.

However, the high false alarm rate (FAR) of conventional BIT leads to troubles for manufacturers and users. To solve this problem, a novel BIT analog signal recognition algorithm that integrates long short-term memory (LSTM) and biologically inspired neural network (BINN) is proposed in this article. The effects of signal noise and intermittent faults on BIT results are effectively reduced. The proposed algorithm is mainly used for the BIT analog signal of heavy-duty gas turbine controllers, LSTM is used for preliminary modeling of analog signals, and the BINN is introduced into the extra signal state recognition, serving as a classifier based on stimulation transmission among neurons. Furthermore, the gravitational search algorithm (GSA) is employed to optimize the parameters of the proposed algorithm to improve its performance. By employing BIT temperature signal data from heavy-duty gas turbine controllers, extensive experimental results were given to show that the proposed approach was reasonable and accurate by comparison with conventional BIT. By comparing with other common neural network algorithms, the developed approach can provide lower FAR and more accurate recognition results.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Signal processing algorithms","Turbines","Time series analysis","Heuristic algorithms","Signal processing","Neural networks","Power systems"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Analog signal recognition","biologically inspired neural network (BINN)","built-in test (BIT)","gravitational search algorithm (GSA)","long short-term memory (LSTM)"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9259274","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIM.2021.3122200","startPage":"1","endPage":"11","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","pdfPath":"/iel7/19/9259274/09584872.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TIM.2021.3122200","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An LSTM-BINN Approach for Built-In Test Analog Signal State Recognition of Heavy-Duty Gas Turbine Controllers","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 October 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"An LSTM-BINN Approach for Built-In Test Analog Signal State Recognition of Heavy-Duty Gas Turbine Controllers","publicationDate":"2021","volume":"70","dateOfInsertion":"13 November 2021","externalId":"2516611","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9584872/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9584872/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100013076","fundingName":"National Science and Technology Major Project of China","grantNumber":"2017-V-0010-0061"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An LSTM-BINN Approach for Built-In Test Analog Signal State Recognition of Heavy-Duty Gas Turbine Controllers","sourcePdf":"tim-huang-3122200-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.091224S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"19","isNumber":"9259274","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"19","xplore-issue":"9259274","articleId":"9584872","onlineDate":"22 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-10"},{"_id":9584875,"authors":[{"name":"Suihua Cai","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Engineering and the Guangdong Key Laboratory of Information Security Technology, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China"],"bio":{"p":["Suihua Cai (Member, IEEE) received the B.Sc. degree in information and computing science from the China University of Geosciences, Wuhan, China, in 2011, and the M.S. degree in fundamental mathematics and the Ph.D. degree in information and communication engineering from Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China, in 2016 and 2019, respectively.

This is possible since a gap to the channel capacity typically exists for a practical code. A new concept, termed as \n<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">accessible capacity</i>\n, is introduced to specify the maximum rate at which the superposition transmission of extra bits is reliable and has a negligible effect on the performance of the coded payload link. For a binary-input output-symmetric (BIOS) memoryless channel, the accessible capacity can be characterized as the difference between the channel capacity and the mutual information rate of the coded payload link, which can be numerically evaluated for very short payload codes. For a general payload code, we present a simple lower bound on the accessible capacity, given by the channel capacity minus the coding rate of the payload code. We then focus on the scenarios where low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes are implemented for the payload link. We propose to transmit extra bits by random superposition for encoding, and exhaustive search (with the aid of statistical learning) for decoding. We further propose, by establishing an auxiliary channel (called \n<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">syndrome channel</i>\n) induced from \u201czero-forcing\u201d over the binary field, to transmit extra bits with structured codes such as repetition codes and first-order Reed-Muller (RM) codes. Numerical results show that up to 60 extra bits can be reliably transmitted along with a rate-1/2 LDPC code of length 8064.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Payloads","Encoding","Parity check codes","Decoding","Bandwidth","Reliability","Memoryless systems"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Accessible capacity","free-ride codes","LDPC codes","superposition coding","superposition transmission","transmission of extra bits"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9660615","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2021.3122342","startPage":"80","endPage":"92","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel7/18/9660615/09584875.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2021.3122342","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Free Ride on LDPC Coded Transmission","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 October 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Free Ride on LDPC Coded Transmission","publicationDate":"Jan. 2022","volume":"68","issue":"1","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2021","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9584875/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9584875/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2022","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61971454, 61871201 and 61771499"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100020084","fundingName":"Basic Research Program of Guangzhou Municipal Science and Technology Bureau","grantNumber":"202102020872"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Free Ride on LDPC Coded Transmission","sourcePdf":"tit-ma-3122342-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.069931S","chronDate":"Jan.  2022","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"9660615","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","xplore-issue":"9660615","articleId":"9584875","onlineDate":"22 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2022","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-22"},{"_id":9584900,"authors":[{"name":"Samad Khabbazi Oskouei","affiliation":["Islamic Azad University, Varamin-Pishva Branch, Varamin, Iran"],"bio":{"p":["Samad Khabbazi Oskouei received the B.S. degree in mathematics from the University of Tabriz, Tabriz, Iran, in 2000, the M.S. degree in mathematics from the University of Tehran, Tehran, Iran, in 2002, and the Ph.D. degree in mathematics from the University of Tehran, jointly with the ICTP, Trieste, Italy, in 2015, under the STEP Program.

Here we investigate the information transmission capabilities in this framework by considering Gaussian unitaries acting on Bosonic systems. We consider both quantum communication and classical communication with helper, as well as classical communication with free classical coordination between sender and helper (conferencing encoders). Concerning quantum communication, we prove general coding theorems with and without energy constraints, yielding multi-letter (regularized) expressions. In the search for cases where the capacity formula is computable, we look for Gaussian unitaries that are universally degradable or anti-degradable. However, we show that no Gaussian unitary yields either a degradable or anti-degradable channel for all environment states. On the other hand, restricting to Gaussian environment states, results in universally degradable unitaries, for which we thus can give single-letter quantum capacity formulas. Concerning classical communication, we prove a general coding theorem for the classical capacity under an energy constraint, given by a multi-letter expression. Furthermore, we derive an uncertainty-type relation between the classical capacities of the sender and the helper, helped respectively by the other party, showing a lower bound on the sum of the two capacities. Then, this is used to lower bound the classical information transmission rate in the scenario of classical communication between sender and helper.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 October 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9584900/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2022","volume":"68","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2022","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9584900/","displayDocTitle":"Capacities of Gaussian Quantum Channels With Passive Environment Assistance","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000780","fundingName":"Horizon-2020 Programme of the European Commission through the Future and Emerging Technologies (FET)-Open Grant Agreement QUAntum Readout TEchniques and Technologies (QUARTET)","grantNumber":"862644"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003329","fundingName":"Spanish Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad (MINECO)","grantNumber":"FIS2016-86681-P and PID2019-107609GB-I00/AEI/10.13039/501100011033"},{"fundingName":"Fondo Europeo de Desarrollo Regional (FEDER) Funds"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002809","fundingName":"Generalitat de Catalunya","grantNumber":"2017-SGR-1127"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Capacities of Gaussian Quantum Channels With Passive Environment Assistance","sourcePdf":"tit-oskouei-3122150-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.123302S","chronDate":"Jan.  2022","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"9660615","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","xplore-issue":"9660615","articleId":"9584900","onlineDate":"22 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2022","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-22"},{"_id":9584904,"authors":[{"name":"Da Chen","affiliation":["Research Center of 6G Mobile Communications, School of Cyber Science and Engineering, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/9681827/9584904/chen-3122193-small.gif","p":["Da Chen (Member, IEEE) received the B.S. and Ph.D. degrees from the Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China, in 2009 and 2015, respectively.

Finally, the symbol error rate (SER), average signal transmit power, computational overhead and power spectral density (PSD) are analyzed.

In this letter, leveraging martingale theory and stochastic network calculus, we construct an analysis framework of the reliability regard to E2E latency for the multi-hop system, where nodes provide heterogeneous services. A martingale parameter, called as tandem service descriptor, is proposed to measure the service ability of nodes, which embodies the features of tandem service mode supplied for the specific E2E flow. The bandwidth abstraction algorithm is designed, which decouples the E2E latency-bounded reliability requirement as the demanded bandwidth of each node. Subject to the abstracted bandwidth, slice instantiation strategies are performed for the access network and core network respectively. The transmission power is allocated dynamically according to the access states and channel characteristics. In the core network nodes, the service rates that the arrival traffic requires are determined. Simulation results verify the effectiveness of the slice customization scheme.","doi":"10.1109/LCOMM.2021.3122305","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCOMM.2021.3122305","startPage":"217","endPage":"221","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/4234/9674048/09584912.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9674048","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Martingale-Based Bandwidth Abstraction and Slice Instantiation Under the End-to-End Latency-Bounded Reliability Constraint","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 October 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2022","displayDocTitle":"Martingale-Based Bandwidth Abstraction and Slice Instantiation Under the End-to-End Latency-Bounded Reliability Constraint","publicationDate":"Jan. 2022","dateOfInsertion":"07 January 2022","volume":"26","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9584912/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9584912/","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61801191"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100013061","fundingName":"Jilin Scientific and Technological Development Program","grantNumber":"20200401147GX"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Martingale-Based Bandwidth Abstraction and Slice Instantiation Under the End-to-End Latency-Bounded Reliability Constraint","sourcePdf":"lcomm-chi-3122305-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.090691S","chronDate":"Jan.  2022","xplore-pub-id":"4234","isNumber":"9674048","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4234","xplore-issue":"9674048","articleId":"9584912","onlineDate":"22 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2022","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-10"},{"_id":9584916,"authors":[{"name":"Onur G\u00fcnl\u00fc","affiliation":["Chair of Communications Engineering and Security, University of Siegen, Siegen, Germany"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/9681827/9584916/gunlu-3122201-small.gif","p":["Onur G\u00fcnl\u00fc (Member, IEEE) received the B.Sc. degree (High Hons.) in electrical and electronics engineering from Bilkent University, Turkey, in 2011, and the M.Sc.

Polar subcodes (PSCs) are polar codes (PCs) with dynamically-frozen symbols and have a larger code minimum distance than PCs with only statically-frozen symbols. A randomized nested PSC construction, where the low-rate code is a PSC and the high-rate code is a PC, is proposed for successive cancellation list (SCL) and sequential decoders. This code construction aims to perform lossy compression with side information, i.e., Wyner-Ziv (WZ) coding. Nested PSCs are used in the key agreement problem with physical identifiers and two terminals since WZ-coding constructions significantly improve on Slepian-Wolf coding constructions such as fuzzy extractors. Significant gains in terms of the secret-key vs. storage rate ratio as compared to nested PCs with the same list sizes are illustrated to show that nested PSCs significantly improve on all existing code constructions. The performance of the nested PSCs is shown to improve with larger list sizes, unlike the nested PCs considered. A design procedure to efficiently construct nested PSCs and possible improvements to the nested PSC designs are also provided.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2021.3122201","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/9681827/09584916.pdf","startPage":"514","endPage":"525","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9681827","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2021.3122201","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2022","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 October 2021","displayDocTitle":"Privacy, Secrecy, and Storage With Nested Randomized Polar Subcode Constructions","volume":"70","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/9584916/","dateOfInsertion":"14 January 2022","publicationDate":"Jan. 2022","isJournal":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9584916/","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002347","fundingName":"German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) within the national initiative for Post Shannon Communication (NewCom)","grantNumber":"16KIS1004"},{"fundingName":"Government of Russian Federation","grantNumber":"08-08"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100010663","fundingName":"European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union\u2019s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme","grantNumber":"801434"},{"fundingName":"Institute of Communications Engineering at TU Munich"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Privacy, Secrecy, and Storage With Nested Randomized Polar Subcode Constructions","sourcePdf":"tcomm-gunlu-3122201-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.110825S","chronDate":"Jan.  2022","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"9681827","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","xplore-issue":"9681827","articleId":"9584916","onlineDate":"22 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2022","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-23"},{"_id":9584921,"authors":[{"name":"Kwadwo Boateng Ofori-Amanfo","affiliation":["Hanbat National University, Daejeon, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/9312710/9584921/ofori-3122375-small.gif","p":["Kwadwo Boateng Ofori-Amanfo (Member, IEEE) received the B.Sc. and M.Phil. degrees in computer engineering from the University of Ghana (UG), Ghana, in 2010 and 2014, respectively.

Communication between a source node and a destination node is aided via multi-hop relays with simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT). We investigate the separate application of both power splitting (PS) and time splitting (TS) based SWIPT relaying protocols in our system model. The performances of the two are then compared and analyzed. The SWIPT protocol enables the current relay to harvest energy from the immediately preceding relay node, to reliably forward the information signals between the source and the destination. We aim to minimize the transmit power at the source under the end-to-end system throughput constraint by optimizing either PS or TS ratios at each relay node. For that, the global solutions for the ratios of either PS or TS are attained via convex optimization techniques. A closed-form solution was reached for the SWIPT PS approach. However, the SWIPT TS approach is achieved via an iterative algorithm. Also, we propose a simple routing algorithm based on Dijkstra\u2019s algorithm for our proposed DF-SWIPT multi-hop system. Finally, we compare the proposed PS and TS ratio schemes to their corresponding fixed PS and TS ratio schemes, in terms of source power resource consumption, computational complexity, and overhead analysis. It is found that the PS outperforms the TS, owing to the higher computationally demands of the TS.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-Hop MIMO Relaying Based on Simultaneous Wireless Information and Power Transfer","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3122375","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/9312710/09584921.pdf","startPage":"144857","endPage":"144870","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3122375","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9312710","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9584921","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9584921/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 October 2021","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","displayDocTitle":"Multi-Hop MIMO Relaying Based on Simultaneous Wireless Information and Power Transfer","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"9","htmlLink":"/document/9584921/","dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2021","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003725","fundingName":"National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) Grant through the Korean Government (MSIT)","grantNumber":"NRF-2019R1A2C4070361"},{"fundingName":"Institute of Information & Communications Technology Planning & Evaluation (IITP) Grant through the Korean Government (MSIT)","grantNumber":"2018-0-00812 (IoT Wireless Powered Cognitive Radio Communications With User-Centric Distributed Massive MIMO Systems)"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Multi-Hop MIMO Relaying Based on Simultaneous Wireless Information and Power Transfer","sourcePdf":"access-oforiamanfo-3122375-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.130214S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"9312710","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","xplore-issue":"9312710","articleId":"9584921","onlineDate":"22 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-11-06"},{"_id":9584998,"authors":[{"name":"Christian Tschoban","affiliation":["Fraunhofer IZM Berlin Gustav-Meyer-Allee 25, Berlin"],"firstName":"Christian","lastName":"Tschoban","id":"37593448300"},{"name":"Seyyid Dilek","affiliation":["Fraunhofer IZM Berlin Gustav-Meyer-Allee 25, Berlin"],"firstName":"Seyyid","lastName":"Dilek","id":"37086066700"},{"name":"Ivan Ndip","affiliation":["Fraunhofer IZM Berlin Gustav-Meyer-Allee 25, Berlin"],"firstName":"Ivan","lastName":"Ndip","id":"37303228300"},{"name":"Harald P\u00f6tter","affiliation":["Fraunhofer IZM Berlin Gustav-Meyer-Allee 25, Berlin"],"firstName":"Harald","lastName":"P\u00f6tter","id":"37331872400"},{"name":"Klaus-Dieter Lang","affiliation":["Fraunhofer IZM Berlin Gustav-Meyer-Allee 25, Berlin"],"firstName":"Klaus-Dieter","lastName":"Lang","id":"37085451354"},{"name":"Martin Schneider-Ramelow","affiliation":["Fraunhofer IZM Berlin Gustav-Meyer-Allee 25, Berlin","TU-Berlin, StraBe des 17.

The multi-granular land use for multi-source remotely sensed image categories is now a principal task in remote sensing data augmentation and data selection. Understanding image representations are meaningful for the scene classification task. Training deep learning model-based approaches has to do with scene classification and brings about fantastic achievement. At the same time, these high-level approaches are computationally expensive and time\u2013consuming. This paper introduces multi-granularity Neural Network Encoding architecture base on InceptionV3, InceptionReseNetV2, VGG16, and DenseNet201 architecture into remote sensing scene classification. To improve performance and to solve intra-class variation for multi-class scene issues remote sensing dataset. By using pre-trained CNN, activation function and ensemble learning have been adopting. InceptionV3 and VGG16 are used to extract features. InceptionResNetV2 use for fine-tuning, which consists of unfreezing the entre model and retraining the new data with a lower learning rate. The proposed fine-tune whole pre-trained model produces better results of test set up to 97.84 % than features extracted by InceptionResNetV2. Also, we use DCNNs ensemble average and weighted average to achieve better outcomes for 97.36% and 99.10%. In our experiments, we attempted to fine-tune the deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) training method for remote sensing scene classification on two public datasets UCM, SIRI-WHU, and one dataset I collected through the google earth engine from East Africa Community Countries (EACC) within nine classes within total 2112 labeled images. The results indicate that our proposed fine-tuning of the pre-trained model with few epochs and less computational time increases accuracy.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3122569","startPage":"146703","endPage":"146718","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/9312710/09585087.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3122569","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9312710","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Learning Multi-Granularity Neural Network Encoding Image Classification Using DCNNs for Easter Africa Community Countries","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Feature extraction","Remote sensing","Convolutional neural networks","Task analysis","Image segmentation","Neural networks","Sensors"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Convolutional neural networks (CNNs)","fine-tuning","granularity feature extraction","machine learning","and remote sensing (RS)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9585087/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 October 2021","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","displayDocTitle":"Learning Multi-Granularity Neural Network Encoding Image Classification Using DCNNs for Easter Africa Community Countries","volume":"9","htmlLink":"/document/9585087/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"2021","dateOfInsertion":"13 November 2021","isOpenAccess":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61772096"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100005230","fundingName":"Foundation for Innovative Research Groups of Natural Science Foundation of Chongqing","grantNumber":"cstc2019jcyj-cxttX0002"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Learning Multi-Granularity Neural Network Encoding Image Classification Using DCNNs for Easter Africa Community Countries","sourcePdf":"access-jeanbosco-3122569-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.178884S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"9312710","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","xplore-issue":"9312710","articleId":"9585087","onlineDate":"25 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":9585093,"authors":[{"name":"Antonio Bazco-Nogueras","affiliation":["Mitsubishi Electric Research and Development Centre Europe, Rennes, France","EURECOM, Sophia-Antipolis, France","IMDEA Networks Institute, Madrid, Spain"],"bio":{"p":["Antonio Bazco-Nogueras (Member, IEEE) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in telecommunications engineering from the University of Zaragoza, Spain, in 2014 and 2016, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree from Sorbonne Universit\u00e9, Paris, France, in collaboration with the Mitsubishi Electric Research and Development Centre Europe, Rennes, France, in 2019.

It has been recently shown that, for some regimes, this setting attains the same Degrees-of-Freedom as the ideal centralized setting with perfect Channel State Information (CSI) sharing, in which all the transmitters are endowed with the best estimate available at any transmitter. This result is restricted by the limitations of the Degrees-of-Freedom metric, as it only provides information about the slope of growth of the capacity as a function of the SNR, without any insight about the possible performance at a given SNR. In order to overcome this limitation, we analyze the affine approximation of the rate on the high-SNR regime for this decentralized Network MISO setting for the antenna configurations in which it achieves the Degrees-of-Freedom of the centralized setting. We show that, for a regime of antenna configurations, it is possible to asymptotically attain the same achievable rate as in the ideal centralized scenario. Consequently, it is possible to achieve the beamforming gain of the ideal perfect-CSI-sharing setting even if only a subset of transmitters is endowed with precise CSI, which can be exploited in scenarios such as distributed massive MIMO where the number of transmit antennas is much bigger than the number of served users. This outcome is a consequence of the synergistic compromise between CSI precision at the transmitters and consistency between the locally-computed precoders, which is an inherent trade-off of decentralized settings that does not exist in the centralized CSI configuration. We propose a precoding scheme achieving the previous result, which is built on an uneven structure in which some transmitters reduce the precision of their own precoding vector for the sake of using transmission parameters that can be more easily predicted by the other transmitters.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Signal to noise ratio","MISO communication","Precoding","Measurement","Radio transmitters","Europe","Wireless networks"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Network MIMO","cooperative transmission","distributed broadcast channel","decentralized zero-forcing"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9660615","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2021.3121752","startPage":"248","endPage":"271","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel7/18/9660615/09585093.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2021.3121752","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Asymptotically Achieving Centralized Rate on the Decentralized Network MISO Channel","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 October 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Asymptotically Achieving Centralized Rate on the Decentralized Network MISO Channel","publicationDate":"Jan. 2022","volume":"68","issue":"1","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2021","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9585093/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9585093/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2022","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100010663","fundingName":"European Research Council through the European Union\u2019s Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Program","grantNumber":"670896"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Asymptotically Achieving Centralized Rate on the Decentralized Network MISO Channel","sourcePdf":"tit-bazconogueras-3121752-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.133047S","chronDate":"Jan.  2022","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"9660615","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","xplore-issue":"9660615","articleId":"9585093","onlineDate":"25 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2022","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-22"},{"_id":9585102,"authors":[{"name":"Liang Yang","affiliation":["College of Information Science and Engineering, Hunan University, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Liang","lastName":"Yang","orcid":"0000-0002-6576-332X"},{"name":"Pinhui Li","affiliation":["College of Information Science and Engineering, Hunan University, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Pinhui","lastName":"Li","orcid":"0000-0002-8801-5076"},{"name":"Yin Yang","affiliation":["College of Information Science and Engineering, Hunan University, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Yin","lastName":"Yang","orcid":"0000-0001-9607-1177"},{"name":"Sai Li","affiliation":["College of Information Science and Engineering, Hunan University, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Sai","lastName":"Li","orcid":"0000-0002-1561-9610"},{"name":"Imene Trigui","affiliation":["University of Quebec, Montreal, QC, Canada"],"firstName":"Imene","lastName":"Trigui"},{"name":"Rongchang Ma","affiliation":["Hunan Castking Intelligent Manufacturing Technology Company Ltd., Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Rongchang","lastName":"Ma"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"9585102","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":193},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference","Signal to noise ratio","Bit error rate","Performance analysis","Wireless communication","Probability density function","Probability"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)","outage probability (OP)","average bit error rate (BER)","co-channel interference (CCI)"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9585102","doi":"10.1109/LCOMM.2021.3122468","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCOMM.2021.3122468","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9674048","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/4234/9674048/09585102.pdf","startPage":"49","endPage":"53","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance Analysis of RIS-Aided Networks With Co-Channel Interference","abstract":"In this letter, we investigate the performance of reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-aided networks in the presence of non-identically distributed interferers at the destination.

In this paper, two effective techniques to improve spectral efficiency, namely, sparse code multiple access (SCMA) and wireless multicast, are used together for the IoT system to expand network capacity. Different from existing works, we introduce layered coding into the SCMA-based IoT system and consider two channel state information (CSI) feedback scenarios, which can make full use of the diversity gain of multiple receivers. The original multicast data are divided into one basic layer (BL) and several enhancement layers (ELs) by layered coding. IoT receivers with good channel gain can achieve better quality of service by receiving more data layers. In the transmission scheme with CSI, the physical resources allocated to the BL and ELs can be dynamically adjusted. In the transmission scheme without CSI, a fixed resource allocation scheme is performed because it is impossible to calculate the multicast rate of each codebook in real time. To further improve the system capacity, we have proposed resource allocation algorithms for these two schemes according to different requirements for computational complexity. The simulation results show that the proposed schemes can provide a higher system capacity than unicast SCMA and nonlayered multicast SCMA.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3122449","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/9312710/09585104.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3122449","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9312710","startPage":"144776","endPage":"144785","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Resource Allocation for SCMA-Based IoT Systems With Layered Multicast","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9585104","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Resource Allocation for SCMA-Based IoT Systems With Layered Multicast","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9585104/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 October 2021","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"volume":"9","publicationDate":"2021","dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9585104/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100010818","fundingName":"Foundation of Beijing Information Science and Technology University","grantNumber":"2025020"},{"fundingName":"Enterprise Entrusted Project","grantNumber":"S2026080"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"62001033"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100010818","fundingName":"Qin Xin Talents Cultivation Program of Beijing Information Science and Technology University","grantNumber":"QXTCPC202108"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Resource Allocation for SCMA-Based IoT Systems With Layered Multicast","sourcePdf":"access-zhang-3122449-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.116669S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"9312710","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","xplore-issue":"9312710","articleId":"9585104","onlineDate":"25 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-11-06"},{"_id":9585108,"authors":[{"name":"Mangqing Guo","affiliation":["Syracuse University, Syracuse, NY, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/9681827/9585108/guo-3122471-small.gif","p":["Mangqing Guo received the B.S. degree in measuring and control technology and instrumentation program from Jilin University, Changchun, China, in 2013, and the M.S. degree in electronics science and technology from the Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China, in 2016.

In this paper, we investigate the minimum mean square error (MMSE) estimation of effective channel coefficients in cell-free massive MIMO systems with massive connectivity. To facilitate the theoretical analysis, only single measurement vector (SMV) based MMSE estimation is considered in this paper, i.e., the MMSE estimation is performed based on the received pilot signals at each AP separately. Inspired by the decoupling principle of replica symmetric postulated MMSE estimation of sparse signal vectors with independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) non-zero components, we develop the corresponding decoupling principle for the SMV based MMSE estimation of sparse signal vectors with independent and non-identically distributed (i.n.i.d.) non-zero components, which plays a key role in the theoretical analysis of SMV based MMSE estimation of the effective channel coefficients in cell-free massive MIMO systems with massive connectivity. Subsequently, based on the obtained decoupling principle of MMSE estimation, likelihood ratio test and the optimal fusion rule, we perform user activity detection based on the received pilot signals at only one AP, or cooperation among the entire set of APs for centralized or distributed detection. Via theoretical analysis, we show that the error probabilities of both centralized and distributed detection tend to zero when the number of APs tends to infinity while the asymptotic ratio between the number of users and pilots is kept constant. We also investigate the asymptotic behavior of oracle estimation in cell-free massive MIMO systems with massive connectivity via random matrix theory. Moreover, in order to demonstrate the potential performance loss of SMV based MMSE estimation, which does not employ the correlation between the received pilot signals at different APs, the multiple measurement vector (MMV) based MMSE estimation, i.e., joint MMSE estimation with pilot signals from all APs, is analyzed via numerical results. Numerical analysis shows that the theoretical analyze with our decoupling principle for the SMV based MMSE estimation of sparse signal vectors with i.n.i.d. non-zero components matches well with the numerical results.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2021.3122471","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2021.3122471","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9681827","startPage":"317","endPage":"331","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/9681827/09585108.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9585108","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Estimation","Massive MIMO","Approximation algorithms","Signal processing algorithms","Fading channels","Mean square error methods","Channel estimation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MMSE estimation","cell-free massive MIMO","massive connectivity","complex Bayesian approximate message passing","activity detection","likelihood ratio test"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Joint Activity Detection and Channel Estimation in Cell-Free Massive MIMO Networks With Massive Connectivity","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2022","isJournal":true,"volume":"70","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2022","dateOfInsertion":"14 January 2022","htmlLink":"/document/9585108/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 October 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9585108/","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"CCF-1618615"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint Activity Detection and Channel Estimation in Cell-Free Massive MIMO Networks With Massive Connectivity","sourcePdf":"tcomm-gursoy-3122471-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.118468S","chronDate":"Jan.  2022","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"9681827","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","xplore-issue":"9681827","articleId":"9585108","onlineDate":"25 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2022","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-23"},{"_id":9585110,"authors":[{"name":"Wei Qian","affiliation":["School of Operations Research and Information Engineering, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, USA","DiDi AI Labs, Mountain View, CA, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Wei Qian received the B.S. degree in mathematics from the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, in 2014, and the Ph.D. and M.S. degrees in operations research from Cornell University in 2020.

Although CNNs have shown impressive results on various tasks such as natural language processing, image classification, or voice recognition using Graphical Processing Units (GPUs) for training, it is expensive and is not suitable for hardware implementation. The emergence of SNNs is a solution for CNNs in terms of energy consumption. In the dozen types of hardware, Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) is a promising approach for SNN implementation on hardware. This paper provides a survey of a number of FGPA-based SNN implementations focused on some aspects such as neuron models, network architecture, training algorithms and applications.

It causes a great damage to lives, infrastructure and environments, such as traffic congestion and high accidents. Therefore, automated landslide detection is an important task for warning and reducing its consequences such as blocked traffic or traffic accidents. For instance, people approaching the disaster area can adjust their routes to avoid blocked roads, or dangerous traffic signs can be positioned in time to warn the traffic participants to avoid the interrupted road ahead. This paper proposes a method to detect blocked roads caused by landslide by utilizing images captured from Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV). The proposed method comprises of three components: road segmentation, blocked road candidate extraction, and blocked road classification, which is leveraged by a multi-stage convolutional neural network model. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can surpass over several state-of-the art methods on our self-collected dataset of 400 images captured with an UAV.","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 International Conference on Multimedia Analysis and Pattern Recognition (MAPR)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9585222/9585196/09585261.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","publicationTitle":"2021 International Conference on Multimedia Analysis and Pattern Recognition (MAPR)","doi":"10.1109/MAPR53640.2021.9585261","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MAPR53640.2021.9585261","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9585196","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9585261","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Landslide Detection with Unmanned Aerial Vehicles","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image segmentation","Art","Roads","Unmanned aerial vehicles","Terrain factors","Pattern recognition","Convolutional neural networks"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Convolutional neural network","UAV","Landslide detection"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9585261/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-16 Oct. 2021","displayDocTitle":"Landslide Detection with Unmanned Aerial Vehicles","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9585261/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"01 November 2021","conferenceDate":"15-16 Oct. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Landslide Detection with Unmanned Aerial Vehicles","confLoc":"Hanoi, Vietnam","sourcePdf":"2021005209.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.08632S","chronDate":"15-16 Oct. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9585222","isNumber":"9585196","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9585222","xplore-issue":"9585196","articleId":"9585261","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-05"},{"_id":9585362,"authors":[{"name":"Yanze Huang","affiliation":["College of Computer and Cyber Security, Fujian Normal University, Fuzhou, Fujian, China","School of Computer Science and Mathematics, Fujian University of Technology, Fuzhou, Fujian, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/71/9603995/9585362/huang-3122440-small.gif","p":["Yanze Huang received the BS and MS degrees in mathematics from Xiamen University, Xiamen, China, in 2008 and 2011, respectively, and the PhD degree in mathematics from the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, in 2015.

Cyberspace security threats stem from the problem of endogenous security, which is caused by the incompleteness of theoretical system and technology of the information field itself. Thus it is impossible and unnecessary for us to build an \u201caseptic\u201d cyberspace. On the contrast, we must focus on improving the \u201cself-immunity\u201d of network. Literally, endogenous security is an endogenous effect from its own structural factors rather than external ones. The \n<inline-formula><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$t/k$</tex-math></inline-formula>\n-diagnosis strategy plays a very important role in measuring endogenous network security without prior knowledge, which can significantly enhance the self-diagnosing capability of network. As far as we know, few research involves \n<inline-formula><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$t/k$</tex-math></inline-formula>\n-diagnosis algorithm and \n<inline-formula><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$t/k$</tex-math></inline-formula>\n-diagnosability of interconnection networks under MM* model.

magnetic resonance images (MRI) from highly undersampled measurements by using compressed sensing (CS), in this letter, we propose a hybrid regularization model from deep prior and low-rank prior. The local deep prior is explored by a fast flexible denoising convolutional neural network (FFDNet). To compensate for 1) the generalization capability of FFDNet on artifact noise caused by undersampling K-space and 2) the inaccurate noise estimation for various undersampling ratios, we model the low-rank prior as a weighted Schatten p-norm to obtain the global information of MRIs. The final model, combined by the local deep and low-rank priors, is solved by the alternating directional method of multipliers under the plug-and-play framework. Compared with the popular CS-MRI approaches, the experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve better reconstruction performance in terms of quality index and visual effects.","doi":"10.1109/LSP.2021.3122338","publicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/97/9686799/09585373.pdf","startPage":"21","endPage":"25","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LSP.2021.3122338","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9686799","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9585373","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Compressed Sensing MRI by Integrating Deep Denoiser and Weighted Schatten P-Norm Minimization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Compressed Sensing MRI by Integrating Deep Denoiser and Weighted Schatten P-Norm Minimization","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9585373/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 October 2021","chronOrPublicationDate":"2022","volume":"29","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9585373/","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2022","publicationDate":"2022","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Compressed Sensing MRI by Integrating Deep Denoiser and Weighted Schatten P-Norm Minimization","sourcePdf":"lsp-liu-3122338-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.084259S","chronDate":"2022","xplore-pub-id":"97","isNumber":"9686799","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"97","xplore-issue":"9686799","articleId":"9585373","onlineDate":"26 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2022","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-26"},{"_id":9585393,"authors":[{"name":"Jarrad Courts","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering and Built Environment, The University of Newcastle, Callaghan, NSW, Australia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/9307529/9585393/court-3122296-small.gif","p":["Jarrad Courts received the B.E. degree in 2017 in mechatronics (with first-class Hons.) from The University of Newcastle, Callaghan, NSW, Australia, where he is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree.

Due to the nonlinear nature of the models, the state estimation problem is generally intractable as it involves integrals of general nonlinear functions and the filtered and smoothed state distributions lack closed-form solutions. As such, it is common to approximate the state estimation problem. In this paper, we develop an assumed Gaussian solution based on variational inference, which offers the key advantage of a flexible, but principled, mechanism for approximating the required distributions. Our main contribution lies in a new formulation of the state estimation problem as an optimisation problem, which can then be solved using standard optimisation routines that employ exact first- and second-order derivatives. The resulting state estimation approach involves a minimal number of assumptions and applies directly to nonlinear systems with both Gaussian and non-Gaussian probabilistic models. The performance of our approach is demonstrated on several examples; a challenging scalar system, a model of a simple robotic system, and a target tracking problem using a von Mises-Fisher distribution and outperforms alternative assumed Gaussian approaches to state estimation.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2021.3122296","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/78/9307529/09585393.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9307529","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2021.3122296","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","startPage":"5979","endPage":"5993","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Gaussian Variational State Estimation for Nonlinear State-Space Models","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9585393","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 October 2021","displayDocTitle":"Gaussian Variational State Estimation for Nonlinear State-Space Models","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9585393/","volume":"69","htmlLink":"/document/9585393/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"2021","dateOfInsertion":"10 November 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Kjell och M\u00e4rta Beijer Foundation"},{"fundingName":"Projects Learning flexible models for nonlinear dynamics","grantNumber":"2017-03807"},{"fundingName":"NewLEADS - New Directions in Learning Dynamical Systems","grantNumber":"621-2016-06079"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004359","fundingName":"Vetenskapsr\u00e5det"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Gaussian Variational State Estimation for Nonlinear State-Space Models","sourcePdf":"tsp-courts-3122296-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.109743S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"9307529","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","xplore-issue":"9307529","articleId":"9585393","onlineDate":"26 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-12"},{"_id":9585405,"authors":[{"name":"Vaibhav Venugopal Rao","affiliation":["Drexel University, Philadelphia, PA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/92/9627316/9585405/rao-3109062-small.gif","p":["Vaibhav Venugopal Rao (Student Member, IEEE) received the B.E. degree in electronics and communications from Visvesvaraya Technological University, Belgaum, India, in 2015, and the M.Sc. degree in computer engineering from Drexel University, Philadelphia, PA, USA, in 2017, where he is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree at the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering.","His current research interests include circuit-level techniques to protect analog IP from intellectual property theft and counterfeiting, and variation-aware automation of analog circuit design to reduce design time."]},"firstName":"Vaibhav","lastName":"Venugopal Rao","orcid":"0000-0002-9369-1730"},{"name":"Ioannis Savidis","affiliation":["Drexel University, Philadelphia, PA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/92/9627316/9585405/savid-3109062-small.gif","p":["Ioannis Savidis (Senior Member, IEEE) received the B.S.E. degree in electrical and computer engineering and biomedical engineering from Duke University, Durham, NC, USA, in 2005, and the M.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical and computer engineering from the University of Rochester, Rochester, NY, USA, in 2007 and 2013, respectively.","He joined the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Drexel University, Philadelphia, PA, USA, in 2013, where he is currently an Associate Professor and directs the Integrated Circuits and Electronics (ICE) Design and Analysis Laboratory.

Vector- and mesh-based obfuscations are developed that provide different degrees of circuit security with tradeoffs in design complexity and area. An algorithm for the selection of an obfuscation transistor and a satisfiability modulo theory (SMT)-based algorithm that searches the design space to determine the dimensions of the obfuscation transistors are developed to reduce the computational complexity of designing and implementing the proposed parameter obfuscation techniques. The parameter obfuscation techniques, along with the developed algorithms, are implemented on an active inductor-based second-order bandpass filter (BPF) and an operational amplifier (op-amp). The results from the analysis of the obfuscated BPF and op-amp indicate that the critical circuit performances are properly locked with at least 15% variation from the target circuit parameters when setting incorrect transistor sizes. A simulation-based optimization algorithm is proposed to tune the biasing conditions and transistor body voltages, which mitigates the effects of both the parasitic impedance of the circuit and any variation due to the implementation of the obfuscation circuitry. The proposed simulation-based optimization algorithm determines the biasing conditions and body voltages of the BPF in 500 iterations and the op-amp circuit in 70 iterations, which provides a significant reduction in the design time and the number of circuit recycles. Implementing the parameter obfuscation technique with the proposed algorithms provides an efficient means to secure analog circuits while reducing the design time to implement security features.","doi":"10.1109/TVLSI.2021.3109062","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/92/9627316/09585405.pdf","startPage":"2013","endPage":"2026","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9627316","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVLSI.2021.3109062","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9585405","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 October 2021","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9585405/","displayDocTitle":"Performance and Security Analysis of Parameter-Obfuscated Analog Circuits","volume":"29","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 2021","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9585405/","dateOfInsertion":"25 November 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Drexel Ventures Innovation Fund"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"CNS-1751032"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance and Security Analysis of Parameter-Obfuscated Analog Circuits","sourcePdf":"tvlsi-venugopalrao-3109062-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.066553S","chronDate":"Dec.  2021","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"9627316","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","xplore-issue":"9627316","articleId":"9585405","onlineDate":"26 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-30"},{"_id":9585408,"authors":[{"name":"Haoran Ji","affiliation":["Tianjin International Engineering Institute, Tianjin University, Tianjin, China"],"firstName":"Haoran","lastName":"Ji","orcid":"0000-0001-6632-1235"},{"name":"Chunping Hou","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Information Engineering, Tianjin University, Tianjin, China"],"firstName":"Chunping","lastName":"Hou"},{"name":"Yang Yang","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Information Engineering, Tianjin University, Tianjin, China"],"firstName":"Yang","lastName":"Yang","orcid":"0000-0002-1364-8653"},{"name":"Francesco Fioranelli","affiliation":["MS3 Section, Department of Microelectronics, TU Delft, Delft, The Netherlands"],"firstName":"Francesco","lastName":"Fioranelli","orcid":"0000-0001-8254-8093"},{"name":"Yue Lang","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Hebei University of Technology, Tianjin, China"],"firstName":"Yue","lastName":"Lang","orcid":"0000-0002-8160-2999"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1070-9908"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2361"}],"articleNumber":"9585408","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":83},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"abstract":"In this letter, a radar-based gait authentication method is proposed.

We provide results on three dynamic sensor adaptation approaches including an end-to-end Deep Q-Learning approach that can overcome the resource and performance limitations inherent to conventional static methods.","doi":"10.1109/LSP.2021.3122355","publicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/97/9686799/09585414.pdf","startPage":"26","endPage":"30","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LSP.2021.3122355","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9686799","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9585414","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Data-Driven Waveform Adaptation Method for Mm-Wave Gait Classification at the Edge","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Data-Driven Waveform Adaptation Method for Mm-Wave Gait Classification at the Edge","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9585414/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 October 2021","chronOrPublicationDate":"2022","volume":"29","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9585414/","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2022","publicationDate":"2022","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000028","fundingName":"Semiconductor Research Corporation"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000185","fundingName":"Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Data-Driven Waveform Adaptation Method for Mm-Wave Gait Classification at the Edge","sourcePdf":"lsp-hor-3122355-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.065798S","chronDate":"2022","xplore-pub-id":"97","isNumber":"9686799","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"97","xplore-issue":"9686799","articleId":"9585414","onlineDate":"26 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2022","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-25"},{"_id":9585415,"authors":[{"name":"Ming Ling","affiliation":["National ASIC System Engineering Technology Research Center, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/92/9627316/9585415/ling-3120653-small.gif","p":["Ming Ling (Member, IEEE) received the B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. degrees from Southeast University, Nanjing, China, in 1994, 2001, and 2011, respectively.","He is currently an Associate Professor with the National ASIC System Engineering Technology Research Center, Southeast University.

Meanwhile, for a given process, voltage, and temperature (PVT) condition, CS-SRAM has an optimal bitline discharging time (TBL) to achieve the lowest average access latency. However, existing timing speculation caches do not track the variations of different PVT conditions to adjust the access timing to the optimal TBL point, on which the system possesses the lowest average memory access time. In this article, we propose a design of CS-SRAM-based L1 caches with a PVT autotracking mechanism, namely TS-PULP, which adjusts both the TBL and the frequency of the system clock to the optimal points. To quantify the improvement of our approach, a cycle-accurate RTL model of CS-SRAM and a field-programmable gate array (FPGA) prototype of the proposed L1 caches with the open-source system on chip (SoC) platform PULP have also been implemented. According to the evaluation results from RTL simulations and the FPGA prototype, the proposed caches can achieve a similar performance (over 80%) of the original standard cell memory (SCM)-based PULP design under TSMC 28 nm 0.5 V and 25 \u00b0C with only about 30% chip area. In addition, we introduced the figure of merit (FOM) of million instructions per second (MIPS), area, and energy (MAE) to comprehensively evaluate different approaches. The proposed scheme, TS-PULP, achieves the best FOM of MAE among four architectures (PULP with SCM, PULP with SRAM, TS-cache, and TS-PULP) with different cache sizes.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Design of Timing Speculation SRAM-Based L1 Caches With PVT Autotracking Under Near-Threshold Voltages","doi":"10.1109/TVLSI.2021.3120653","endPage":"2209","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/92/9627316/09585415.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","startPage":"2197","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVLSI.2021.3120653","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9627316","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9585415","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Timing","Random access memory","Sensors","Field programmable gate arrays","Prototypes","Error correction","Delays"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Field-programmable gate array (FPGA)","low-power design","process","voltage","temperature (PVT) tracking cache","timing speculation SRAM"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Design of Timing Speculation SRAM-Based L1 Caches With PVT Autotracking Under Near-Threshold Voltages","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9585415/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 October 2021","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2021","volume":"29","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/9585415/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"25 November 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)","grantNumber":"61974024"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Design of Timing Speculation SRAM-Based L1 Caches With PVT Autotracking Under Near-Threshold Voltages","sourcePdf":"tvlsi-ling-3120653-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.105296S","chronDate":"Dec.  2021","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"9627316","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","xplore-issue":"9627316","articleId":"9585415","onlineDate":"26 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-30"},{"_id":9585421,"authors":[{"name":"Juncheng Wang","affiliation":["School of Microelectronics and the Engineering Research Center of Integrated Circuits for Next-Generation Communications, Ministry of Education, Southern University of Science and Technology, Shenzhen, China","State Key Laboratory of ASIC and System, Fudan University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Juncheng","lastName":"Wang","orcid":"0000-0003-2060-5691"},{"name":"Xuefeng Chen","affiliation":["PhotonIC Technologies Inc., Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Xuefeng","lastName":"Chen"},{"name":"Rui Bai","affiliation":["PhotonIC Technologies Inc., Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Rui","lastName":"Bai"},{"name":"Patrick Yin Chiang","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of ASIC and System, Fudan University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Patrick Yin","lastName":"Chiang"},{"name":"Quan Pan","affiliation":["School of Microelectronics and the Engineering Research Center of Integrated Circuits for Next-Generation Communications, Ministry of Education, Southern University of Science and Technology, Shenzhen, China"],"firstName":"Quan","lastName":"Pan","orcid":"0000-0001-8704-4505"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-8210"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9999"}],"articleNumber":"9585421","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":93},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Solid-State Circuits Society","url":"http://www.sscs.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optical receivers","Bandwidth","Inductors","Capacitance","Sensitivity","Gain control","Crosstalk"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Automatic gain control","crosstalk","current reusing","low noise","optical receiver","transimpedance amplifier (TIA)"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 4 \u00d7 10 Gb/s Adaptive Optical Receiver Utilizing Current-Reuse and Crosstalk-Remove","abstract":"This article presents a \n<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$4 \\times 10$ </tex-math></inline-formula>\n Gb/s low-noise adaptive optical receiver, utilizing a current-reuse architecture and channel crosstalk-remove techniques in 65-nm CMOS process.

In its standard form, reinforcement learning involves a single agent that uses its policy to accomplish a specific task. These methods require large amounts of reward samples to achieve good performance, and may not generalize well when the task is modified, even if the new task is related. In this paper we are interested in a collaborative scheme in which multiple policies are optimized jointly. To this end, we we introduce \n<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">cross-learning</i>\n, in which policies are trained for related tasks in separate environments, and they are constrained to be close to one another. Two properties make our new approach attractive: (i) it produces a \n<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">multi-task</i>\n central policy that can be used as a starting point to adapt quickly to one of the tasks trained for, and (ii) as in \n<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">meta-learning</i>\n, it adapts to environments related but different to those seen during training. We focus on policies belonging to reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces for which we bound the distance between the task-specific policies and the cross-learned policy. To solve the resulting optimization problem, we resort to a projected policy gradient algorithm and prove that it converges to a near-optimal solution with high probability. We evaluate our methodology with a navigation example in which an agent moves through environments with obstacles of multiple shapes and avoids obstacles not trained for.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9585424/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 October 2021","volume":"69","publicationDate":"2021","htmlLink":"/document/9585424/","dateOfInsertion":"09 November 2021","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Multi-Task Reinforcement Learning in Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces via Cross-Learning","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"ARL DCIST CRA","grantNumber":"W911NF-17-2-0181"},{"fundingName":"Intel Science and Technology Center for Wireless Autonomous Systems"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-Task Reinforcement Learning in Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces via Cross-Learning","sourcePdf":"tsp-cervino-3122303-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.154763S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"9307529","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","xplore-issue":"9307529","articleId":"9585424","onlineDate":"26 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-12"},{"_id":9585434,"authors":[{"name":"Tianqi Jiang","affiliation":["Northwestern Polytechinical University, Xi\u2019an, China"],"firstName":"Tianqi","lastName":"Jiang"},{"name":"Lirong Niu","affiliation":["Shaanxi Radio Monitoring Station, State Radio Monitoring Center, Xi\u2019an, China"],"firstName":"Lirong","lastName":"Niu"},{"name":"Xu Tang","affiliation":["NARI Group Corporation, State Grid Electric Power Research Institute, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Xu","lastName":"Tang"},{"name":"Xiao Tang","affiliation":["Northwestern Polytechinical University, Xi\u2019an, China","National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Xiao","lastName":"Tang","orcid":"0000-0001-8971-5413"},{"name":"Daosen Zhai","affiliation":["Northwestern Polytechinical University, Xi\u2019an, China"],"firstName":"Daosen","lastName":"Zhai"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"9585434","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":115},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Array signal processing","Optimization","Wireless communication","Security","Signal to noise ratio","Atmospheric modeling","Wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Physical layer security","aerial reconfigurable intelligent surface","deep Q-learning"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9585434","doi":"10.1109/LCOMM.2021.3123150","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCOMM.2021.3123150","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9674048","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/4234/9674048/09585434.pdf","startPage":"18","endPage":"22","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Aerial Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface-Assisted Secrecy: A Learning Approach","abstract":"In this letter, we propose to use an aerial reconfigurable intelligent surface (ARIS) to enhance the physical layer security and defend against an eavesdropper.

In particular, we incorporate the RAN information to timely grasp the dynamics of RAN, and empower DRL to learn from the delayed RAN information feedback potentially induced by several consecutive actions. Meanwhile, we relax the implicit assumption (that the feedback to one specific action returns at a round-trip-time (RTT) after the action is applied) in previous researches, by redistributing the rewards and evaluating the merits of actions more accurately. Experiment results show that besides maintaining a reasonable fairness, DRL-3R significantly outperforms classical congestion control methods (e.g., TCP Reno, Westwood, Cubic, BBR and DRL-CC) on network utility by achieving a higher throughput while reducing delay in various network environments.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2021.3123130","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/9681827/09585436.pdf","startPage":"215","endPage":"230","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9681827","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2021.3123130","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2022","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 October 2021","displayDocTitle":"RAN Information-Assisted TCP Congestion Control Using Deep Reinforcement Learning With Reward Redistribution","volume":"70","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/9585436/","dateOfInsertion":"14 January 2022","publicationDate":"Jan. 2022","isJournal":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9585436/","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Key R&D Program of China","grantNumber":"2020YFB1804800"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61731002 and 62071425"},{"fundingName":"Zhejiang Key Research and Development Plan","grantNumber":"2019C01002 and 2019C03131"},{"fundingName":"Huawei Cooperation Project"},{"fundingName":"a Project sponsored by the Zhejiang Lab","grantNumber":"2019LC0AB01"},{"fundingName":"a Project sponsored by the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology","grantNumber":"2019-00891-2-1"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004731","fundingName":"Zhejiang Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"LY20F010016"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"RAN Information-Assisted TCP Congestion Control Using Deep Reinforcement Learning With Reward Redistribution","sourcePdf":"tcomm-chen-3123130-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.122105S","chronDate":"Jan.  2022","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"9681827","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","xplore-issue":"9681827","articleId":"9585436","onlineDate":"26 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2022","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-23"},{"_id":9585443,"authors":[{"name":"Muhammad Ateeq","affiliation":["Faculty of Computing, The Islamia University of Bahawalpur, Bahawalpur, Pakistan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/9312710/9585443/ateeq-3123054-small.gif","p":["Muhammad Ateeq received the bachelor\u2019s degree in computer science from Bahauddin Zakariya University, Multan, in 2005, and the master\u2019s and Ph.D. degrees in computer science from COMSATS University Islamabad, Wah Campus, in 2007, and 2021, respectively.

To achieve this feat, two primary tasks are to identify the influential configurable parameters and availability of comprehensive datasets representative of the real-world scenarios rather than simulated ones. For this article, an extensive dataset covering diverse settings of wireless sensor networks (WSNs) driven internet of things (IoT) is collected. It covers broad variations of 10 pre-configured communication parameters as well as some runtime information. In addition to legacy parameters (e.g., transmission power, and packet size, etc.), we also used two different medium access control protocols (i.e., carrier sense multiple access (CSMA) and time-slotted channel hopping (TSCH)), and routing metrics (i.e., objective function 0 (OF0), minimum rank with hysteresis (MRH), MRH with expected transmission count (ETX\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n)). Important quality of service (QoS) metrics like packet delivery ratio, throughput, and energy consumption against all combinations of the communication parameters are measured and recorded. A statistical analysis is carried out to identify the correlations among the communication parameters and QoS metrics.

The code family is based on tessellations of closed, four-dimensional, hyperbolic manifolds, as first suggested by Guth and Lubotzky. The main contribution of this work is the construction of suitable manifolds via finite presentations of Coxeter groups, their linear representations over Galois fields and topological coverings. We establish a lower bound on the encoding rate \n<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$k/n$ </tex-math></inline-formula>\n of \n<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$13/72 = 0.180\\ldots $ </tex-math></inline-formula>\n and we show that the bound is tight for the examples that we construct. Numerical simulations give evidence that parallelizable decoding schemes of low computational complexity suffice to obtain high performance. These decoding schemes can deal with syndrome noise, so that parity check measurements do not have to be repeated to decode. Our data is consistent with a threshold of around 4% in the phenomenological noise model with syndrome noise in the single-shot regime.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Codes","Manifolds","Decoding","Encoding","Parity check codes","Qubit","Measurement uncertainty"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Quantum codes","quantum error-correction","single-shot decoding","hyperbolic","quantum fault-tolerance","Coxeter groups","cellular automata","belief-propagation"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9660615","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2021.3122352","startPage":"272","endPage":"286","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel7/18/9660615/09585444.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2021.3122352","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Single-Shot Decoding of Linear Rate LDPC Quantum Codes With High Performance","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 October 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Single-Shot Decoding of Linear Rate LDPC Quantum Codes With High Performance","publicationDate":"Jan. 2022","volume":"68","issue":"1","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2021","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9585444/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9585444/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2022","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"UCLQ Fellowship in Quantum Information"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Single-Shot Decoding of Linear Rate LDPC Quantum Codes With High Performance","sourcePdf":"tit-breuckmann-3122352-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.093395S","chronDate":"Jan.  2022","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"9660615","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","xplore-issue":"9660615","articleId":"9585444","onlineDate":"26 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2022","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-22"},{"_id":9585445,"authors":[{"name":"Sartaj Ul Hasan","affiliation":["Indian Institute of Technology Jammu, Jammu, India"],"bio":{"p":["Sartaj Ul Hasan was born in Shahjahanpur, India, in July 1981.

Chemical oxygen demand (COD) is one of the key features of wastewater treatment. Traditional monitoring methods are time consuming and have high costs making it difficult to meet the needs of rapid monitoring in practical applications. To address this issue, a method for optimizing a long short term memory (LSTM) neural network model based on adaptive hybrid mutation particle swarm optimization (AHMPSO) and an attention mechanism (AM) is proposed. As the hyperparameters of the LSTM are difficult to select, AHMPSO is used to optimize the LSTM. A nonlinear variable inertia weight with random factors is introduced to balance the global search ability and the local search ability and to improve the convergence speed of the PSO algorithm. In addition, the hybrid mutation strategy is added in the search process to reduce the risk of particles falling into local optimal solutions. Finally, an AM is added to the LSTM model to mine local water quality features to improve the effluent COD prediction accuracy. Compared with other models (LSTM, LSTM-AM, and PSO-LSTM-AM), the RMSE(the root mean square error) of the optimized model decreased by 7.803%-19.499%, the MAE(the mean absolute error) of the optimized model decreased by 9.669%-27.551%, the MAPE(the mean absolute error) of the optimized model decreased by 8.993%-25.996%, and the R\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n (the coefficient of determination) value of the optimized model increased by 3.313%-11.229%.

Two-way energy trading allows the surplus or shortfall of renewable energy to be traded between a server and the smart grid, but is non-trivial due to randomly varying computation demands and renewables. This paper proposes a new online policy, namely, distributed online resource allocation and load management (DORL), which enables such an edge server and its serving devices to minimize their energy cost and energy consumption, respectively, in a fully distributed manner. The key idea is that we employ the stochastic dual-subgradient method to interpret the battery of the server as a virtual queue. Based on the virtual queue and task queues, the CPU frequencies of the devices and the edge server, the offloading transmit rates of the devices (to the server) and the energy trading decisions of the server (with the smart grid) are decoupled over time and among devices, and optimized on an ongoing basis. Furthermore, we prove that the DORL yields a feasible and asymptotically optimal solution with a cost-backlog tradeoff of \n<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$[\\eta, 1/\\eta]$ </tex-math></inline-formula>\n.

In particular, two novel waveform design optimization problems based on constructive interference (CI) are proposed, where a constraint of waveform similarity error (WSE) and a joint radar-communication objective function are imposed under a Pareto optimization framework, by taking into account different transmit power constraints. To tackle the proposed optimization problems, we propose specifically tailored convex optimization techniques by using manifold algorithms. Numerical results show that the CI-based methods outperform the existing least-squares (LS) based methods, in terms of the symbol error rate (SER), without the need of knowing the exact constellation power.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radar","Optimization","Pareto optimization","Interference","Radar antennas","Manifolds","MIMO communication"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Radar-communication","constructive interference","pareto optimization","manifold optimization"]}],"doi":"10.1109/LCOMM.2021.3122980","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/4234/9674048/09585492.pdf","startPage":"148","endPage":"152","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9674048","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCOMM.2021.3122980","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dual-Functional Radar-Communication Waveform Design: Interference Reduction Versus Exploitation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9585492","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Dual-Functional Radar-Communication Waveform Design: Interference Reduction Versus Exploitation","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9585492/","volume":"26","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2022","htmlLink":"/document/9585492/","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"07 January 2022","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2022","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 October 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)","grantNumber":"62101234"},{"fundingName":"China Academy of Information and Communication Technology (CAICT) Collaboration","grantNumber":"CG20210717002"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dual-Functional Radar-Communication Waveform Design: Interference Reduction Versus Exploitation","sourcePdf":"lcomm-liu-3122980-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043789S","chronDate":"Jan.  2022","xplore-pub-id":"4234","isNumber":"9674048","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4234","xplore-issue":"9674048","articleId":"9585492","onlineDate":"26 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2022","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-10"},{"_id":9585511,"authors":[{"name":"Xingtuo Zhang","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Guangxi University, Nanning, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/19/9259274/9585511/xzhan-3120796-small.gif","p":["Xingtuo Zhang was born in Sichuan, China, in 1992.

However, the fault area on the insulator string occupies a relatively small portion of the entire image, which will make detection difficult. This article presents an intelligent fault detection method for overhead line insulators based on aerial images and improved you only look once (YOLOv3) deep learning technology. In our model, a densely connected feature pyramid network (FPN) is proposed. First, this network can improve the utilization rate of the strong semantic information of deep features and the localization information of shallow features, thereby improving the small insulator fault (missing-cap) detection performance of the YOLOv3 model. Second, this network reduces the number of parameters of the YOLOv3 model, resulting in a low risk of network over-fitting for small datasets. The experimental results on the CPLID dataset show that our model has higher detection accuracy in localization of overhead line insulators and detection of insulator missing-cap faults compared with the existing works.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9259274","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIM.2021.3120796","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","pdfPath":"/iel7/19/9259274/09585511.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"12","doi":"10.1109/TIM.2021.3120796","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"InsuDet: A Fault Detection Method for Insulators of Overhead Transmission Lines Using Convolutional Neural Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","displayDocTitle":"InsuDet: A Fault Detection Method for Insulators of Overhead Transmission Lines Using Convolutional Neural Networks","volume":"70","htmlLink":"/document/9585511/","isJournal":true,"externalId":"5018512","publicationDate":"2021","dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9585511/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 October 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"51867003"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004607","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Guangxi","grantNumber":"2018JJB160064 and 2018JJA160176"},{"fundingName":"Guangxi Bagui Young Scholars Special Funding"},{"fundingName":"Boshike Award Scheme for Young Innovative Talents, Guangxi Key Laboratory of Power System Optimization and Energy Technology Project","grantNumber":"AE3020001829"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100013091","fundingName":"Guangxi Science and Technology Base and Talent Special Project","grantNumber":"2019AC20096"},{"fundingName":"Basic Ability Improvement Project for Young and Middle-aged Teachers, Universities of Guangxi","grantNumber":"20190067 and 20190046"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"InsuDet: A Fault Detection Method for Insulators of Overhead Transmission Lines Using Convolutional Neural Networks","sourcePdf":"tim-zhang-3120796-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.131962S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"19","isNumber":"9259274","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"19","xplore-issue":"9259274","articleId":"9585511","onlineDate":"26 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-26"},{"_id":9585526,"authors":[{"name":"Jonathan C.

In particular, a great amount of effort has gone towards development of capacity achieving detectors with affordable computational complexity. The developed detectors may be broadly divided into two classes: (i) deterministic sampling, such as list sphere decoding detector; and (ii) stocastic sampling, such as those based on Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) search schemes. This paper proposes a novel detection scheme that is based on stochastic sampling, but is fundamentally different from the MCMC detectors. While MCMC follows a set of sequential sampling steps, hence, the sample sets obtained are highly correlated, the method proposed in this paper takes stochastic samples that are completely independent. This new approach of stochastic sampling leads to a detector with significantly reduced complexity. It also allows reduction in the detector latency.","doi":"10.1109/OJCOMS.2021.3122916","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/OJCOMS.2021.3122916","startPage":"2436","endPage":"2448","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Open Journal of the Communications Society","pdfPath":"/iel7/8782661/9309127/09585526.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Open Journal of the Communications Society","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9309127","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Capacity Achieving MIMO Detector Based on Stochastic Sampling","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 October 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","displayDocTitle":"A Capacity Achieving MIMO Detector Based on Stochastic Sampling","publicationDate":"2021","dateOfInsertion":"13 November 2021","volume":"2","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9585526/","isOpenAccess":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9585526/","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"NSF SBIR","grantNumber":"1632569"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"A Capacity Achieving MIMO Detector Based on Stochastic Sampling","sourcePdf":"ojcoms-farhangboroujeny-3122916-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.096991S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"8782661","isNumber":"9309127","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8782661","xplore-issue":"9309127","articleId":"9585526","onlineDate":"26 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-12-26"},{"_id":9585528,"authors":[{"name":"Florian Meyer","affiliation":["Scripps Institution of Oceanography and the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/9307529/9585528/meyer-3121631-small.gif","p":["Florian Meyer (Member, IEEE) received the Dipl.-Ing.

This paper presents a factor graph formulation and a particle-based sum-product algorithm (SPA) for scalable detection and tracking of extended objects. The proposed method dynamically introduces states of newly detected objects, efficiently performs probabilistic multiple-measurement to object association, and jointly infers the geometric shapes of objects. Scalable extended object tracking (EOT) is enabled by modeling association uncertainty by measurement-oriented association variables and newly detected objects by a Poisson birth process. Contrary to conventional EOT methods, a fully particle-based approach makes it possible to describe different geometric object shapes. The proposed method can reliably detect, localize, and track a large number of closely-spaced extended objects without gating and clustering of measurements. We demonstrate significant performance advantages of our approach compared to the recently introduced Poisson multi-Bernoulli mixture filter. In particular, we consider a simulated scenarios with up to twenty closely-spaced objects and a real autonomous driving application where measurements are captured by a lidar sensor.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2021.3121631","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/78/9307529/09585528.pdf","startPage":"6283","endPage":"6298","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9307529","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2021.3121631","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9585528","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 October 2021","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9585528/","displayDocTitle":"Scalable Detection and Tracking of Geometric Extended Objects","volume":"69","publicationDate":"2021","isOpenAccess":true,"isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9585528/","dateOfInsertion":"02 December 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"University of California San Diego"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000006","fundingName":"Office of Naval Research","grantNumber":"N00014-21-1-2267"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Scalable Detection and Tracking of Geometric Extended Objects","sourcePdf":"tsp-meyer-3121631-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.113653S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"9307529","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"9307529","articleId":"9585528","onlineDate":"26 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-12-10"},{"_id":9585542,"authors":[{"name":"Saeid Sedighi","affiliation":["Interdisciplinary Centre for Security, Reliability, and Trust, University of Luxembourg, Luxembourg, Luxembourg"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/9307529/9585542/sedig-3122290-small.gif","p":["Saeid Sedighi (Member, IEEE) was born in Tehran, Iran, in 1987.

Additionally, deployment of one-bit Analog-to-Digital Converters (ADCs) has emerged as an important topic in array processing, as it offers both a low-cost and a low-complexity implementation. In this paper, we study the problem of DoA estimation from one-bit measurements received by an SLA. Specifically, we first investigate the identifiability conditions for the DoA estimation problem from one-bit SLA data and establish an equivalency with the case when DoAs are estimated from infinite-bit unquantized measurements. Towards determining the performance limits of DoA estimation from one-bit quantized data, we derive a pessimistic approximation of the corresponding Cram\u00e9r-Rao Bound (CRB). This pessimistic CRB is then used as a benchmark for assessing the performance of one-bit DoA estimators. We also propose a new algorithm for estimating DoAs from one-bit quantized data. We investigate the analytical performance of the proposed method through deriving a closed-form expression for the covariance matrix of the asymptotic distribution of the DoA estimation errors and show that it outperforms the existing algorithms in the literature. Numerical simulations are provided to validate the analytical derivations and corroborate the resulting performance improvement.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2021.3122290","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/78/9307529/09585542.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9307529","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2021.3122290","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","startPage":"6165","endPage":"6182","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Performance of One-Bit DoA Estimation via Sparse Linear Arrays","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9585542","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 October 2021","displayDocTitle":"On the Performance of One-Bit DoA Estimation via Sparse Linear Arrays","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9585542/","volume":"69","htmlLink":"/document/9585542/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"2021","dateOfInsertion":"16 November 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Luxembourg National Research Fund","grantNumber":"11228830"},{"fundingName":"SPRINGER projects"},{"fundingName":"European Research Council","grantNumber":"742648"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"1704401 and 1809225"},{"fundingName":"Illinois Discovery Partners Institute"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Performance of One-Bit DoA Estimation via Sparse Linear Arrays","sourcePdf":"tsp-sedighi-3122290-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.125581S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"9307529","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","xplore-issue":"9307529","articleId":"9585542","onlineDate":"26 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-18"},{"_id":9585549,"authors":[{"name":"Ning Yan","affiliation":["CAS Key Laboratory of Technology in Geo-Spatial Information Processing and Application System, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China","Kwai Inc., Hangzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/83/9263394/9585549/yan-3121131-small.gif","p":["Ning Yan received the B.S. degree in information engineering from the China University of Mining and Technology, Xuzhou, China, in 2015, and the Ph.D. degree in electronic engineering and information science from the University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China, in 2020.

Previously, human vision and machine vision have been extensively studied by image (signal) compression and (image) feature compression, respectively. Recently, for joint human-machine vision, several studies have been devoted to joint compression of images and features, but the correlation between images and features is still unclear. We identify the deep network as a powerful toolkit for generating structural image representations. From the perspective of information theory, the deep features of an image naturally form an entropy decreasing series: a scalable bitstream is achieved by compressing the features backward from a deeper layer to a shallower layer until culminating with the image signal. Moreover, we can obtain learned representations by training the deep network for a given semantic analysis task or multiple tasks and acquire deep features that are related to semantics. With the learned structural representations, we propose SSSIC, a framework to obtain an embedded bitstream that can be either partially decoded for semantic analysis or fully decoded for human vision. We implement an exemplar SSSIC scheme using coarse-to-fine image classification as the driven semantic analysis task. We also extend the scheme for object detection and instance segmentation tasks. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed SSSIC framework and establish that the exemplar scheme achieves higher compression efficiency than separate compression of images and features.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image coding","Feature extraction","Task analysis","Semantics","Decoding","Image representation","Scalability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer vision","data compression","entropy","feature extraction","image classification","image coding","image representation","image segmentation","learning (artificial intelligence)","object detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["joint human-machine vision","joint compression","deep network","structural image representations","deep features","image signal","given semantic analysis task","learned structural representations","SSSIC","human vision","coarse-to-fine image classification","driven semantic analysis task","higher compression efficiency","separate compression","semantics-to-signal scalable image coding","decoded image","human observation","image compression"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Feature compression","image compression","image representation","machine vision","scalable coding"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Data Compression","Humans","Machine Learning","Neural Networks, Computer","Semantics"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TIP.2021.3121131","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/83/9263394/09585549.pdf","startPage":"8939","endPage":"8954","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9263394","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2021.3121131","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"SSSIC: Semantics-to-Signal Scalable Image Coding With Learned Structural Representations","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9585549","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"SSSIC: Semantics-to-Signal Scalable Image Coding With Learned Structural Representations","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9585549/","volume":"30","publicationDate":"2021","htmlLink":"/document/9585549/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"21255893","pubMedId":"34699359","dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 October 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100012166","fundingName":"National Key Research and Development Program of China","grantNumber":"2018YFA0701603"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"62022075, 62021001 and 61836011"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SSSIC: Semantics-to-Signal Scalable Image Coding With Learned Structural Representations","sourcePdf":"tip-liu-3121131-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.114309S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"9263394","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","xplore-issue":"9263394","articleId":"9585549","onlineDate":"26 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-05"},{"_id":9585555,"authors":[{"name":"Woo-Joong Kim","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/71/9603995/9585555/kim-3122454-small.gif","p":["Woo-Joong Kim (Member, IEEE) received the MS degree in electrical engineering from the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), Daejeon, South Korea, in 2014, and the PhD degree in electrical engineering from the Korea Advanced Institute of Technology (KAIST), Daejeon, South Korea.

In principle, to apply the explainable DNN model for the process of satellite image analysis and retraining, we consider a new acceleration scheduling mechanism. Especially, the conventional DNN acceleration schemes cause serious performance degradation due to computational complexity and costs in satellite image analysis and retraining. In this article, to overcome the performance degradation, we propose cooperative scheduling schemes for explainable DNN acceleration in analysis and retraining process. For the purpose of it, we define the latency and energy cost modeling to derive the optimized processing time and cost required for explainable DNN acceleration. Especially, we show a minimum processing cost considered in the proposed scheduling via layer-level management of the explainable DNN on FPGA-GPU acceleration system. In addition, we evaluate the performance using an adaptive unlabeled data selection scheme with confidence threshold and a semi-supervised learning driven data parallelism scheme in accelerating retraining process. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed schemes reduce the energy cost of the conventional DNN acceleration systems by up to about 40% while guaranteeing the latency constraints.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/71/9603995/09585555.pdf","startPage":"1605","endPage":"1618","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","doi":"10.1109/TPDS.2021.3122454","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPDS.2021.3122454","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9603995","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9585555","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cooperative Scheduling Schemes for Explainable DNN Acceleration in Satellite Image Analysis and Retraining","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Satellites","Image analysis","Field programmable gate arrays","Costs","Graphics processing units","Task analysis","Labeling"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cooperative satellite image analysis and retraining","DNN acceleration","distributed deep learning"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9585555/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July 1 2022","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 October 2021","displayDocTitle":"Cooperative Scheduling Schemes for Explainable DNN Acceleration in Satellite Image Analysis and Retraining","volume":"33","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/9585555/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"1 July 2022","dateOfInsertion":"04 November 2021","isOpenAccess":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Defense Challengeable Future Technology Program"},{"fundingName":"Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd","grantNumber":"IO201210-07976-01"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100010418","fundingName":"Institute for Information and Communications Technology Promotion","grantNumber":"2017-0-00294"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Cooperative Scheduling Schemes for Explainable DNN Acceleration in Satellite Image Analysis and Retraining","sourcePdf":"tpds-youn-3122454-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.144873S","chronDate":"July 1 2022","xplore-pub-id":"71","isNumber":"9603995","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"71","xplore-issue":"9603995","articleId":"9585555","onlineDate":"26 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2022","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-11-06"},{"_id":9585561,"authors":[{"name":"Bing Liu","affiliation":["PLA Strategic Support Force Information Engineering University, Zhengzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4609443/9314330/9585561/liu-3121334-small.gif","p":["Bing Liu received the B.S. degree in measurement and control engineering, the M.S. degree in pattern recognition and intelligent system, and the Ph.D. degree in surveying and mapping science and technology from Information Engineering University, Zhengzhou, China, in 2013, 2016, and 2019, respectively.","He is currently working with the Information Engineering University as an Associate Professor.

However, using less labeled samples to obtain higher classification accuracy is still a challenging task. In this study, we propose a patch-free bilateral network (PBiNet) for HSI classification. In order to make better use of the features with different scales, PBiNet uses the spatial path and the semantic path to obtain different level features for classification. The spatial path with small stride is used to retain the spatial detail information. The semantic path with fast down sampling rate is used to retain high-level semantic information. Using fast downsampling rates is to expand the scope of receptive field, so that semantic branch can better focus on global information. Then we design a feature fusion module to fuse the features obtained by the two paths. Finally, we use the classification maps produced by different scale features to calculate the loss function to optimize the whole model. Due to the better use of different levels of features, the proposed method could achieve higher classification accuracy with limited labeled samples. More importantly, because the whole HSI is used as the input, the proposed method has higher computational efficiency. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, we carried out classification experiments on four popular HSI datasets. Quantitative and qualitative experimental results show that the accuracy of the proposed method exceeds the compared methods.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9314330","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSTARS.2021.3121334","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel7/4609443/9314330/09585561.pdf","startPage":"10794","endPage":"10807","doi":"10.1109/JSTARS.2021.3121334","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Patch-Free Bilateral Network for Hyperspectral Image Classification Using Limited Samples","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","displayDocTitle":"Patch-Free Bilateral Network for Hyperspectral Image Classification Using Limited Samples","volume":"14","htmlLink":"/document/9585561/","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"2021","dateOfInsertion":"13 November 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9585561/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 October 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Patch-Free Bilateral Network for Hyperspectral Image Classification Using Limited Samples","sourcePdf":"jstars-bing-3121334-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.131306S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"4609443","isNumber":"9314330","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4609443","xplore-issue":"9314330","articleId":"9585561","onlineDate":"26 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-12-26"},{"_id":9585586,"authors":[{"name":"Navid Amani","affiliation":["Chalmers University of Technology, Gothenburg, Sweden","Eindhoven University of Technology, Eindhoven, AZ, The Netherlands"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/9312710/9585586/amani-3122967-small.gif","p":["Navid Amani received the M.Sc. degree in telecommunication engineering from the K.

The physical antenna effects are incorporated in the signal model via open-circuited embedded-element patterns (EEPs) and coupling matrices. The transmit (TX) and receive (RX) array are each divided into two uniform sparse sub-arrays with different inter-element spacings to generate two MIMO sets. Since the corresponding virtual arrays (VAs) of both MIMO sets are uniform, the well-known spatial smoothing (SS) algorithm is applied to suppress the temporal correlation among sources. Afterwards, the co-prime array principle between two spatially smoothed VAs is deployed to avoid DOA ambiguities. A performance comparison between the sparse and conventional MIMO radars with the same number of TX and RX channels confirms a spatial resolution enhancement. Meanwhile, the DOA estimation error due to the mutual coupling (MC) is less pronounced in the proposed sparse architecture since antennas in both TX and RX arrays are spaced larger than half wavelength apart.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3122967","startPage":"146822","endPage":"146829","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3122967","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9312710","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/9312710/09585586.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sparse Automotive MIMO Radar for Super-Resolution Single Snapshot DOA Estimation With Mutual Coupling","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9585586/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Sparse Automotive MIMO Radar for Super-Resolution Single Snapshot DOA Estimation With Mutual Coupling","volume":"9","htmlLink":"/document/9585586/","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"2021","dateOfInsertion":"13 November 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 October 2021","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"European Union\u2019s Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme under Marie Sk\u0142odowska-Curie Grant","grantNumber":"721732"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Sparse Automotive MIMO Radar for Super-Resolution Single Snapshot DOA Estimation With Mutual Coupling","sourcePdf":"access-amani-3122967-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.071299S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"9312710","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","xplore-issue":"9312710","articleId":"9585586","onlineDate":"26 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":9585608,"authors":[{"name":"Mohammad J.

A full characterization is established for the DI capacity of the discrete memoryless channel (DMC) with and without input constraints.

However, both the generation and the distribution of the maximally-entangled quantum states are inherently contaminated by quantum decoherence. Conventionally, the quantum decoherence is mitigated by performing the consecutive steps of quantum entanglement distillation followed by quantum teleportation. However, this conventional approach imposes a long delay. To circumvent this impediment, we propose a novel quantum communication scheme relying on realistic noisy pre-shared entanglement, which eliminates the sequential steps imposing delay in the standard approach. More precisely, our proposed scheme can be viewed as a direct quantum communication scheme capable of improving the quantum bit error ratio (QBER) of the logical qubits despite relying on realistic noisy pre-shared entanglement. Our performance analysis shows that the proposed scheme offers competitive QBER, yield, and goodput compared to the existing state-of-the-art quantum communication schemes, despite requiring fewer quantum gates.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2021.3122786","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2021.3122786","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9681827","startPage":"469","endPage":"484","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/9681827/09585609.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9585609","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Quantum entanglement","Qubit","Noise measurement","Quantum communication","Quantum channels","Quantum state","Internet"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Quantum communication","quantum entanglement","quantum error-correction","quantum stabilizer codes","Quantum Internet"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Direct Quantum Communications in the Presence of Realistic Noisy Entanglement","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2022","isJournal":true,"volume":"70","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2022","dateOfInsertion":"14 January 2022","htmlLink":"/document/9585609/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 October 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9585609/","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"project \u201cTowards the Quantum Internet: A Multidisciplinary Effort,\u201d University of Naples Federico II"},{"fundingName":"PON project \u201cS4E - Sistemi di Sicurezza e Protezione per l\u2019Ambiente Mare.\u201d"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000266","fundingName":"Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council projects","grantNumber":"EP/P034284/1 and EP/P003990/1 (COALESCE)"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000781","fundingName":"European Research Council\u2019s Advanced Fellow Grant QuantCom","grantNumber":"789028"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Direct Quantum Communications in the Presence of Realistic Noisy Entanglement","sourcePdf":"tcomm-hanzo-3122786-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.111543S","chronDate":"Jan.  2022","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"9681827","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","xplore-issue":"9681827","articleId":"9585609","onlineDate":"26 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2022","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-23"},{"_id":9585614,"authors":[{"name":"Muhammad Usman Sana","affiliation":["College of Computer Science and Technology, Xi\u2019an University of Science and Technology, Xi\u2019an, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/9312710/9585614/sana-3122938-small.gif","p":["Muhammad Usman Sana received the B.E. degree in information technology from the University of Engineering and Technology, Taxila, Pakistan, in 2006, and the M.S. degree in communication engineering from the Chalmers University of Technology, Sweden, in 2010.

Cloud computing has lots of features, e.g. virtualization, multi-user, efficiency, cost savings, and most importantly security. Machine learning approaches based on neural networks are being widely applied in cloud infrastructure when training is performed however this may produce possible privacy and security risk as direct access to raw data is required. To address this problem, we propose a new security design using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and encryption to confirm a safe communication system in the cloud environment, by letting the third parties access the data in an encrypted form for processing without disclosing the data of the provider party to secure important information. In this paper, to train neural networks using encrypted data we considered the Matrix Operation-based Randomization and Encipherment (MORE) technique, based on Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE). This technique allows the computations to be performed directly on floating-point data within a neural network with a minor computational overhead. We examined the speech and voice recognition problem and the performance of the proposed method has been validated in MATLAB simulation. Results showed that applying neural network training with MORE offers improved accuracy, runtime, and performance. These results highlight the potential of the proposed method to protect privacy and provide high accuracy in a reasonable amount of time when compared to other state-of-the-art techniques.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3122938","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/9312710/09585614.pdf","startPage":"145785","endPage":"145799","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3122938","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9312710","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Enhanced Security in Cloud Computing Using Neural Network and Encryption","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9585614/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 October 2021","displayDocTitle":"Enhanced Security in Cloud Computing Using Neural Network and Encryption","volume":"9","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"13 November 2021","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"2021","htmlLink":"/document/9585614/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Natural Science Basic Research Plan in Shaanxi Province of China","grantNumber":"2019JM-348"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Enhanced Security in Cloud Computing Using Neural Network and Encryption","sourcePdf":"access-sana-3122938-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.092273S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"9312710","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","xplore-issue":"9312710","articleId":"9585614","onlineDate":"26 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":9585619,"authors":[{"name":"Manar M.

It is a common practice to leave out those diacritics in written Arabic. Most Arabic electronic texts lack such diacritics. The processing of those texts for various purposes of Natural Language Processing is a complicated task. Diacritized words are necessary for applications such as machine translation, sentiment analysis, and speech synthesis. To address this problem, several studies proposed automatic systems to restore diacritics in Arabic texts. The present paper presents an in-depth survey of 56 most recent Arabic diacritization studies. Based on the diacritization approach, the studies are grouped into four sections in terms of method; rule-based, simple statistical, hybrid, and Neural Networks. While rule-based methods such as morphological analyzers and lexicon retrievals were the earliest approaches, results indicated that they are still valuable tools that can aid in the process of diacritization. Effective statistical methods that produced diacritics with acceptable accuracy include Hidden Markov Model, n-grams, and Support Vector Machines. They are often accompanied by either rule-based or neural networks in hybrid systems. Neural networks, specifically Bidirectional Long Short Term Memory, reached very high diacritization accuracy levels. Studies employing neural networks focused on evaluating and comparing the efficacy of several types of neural networks or a hybrid of them, testing alternatives of input units or suggested schemes for partial daicritization. The study synthesizes the results of the studies, identifies research gaps, and offers recommendations for future research.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3122977","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/9312710/09585619.pdf","startPage":"145012","endPage":"145032","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3122977","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9312710","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Automatic Methods and Neural Networks in Arabic Texts Diacritization: A Comprehensive Survey","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9585619/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 October 2021","displayDocTitle":"Automatic Methods and Neural Networks in Arabic Texts Diacritization: A Comprehensive Survey","volume":"9","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"13 November 2021","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"2021","htmlLink":"/document/9585619/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Automatic Methods and Neural Networks in Arabic Texts Diacritization: A Comprehensive Survey","sourcePdf":"access-almanea-3122977-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.111287S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"9312710","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","xplore-issue":"9312710","articleId":"9585619","onlineDate":"26 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":9585635,"authors":[{"name":"Jian Wang","affiliation":["National Laboratory of Radar Signal Processing, Xidian University, Xi'an, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4609443/9314330/9585635/wang-3122461-small.gif","p":["Jian Wang received the B.S. degree in electronic information science and technology from the North University of China, Taiyuan, China, in 2015.

In this article, we develop a novel deep learning-based semisupervised method to address these challenges. The method first incorporates a pixel-wise log-ratio difference image (DI) and its saliency map to produce a spatially enhanced (SE) DI using a reweighting scheme based on the fact that changed pixels exhibit higher saliency than unchanged pixels. As a result, prominent changed regions are highlighted, and the class separability is significantly increased. We construct pixel-wise and context-wise features based on the log-ratio DI and SE DI, which respectively provide image detail cue and spatial context cue, as dual input features to jointly characterize the change information at each pixel position. Second, we propose a label-consistent self-ensemble network (LCS-EnsemNet), which can take advantage of the unlabeled samples to learn discriminative high-level features for the precise identification of changed pixels. By enforcing a label consistency between dual features and a label consistency across multiple classifiers, the label-consistent self-ensemble strategy enables the proposed network to selectively transform unlabeled samples into pseudo-labeled samples in an unsupervised manner and ensures that the selected pseudo-labels are reliably and stably predicted. Finally, the cross-entropy loss is calculated with the limited labeled data and selected pseudo-labeled samples to optimize the LCS-EnsemNet in a supervised way. The proposed method is evaluated on three low/medium-resolution SAR datasets and one high-resolution SAR dataset, and experimental results have demonstrated its efficiency and effectiveness.","doi":"10.1109/JSTARS.2021.3122461","startPage":"11903","endPage":"11925","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel7/4609443/9314330/09585635.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSTARS.2021.3122461","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9314330","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"LCS-EnsemNet: A Semisupervised Deep Neural Network for SAR Image Change Detection With Dual Feature Extraction and Label-Consistent Self-Ensemble","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radar polarimetry","Training","Synthetic aperture radar","Feature extraction","Speckle","Clustering algorithms","Classification algorithms"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Change detection (CD)","deep neural network (DNN)","label-consistent self-ensemble","semisupervised learning (SSL)","spatially enhanced (SE) difference image (DI)","synthetic aperture radar (SAR)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9585635/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 October 2021","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","displayDocTitle":"LCS-EnsemNet: A Semisupervised Deep Neural Network for SAR Image Change Detection With Dual Feature Extraction and Label-Consistent Self-Ensemble","volume":"14","htmlLink":"/document/9585635/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"2021","dateOfInsertion":"03 December 2021","isOpenAccess":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61671354"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100013314","fundingName":"Higher Education Discipline Innovation Project"},{"fundingName":"Shaanxi Innovation Team Project"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"LCS-EnsemNet: A Semisupervised Deep Neural Network for SAR Image Change Detection With Dual Feature Extraction and Label-Consistent Self-Ensemble","sourcePdf":"jstars-wang-3122461-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.163162S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"4609443","isNumber":"9314330","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4609443","xplore-issue":"9314330","articleId":"9585635","onlineDate":"26 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBYNCND","lastupdate":"2021-12-07"},{"_id":9585641,"authors":[{"name":"Bo Hu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA"],"firstName":"Bo","lastName":"Hu","orcid":"0000-0002-7939-1117"},{"name":"Jos\u00e9 C.

In this paper, we present a novel regression framework based on a special case of the maximal correlation using the correlation ratio to train a Multiple-input Multiple-output (MIMO) model called the Bank of Wiener Models (BWM). Nonlinear time series modeling under maximal correlation unifies the cost and the mapping function under the same mathematical optimization framework. This provides direct optimality (maximal statistical dependence) between BWM model outputs and the desired response, without the restriction of constructing an error signal as conventionally done in regression. Based on the idea of correlation ratio, we propose the Maximal Correlation Algorithm (MCA), which approximates directly the correlation ratio between BWM outputs and the desired response. As an important consequence, MCA modularizes the training of models with hidden layers and avoids the end-to-end training of backpropagation (BP), while improving the equivalent mapping capability. We further propose several possible multi layer arrangements to create deep networks trained with MCA. We demonstrate experimentally that MCA performs at the same level of output error or better when compared to a single and multiple-hidden-layer MLP trained with BP and the Mean Squared Error (MSE). We also show that the system identification capabilities of MCA are superior to MLPs trained with BP. Hence, MCA has great promise in both nonlinear system identification and machine learning.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9585641/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 October 2021","volume":"69","publicationDate":"2021","htmlLink":"/document/9585641/","dateOfInsertion":"11 November 2021","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"MIMO Modeling by Learning Explicitly the Projection Space: The Maximum Correlation Ratio Cost Function","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000185","fundingName":"Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency","grantNumber":"FA9453-18-1-0039"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000006","fundingName":"Office of Naval Research","grantNumber":"N00014-18-1-2306 and N00014-21-1-2345"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MIMO Modeling by Learning Explicitly the Projection Space: The Maximum Correlation Ratio Cost Function","sourcePdf":"tsp-hu-3122306-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.145999S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"9307529","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","xplore-issue":"9307529","articleId":"9585641","onlineDate":"26 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-11"},{"_id":9585645,"authors":[{"name":"Charles Jeon","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, USA","Apple Inc., San Diego, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/9307529/9585645/jeon-3121634-small.gif","p":["Charles Jeon (Student Member, IEEE) received the B.S.\u00a0degree in electrical engineering and mathematics in 2013, and the M.S.\u00a0degree in electrical engineering both from the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA.

Via a simulated database of 150 BSPAs, a DNN model is constructed on a 5-layer system using an adaptive learning rate algorithm. The framework and hyper-parameters of the DNN model are optimized in the training phase of a hybrid algorithm combining strengths of both particle swarm optimization (PSO) and a modified version of the gravitational search algorithm (MGSA-PSO). To generate the database for training and testing the model, 150 BSPAs with different geometrical are simulated in terms of the resonant frequency using a precise electromagnetic analysis platform. A fabricated BSPA operating at 28 GHz and 38 GHz is used to test and verify the DNN model. Then, the application of DNN with back-propagation algorithm and weighted MGSA-PSO algorithm is used for beam-steering the main beam pattern of the designed uniform circular antenna array with side-lobe level <= \u221230 dB by estimating the appropriate feeding phases of the 16 elements. Several illustrative examples are placed to beam-steer the pattern in the desired direction to check the validity of the technique.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Antenna arrays","Antenna radiation patterns","Computational modeling","Antennas","Indexes","Signal processing algorithms","Phased arrays"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Deep learning","artificial neural network","optimization algorithm","mm-wave antennas","circular polarization","beamforming technique"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3123219","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/9312710/09585682.pdf","startPage":"145583","endPage":"145591","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9312710","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3123219","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Deep Learning Based Antenna Design and Beam-Steering Capabilities for Millimeter-Wave Applications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9585682","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Deep Learning Based Antenna Design and Beam-Steering Capabilities for Millimeter-Wave Applications","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9585682/","volume":"9","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"2021","htmlLink":"/document/9585682/","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"13 November 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 October 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Deep Learning Based Antenna Design and Beam-Steering Capabilities for Millimeter-Wave Applications","sourcePdf":"access-mahmoud-3123219-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.148211S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"9312710","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","xplore-issue":"9312710","articleId":"9585682","onlineDate":"26 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-12-26"},{"_id":9585683,"authors":[{"name":"Pham Duy Thanh","affiliation":["Electronic and Computer Engineering, University of Ulsan (UOU), Ulsan, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/9312710/9585683/thanh-3123213-small.gif","p":["Pham Duy Thanh received the B.E. degree in electronics and telecommunications engineering from Ton Duc Thang University, Vietnam, in 2013, the M.S. degree from the Graduate Institute of Digital Mechatronic Technology, College of Engineering, Chinese Culture University, Taiwan, in 2015, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical, electronic and computer engineering from the University of Ulsan, South Korea, in 2021.

Secret sharing schemes for multipartite access structures have received considerable attention due to the fact that multipartite secret sharing can be seen as a natural and useful generalization of threshold secret sharing. This work deals with efficient and explicit constructions of ideal multipartite secret sharing schemes. Most ideal multipartite secret sharing schemes in the literature can be classified as either hierarchical or compartmented. The main results are the constructions for ideal hierarchical access structures, a family that contains every ideal hierarchical access structure as a particular case such as the disjunctive hierarchical threshold access structure and the conjunctive hierarchical threshold access structure, the constructions for three families of compartmented access structures, and the constructions for two families compartmented access structures with compartments. We present an efficient method to construct ideal linear schemes realizing these access structures by linear algebraic techniques on the basis of the relationship between multipartite secret sharing schemes, polymatroids and matroids.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2022","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9585712/","volume":"68","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/9585712/","publicationDate":"Jan. 2022","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2021","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 October 2021","displayDocTitle":"Efficient Explicit Constructions of Multipartite Secret Sharing Schemes","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"City School Joint Funding Project of Guangzhou City","grantNumber":"202102010377"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"Foundation of National Natural Science of China","grantNumber":"62132018, 61772147 and 12171114"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100012166","fundingName":"National Key Research and Development Program of China","grantNumber":"2020YFA0712500"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100010226","fundingName":"Department of Education of Guangdong Province","grantNumber":"2016KZDXM036"},{"fundingName":"Open Subject Project of State Key Laboratory of Cryptography Science and Technology","grantNumber":"MMKFKT201913"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient Explicit Constructions of Multipartite Secret Sharing Schemes","sourcePdf":"tit-chen-3123102-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.23236S","chronDate":"Jan.  2022","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"9660615","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","xplore-issue":"9660615","articleId":"9585712","onlineDate":"26 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2022","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-23"},{"_id":9585716,"authors":[{"name":"Anicetus Odo","affiliation":["School of Science and Engineering, University of Dundee, Dundee, U.K."],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/9312710/9585716/odo-3123158-small.gif","p":["Anicetus Odo received the B.Eng. degree in computer science and engineering from the Enugu State University of Science and Technology, Enugu State, Nigeria, in 2001, and the M.Eng. degree in electronics and computer engineering from Nnamdi Azikiwe University, Anambra, Nigeria, in 2009.

Due to the significant number, variety and distribution of electrical network overhead line assets, energy network operators spend millions annually on inspection and maintenance programmes. Currently, inspection involves acquiring and manually analysing aerial images. This is labour intensive and subjective. Along with costs associated with helicopter or drone operations, data analysis represents a significant financial burden to network operators. We propose an approach to automating assessment of the condition of electrical towers. Importantly, we train machine learning tower classifiers without using condition labels for individual components of interest. Instead, learning is supervised using only condition labels for towers in their entirety. This enables us to use a real-world industry dataset without needing costly additional human labelling of thousands of individual components. Our prototype first detects instances of components in multiple images of each tower, using Mask R-CNN or RetinaNet. It then predicts tower condition ratings using one of two approaches: (i) component instance classifiers trained using class labels transferred from towers to each of their detected component instances, or (ii) multiple instance learning classifiers based on bags of detected instances. Instance or bag class predictions are aggregated to obtain tower condition ratings. Evaluation used a dataset with representative tower images and associated condition ratings covering a range of component types, scenes, environmental conditions, and viewpoints. We report experiments investigating classification of towers based on the condition of their multiple insulator and U-bolt components. Insulators and their U-bolts were detected with average precision of 96.7 and 97.9, respectively. Tower classification achieved areas under ROC curves of 0.94 and 0.98 for insulator condition and U-bolt condition ratings, respectively. Thus we demonstrate that tower condition classifiers can be trained effectively without labelling the condition of individual components.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9312710","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3123158","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/9312710/09585716.pdf","startPage":"146281","endPage":"146295","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3123158","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Aerial Image Analysis Using Deep Learning for Electrical Overhead Line Network Asset Management","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","displayDocTitle":"Aerial Image Analysis Using Deep Learning for Electrical Overhead Line Network Asset Management","volume":"9","htmlLink":"/document/9585716/","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"2021","dateOfInsertion":"13 November 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9585716/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 October 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100008895","fundingName":"Tertiary Education Trust Fund (TETFund) of Nigeria"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000266","fundingName":"Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) National Centre for Energy System Integration Project","grantNumber":"EP/P001173/1"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Aerial Image Analysis Using Deep Learning for Electrical Overhead Line Network Asset Management","sourcePdf":"access-mckenna-3123158-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.172336S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"9312710","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","xplore-issue":"9312710","articleId":"9585716","onlineDate":"26 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-12-26"},{"_id":9585722,"authors":[{"name":"Hao Zhang","affiliation":["College of Information Science and Technology, Jinan University, Guangzhou, China","Guangdong Key Laboratory of Data Security and Privacy Preserving, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Hao","lastName":"Zhang"},{"name":"Shancheng Zhao","affiliation":["College of Information Science and Technology, Jinan University, Guangzhou, China","Guangdong Key Laboratory of Data Security and Privacy Preserving, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Shancheng","lastName":"Zhao","orcid":"0000-0002-0544-8416"},{"name":"Duoying Zhang","affiliation":["College of Information Science and Technology, Jinan University, Guangzhou, China","Guangdong Key Laboratory of Data Security and Privacy Preserving, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Duoying","lastName":"Zhang","orcid":"0000-0001-9863-0868"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"9585722","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":81},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Codes","Visible light communication","Modulation","Lighting","Light emitting diodes","Costs","Bit error rate"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Dimmable visible light communication (VLC)","light emitting diode (LED)","pulse amplitude modulation"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9585722","abstract":"In visible light communications (VLC), the bulbs are used to provide communication and illumination simultaneously. Therefore, it is important to design modulation schemes, which are capable of adjusting the illumination level. The simplest approach to achieve this is compensating an all-one or an all-zero sequence, which however is spectrally inefficient. In this letter, we propose to use the constant sum codes to construct spectral-efficient dimmable pulse amplitude modulation (PAM) for VLC. We also present an efficient algorithm based on graph expanding to design the mapping for the proposed dimmable PAM. Numerical results show that the spectral efficiencies of the proposed dimmable PAM are higher than those of the state-of-the-arts. Numerical results also show that the proposed dimmable PAM performs better than the state-of-the-arts in coded VLC. These results show the potential advantages of the proposed dimmable PAM.","doi":"10.1109/LCOMM.2021.3123145","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCOMM.2021.3123145","startPage":"118","endPage":"122","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/4234/9674048/09585722.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9674048","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spectral-Efficient PAM Modulations for Dimmable Visible Light Communication Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 October 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2022","displayDocTitle":"Spectral-Efficient PAM Modulations for Dimmable Visible Light Communication Systems","publicationDate":"Jan. 2022","dateOfInsertion":"07 January 2022","volume":"26","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9585722/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9585722/","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"NSF of China","grantNumber":"61871201"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100020084","fundingName":"Basic Research Program of Guangzhou Municipal Science and Technology Bureau","grantNumber":"202102020872"},{"fundingName":"Guangdong Provincial NSF","grantNumber":"2021A1515011906 and 2017A030313371"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spectral-Efficient PAM Modulations for Dimmable Visible Light Communication Systems","sourcePdf":"lcomm-zhang-3123145-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.054893S","chronDate":"Jan.  2022","xplore-pub-id":"4234","isNumber":"9674048","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4234","xplore-issue":"9674048","articleId":"9585722","onlineDate":"26 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2022","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-10"},{"_id":9585723,"authors":[{"name":"Uzi Pereg","affiliation":["Institute for Communications Engineering, Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen, Munich, Germany"],"bio":{"p":["Uzi Pereg (Member, IEEE) received the B.Sc.

Hybrid analog-digital structure has been applied in massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems for reducing the cost in millimeter-wave communications. However, the SCM cannot be obtained because the received signals at the antennas are unavailable to the digital receiver in hybrid massive MIMO systems. Based on our previous work, we will present an adaptive reconstruction approach in this paper where the SCM can be derived iteratively using the stochastic gradient descent algorithm. In this way, direct matrix inverse can be avoided so that the computational complexity for SCM reconstruction can be reduced significantly. Converge analyzes and numerical simulations are carried out to demonstrate the advantageous performance of the adaptive reconstruction approach.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3122810","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3122810","startPage":"145060","endPage":"145065","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/9312710/09585727.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9312710","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Reconstruction for Spatial Covariance Matrix in Hybrid Massive MIMO Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 October 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Reconstruction for Spatial Covariance Matrix in Hybrid Massive MIMO Systems","publicationDate":"2021","dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2021","volume":"9","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9585727/","isOpenAccess":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9585727/","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100012166","fundingName":"National Key Research and Development Program of China","grantNumber":"2020YFB1804901"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100012226","fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"2020JBM085 and 2020JBZD005"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100005023","fundingName":"State Key Laboratory of Rail Traffic Control and Safety, Beijing Jiaotong University","grantNumber":"RCS2020ZT009"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100019085","fundingName":"Chongqing Municipal Key Laboratory of Institutions of Higher Education"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Adaptive Reconstruction for Spatial Covariance Matrix in Hybrid Massive MIMO Systems","sourcePdf":"access-yan-3122810-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.074917S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"9312710","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","xplore-issue":"9312710","articleId":"9585727","onlineDate":"26 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-12-26"},{"_id":9585805,"authors":[{"name":"Mark Roman Miller","affiliation":["Stanford University, Stanford, California, USA"],"firstName":"Mark","lastName":"Roman Miller","id":"37089017124"},{"name":"Hanseul Jun","affiliation":["Stanford University, Stanford, California, USA"],"firstName":"Hanseul","lastName":"Jun","id":"37088397753"},{"name":"Jeremy N.

The tracking component of virtual reality systems captures data on nonverbal behavior both covertly and continuously at high spatial and temporal fidelity, enabling what is called behavioral tracing. With previous research analyzing this type of data, however, inference has primarily been limited to linear relationships of subject-level aggregates. In this work, we suggest these rough aggregations are often neither the best according to theory nor do they make use of the rich data available from behaviorally traced experiments. We also explore the relationships between motion and subjective experiences with a previously published dataset of 360-degree video and emotion, and we find evidence for nonlinear sample-level relationships. In particular, reported valence relates with head pitch and pitch velocity, among others, and reported arousal relates with head rotation speed and yaw velocity, among others. The role of these sample-level nonlinear relationships for future work are discussed.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Human computer interaction","Solid modeling","Analytical models","Tracking","Aggregates","Psychology","Data visualization"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["virtual reality","behavior tracing","methodology","nonlinear analyses"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ISMAR-Adjunct54149.2021.00039","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Symposium on Mixed and Augmented Reality Adjunct (ISMAR-Adjunct)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Symposium on Mixed and Augmented Reality Adjunct (ISMAR-Adjunct)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9585620/9585774/09585805.pdf","startPage":"147","endPage":"152","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9585774","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISMAR-Adjunct54149.2021.00039","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Motion and Meaning: Sample-Level Nonlinear Analyses of Virtual Reality Tracking Data","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9585805","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Motion and Meaning: Sample-Level Nonlinear Analyses of Virtual Reality Tracking Data","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9585805/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9585805/","conferenceDate":"4-8 Oct. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"13 November 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-8 Oct. 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Motion and Meaning: Sample-Level Nonlinear Analyses of Virtual Reality Tracking Data","confLoc":"Bari, Italy","sourcePdf":"129800a147.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05897S","chronDate":"4-8 Oct. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9585620","isNumber":"9585774","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9585620","xplore-issue":"9585774","articleId":"9585805","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-26"},{"_id":9585907,"authors":[{"name":"Abderrahmane Abbes","affiliation":["University of Jordan, Amman, Jordan"],"firstName":"Abderrahmane","lastName":"Abbes","id":"37089012410"},{"name":"Adel Ouannas","affiliation":["University of Larbi Ben Mhidi, Algeria"],"firstName":"Adel","lastName":"Ouannas","id":"37085997955"},{"name":"Nabil Shawagfeh","affiliation":["University of Jordan, Amman, Jordan"],"firstName":"Nabil","lastName":"Shawagfeh","id":"37088407661"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4171-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4172-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9585907","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":14},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Three-dimensional displays","Neural networks","Numerical simulation","Control systems","Mathematical models","Synchronization","Informatics"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Neural networks","fractional calculus","synchro-nization"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9585907","abstract":"This work studies the synchronization of the fractional order discrete neural networks based on h-fractional difference operator.

However, standard NNs are unable to capture their model uncertainty which is crucial for many safety-critical applications including healthcare and autonomous vehicles. In comparison, Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) are able to express uncertainty in their prediction via a mathematical grounding. Nevertheless, BNNs have not been as widely used in industrial practice, mainly because of their expensive computational cost and limited hardware performance. This work proposes a novel FPGA based hardware architecture to accelerate BNNs inferred through Monte Carlo Dropout. Compared with other state-of-the-art BNN accelerators, the proposed accelerator can achieve up to 4 times higher energy efficiency and 9 times better compute efficiency. Considering partial Bayesian inference, an automatic framework is proposed, which explores the trade-off between hardware and algorithmic performance. Extensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate that our proposed framework can effectively find the optimal points in the design space.","doi":"10.1109/DAC18074.2021.9586137","startPage":"1063","endPage":"1068","publicationTitle":"2021 58th ACM/IEEE Design Automation Conference (DAC)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DAC18074.2021.9586137","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9586083","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 58th ACM/IEEE Design Automation Conference (DAC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9585997/9586083/09586137.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High-Performance FPGA-based Accelerator for Bayesian Neural Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9586137/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"High-Performance FPGA-based Accelerator for Bayesian Neural Networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9586137/","publicationDate":"5 Dec. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"13 November 2021","conferenceDate":"5-9 Dec. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-9 Dec. 2021","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High-Performance FPGA-based Accelerator for Bayesian Neural Networks","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"178_RESEARCH0244.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057683S","chronDate":"5-9 Dec. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9585997","isNumber":"9586083","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9585997","xplore-issue":"9586083","articleId":"9586137","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":9586139,"authors":[{"name":"Ahmet F.

With rapidly developing technology and tight schedules, bringing automated solutions for sizing has attracted great attention. This paper presents DNN-Opt, a Reinforcement Learning (RL) inspired Deep Neural Network (DNN) based black-box optimization framework for analog circuit sizing. The key contributions of this paper are a novel sample-efficient two-stage deep learning optimization framework leveraging RL actor-critic algorithms, and a recipe to extend it on large industrial circuits using critical device identification. Our method shows 5\u201430x sample efficiency compared to other black-box optimization methods both on small building blocks and on large industrial circuits with better performance metrics. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first application of DNN-based circuit sizing on industrial scale circuits.","doi":"10.1109/DAC18074.2021.9586139","startPage":"1219","endPage":"1224","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 58th ACM/IEEE Design Automation Conference (DAC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9585997/9586083/09586139.pdf","publicationTitle":"2021 58th ACM/IEEE Design Automation Conference (DAC)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DAC18074.2021.9586139","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9586083","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"DNN-Opt: An RL Inspired Optimization for Analog Circuit Sizing using Deep Neural Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Deep learning","Measurement","Schedules","Neural networks","Optimization methods","Reinforcement learning","Manuals"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Analog Circuit Sizing Automation","Blackbox Optimization","Reinforcement Learning","Deep Neural Network"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9586139/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-9 Dec. 2021","displayDocTitle":"DNN-Opt: An RL Inspired Optimization for Analog Circuit Sizing using Deep Neural Networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9586139/","publicationDate":"5 Dec. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"13 November 2021","conferenceDate":"5-9 Dec. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"DNN-Opt: An RL Inspired Optimization for Analog Circuit Sizing using Deep Neural Networks","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"204_RESEARCH0261.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060891S","chronDate":"5-9 Dec. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9585997","isNumber":"9586083","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9585997","xplore-issue":"9586083","articleId":"9586139","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":9586161,"authors":[{"name":"Febin Sunny","affiliation":["Colorado State University, Fort Collins, CO, USA"],"firstName":"Febin","lastName":"Sunny","id":"37088479402"},{"name":"Asif Mirza","affiliation":["Colorado State University, Fort Collins, CO, USA"],"firstName":"Asif","lastName":"Mirza","id":"37088486156"},{"name":"Mahdi Nikdast","affiliation":["Colorado State University, Fort Collins, CO, USA"],"firstName":"Mahdi","lastName":"Nikdast","id":"37540539700"},{"name":"Sudeep Pasricha","affiliation":["Colorado State University, Fort Collins, CO, USA"],"firstName":"Sudeep","lastName":"Pasricha","id":"37265205600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3274-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3275-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"0738-100X"}],"articleNumber":"9586161","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":11},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9586161","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Performance evaluation","Neural networks","Thermal engineering","Power lasers","Crosstalk","Silicon photonics","Throughput"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["deep learning","neural networks","silicon photonics"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9586083","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 58th ACM/IEEE Design Automation Conference (DAC)","publicationTitle":"2021 58th ACM/IEEE Design Automation Conference (DAC)","doi":"10.1109/DAC18074.2021.9586161","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"CrossLight: A Cross-Layer Optimized Silicon Photonic Neural Network Accelerator","startPage":"1069","endPage":"1074","pdfPath":"/iel7/9585997/9586083/09586161.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DAC18074.2021.9586161","abstract":"Domain-specific neural network accelerators have seen growing interest in recent years due to their improved energy efficiency and performance compared to CPUs and GPUs.

In this work, we introduce Tunstall coding to compress the quantized weights. Tunstall coding can achieve high compression ratio as well as very fast decoding speed on various deep networks.

Moreover, its unsupervised training does not rely on expensive legacy layout data but only on sizing solutions. Experimental results show that the proposed model generates placement solutions at push-button speed and can generalize to circuit topologies and technological nodes not used in training.

An adversary can easily obtain the entire neural network (NN) model by physically snooping the memory bus that connects the accelerator chip with DRAM memory. Therefore, memory encryption becomes important for DL accelerators to improve their security. Nevertheless, we observe that traditional memory encryption techniques that have been efficiently used in CPU systems cause significant performance degradation when directly used in DL accelerators, due to the big bandwidth gap between the memory bus and the encryption engine. To address this problem, our paper proposes SEAL, a Secure and Efficient Accelerator scheme for deep Learning to enhance the performance of encrypted DL accelerators by improving the data access bandwidth. Specifically, SEAL leverages a criticality-aware smart encryption scheme that identifies partial data having no impact on the security of NN models and allows them to bypass the encryption engine, thus reducing the amount of data to be encrypted without affecting security. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that, compared with existing memory encryption techniques, SEAL achieves 1.34 \u2013 1.4\u00d7 overall performance improvement.","doi":"10.1109/DAC18074.2021.9586199","pdfPath":"/iel7/9585997/9586083/09586199.pdf","startPage":"1255","endPage":"1260","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 58th ACM/IEEE Design Automation Conference (DAC)","publicationTitle":"2021 58th ACM/IEEE Design Automation Conference (DAC)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DAC18074.2021.9586199","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9586083","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"SEALing Neural Network Models in Encrypted Deep Learning Accelerators","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9586199/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-9 Dec. 2021","displayDocTitle":"SEALing Neural Network Models in Encrypted Deep Learning Accelerators","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"13 November 2021","publicationDate":"5 Dec. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9586199/","conferenceDate":"5-9 Dec. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100010002","fundingName":"Ministry of Education"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SEALing Neural Network Models in Encrypted Deep Learning Accelerators","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"210_RESEARCH0431.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.08638S","chronDate":"5-9 Dec. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9585997","isNumber":"9586083","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9585997","xplore-issue":"9586083","articleId":"9586199","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":9586204,"authors":[{"name":"Yingjie Li","affiliation":["University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT, USA"],"firstName":"Yingjie","lastName":"Li","id":"37089026976"},{"name":"Cunxi Yu","affiliation":["University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT, USA"],"firstName":"Cunxi","lastName":"Yu","id":"37088564280"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3274-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3275-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"0738-100X"}],"articleNumber":"9586204","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":12},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Deep learning","Optical diffraction","Phase modulation","Artificial neural networks","Optical computing","Optical fiber networks","Robustness"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Optical neural networks","security","adversarial learning"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9586204","abstract":"Diffractive Deep Neural Network $(\\mathrm{D}^{2}$ NN) can work as a neural network with the diffraction of light and have demonstrated orders of magnitude performance improvements in computation speed and energy efficiency [1], [2].

This paper presents a novel graph-learning-based framework leveraging unsupervised learning to recognize circuit matching structures by making the most of numerous unlabeled circuits.

With Korhonen equations, EM assessment for VLSI circuits remains challenged due to the increasing integrated density. VLSI multisegment interconnect trees can be naturally viewed as graphs. Based on this observation, we propose a new graph convolution network (GCN) model, which is called EMGraph considering both node and edge embedding features, to estimate the transient EM stress of interconnect trees. Compared with recently proposed generative adversarial network (GAN) based stress image-generation method, EMGraph model can learn more transferable knowledge to predict stress distributions on new graphs without retraining via inductive learning. Trained on the large dataset, the model shows less than 1.5% averaged error compared to the ground truth results and is orders of magnitude faster than both COMSOL and state-of-the-art method. It also achieves smaller model size, $4\\times$ accuracy and $14\\times$ speedup over the GAN-based method.","doi":"10.1109/DAC18074.2021.9586239","startPage":"919","endPage":"924","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 58th ACM/IEEE Design Automation Conference (DAC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9585997/9586083/09586239.pdf","publicationTitle":"2021 58th ACM/IEEE Design Automation Conference (DAC)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DAC18074.2021.9586239","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9586083","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"EMGraph: Fast Learning-Based Electromigration Analysis for Multi-Segment Interconnect Using Graph Convolution Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Electromigration","Convolution","Image edge detection","Integrated circuit interconnections","Very large scale integration","Predictive models","Generative adversarial networks"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Electromigration (EM)","graph convolution network (GCN)","multisegment interconnect","hydrostatic stress assessment"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9586239/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-9 Dec. 2021","displayDocTitle":"EMGraph: Fast Learning-Based Electromigration Analysis for Multi-Segment Interconnect Using Graph Convolution Networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9586239/","publicationDate":"5 Dec. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"13 November 2021","conferenceDate":"5-9 Dec. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"EMGraph: Fast Learning-Based Electromigration Analysis for Multi-Segment Interconnect Using Graph Convolution Networks","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"154_RESEARCH1128.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.079594S","chronDate":"5-9 Dec. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9585997","isNumber":"9586083","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9585997","xplore-issue":"9586083","articleId":"9586239","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":9586260,"authors":[{"name":"Salim Ullah","affiliation":["Center for Advancing Electronics Dresden (CfAED), Technische Universitat Dresden, Germany"],"firstName":"Salim","lastName":"Ullah","id":"37086372671"},{"name":"Siva Satyendra Sahoo","affiliation":["Center for Advancing Electronics Dresden (CfAED), Technische Universitat Dresden, Germany"],"firstName":"Siva Satyendra","lastName":"Sahoo","id":"37085804382"},{"name":"Akash Kumar","affiliation":["Center for Advancing Electronics Dresden (CfAED), Technische Universitat Dresden, Germany"],"firstName":"Akash","lastName":"Kumar","id":"37292250700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3274-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3275-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"0738-100X"}],"articleNumber":"9586260","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":80},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computational modeling","Approximate computing","Machine learning","Tools","Predictive models","Parallel processing","Table lookup"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Approximate Computing","Embedded Systems","Cross-layer System Design","FPGA","High-level Synthesis"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9586260","abstract":"With the rising variation and complexity of embedded work-loads, FPGA-based systems are being increasingly used for many applications.

In recent years, Approximate Computing has emerged as a viable tool for improving the performance by utilizing reduced precision data structures and resource-optimized high-performance arithmetic operators. However, most of the related state-of-the-art research has mainly focused on utilizing approximate computing principles individually on different layers of the computing stack. Nonetheless, approximations across different layers of computing stack can substantially enhance the system\u2019s performance. To this end, we present a framework to enable the intelligent exploration and highly accurate identification of the feasible design points in the large design space enabled by cross-layer approximations.

We present a technique, named as TCL, to alleviate the trade-off problem, enabling the accuracy of 73.87% (VGG-16) and 70.37% (ResNet-34) for ImageNet with the moderate latency of 250 cycles in SNNs.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9586266/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-9 Dec. 2021","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"5-9 Dec. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9586266/","dateOfInsertion":"13 November 2021","publicationDate":"5 Dec. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"TCL: an ANN-to-SNN Conversion with Trainable Clipping Layers","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003725","fundingName":"National Research Foundation of Korea"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"TCL: an ANN-to-SNN Conversion with Trainable Clipping Layers","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"133_RESEARCH0423.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056131S","chronDate":"5-9 Dec. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9585997","isNumber":"9586083","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9585997","xplore-issue":"9586083","articleId":"9586266","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-26"},{"_id":9586281,"authors":[{"name":"Rachmad Vidya Wicaksana Putra","affiliation":["Technische Universit\u00e4t Wien (TU Wien), Vienna, Austria"],"firstName":"Rachmad Vidya Wicaksana","lastName":"Putra","id":"37073430600"},{"name":"Muhammad Shafique","affiliation":["New York University Abu Dhabi (NYUAD), Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates"],"firstName":"Muhammad","lastName":"Shafique","id":"37408660000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3274-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3275-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"0738-100X"}],"articleNumber":"9586281","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":24},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Energy consumption","Analytical models","Adaptation models","Heuristic algorithms","Energy efficiency","Inference algorithms"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Spiking neural networks","SNNs","continual learning","unsupervised learning","energy-efficiency","embedded systems","complexity."]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"SpikeDyn: A Framework for Energy-Efficient Spiking Neural Networks with Continual and Unsupervised Learning Capabilities in Dynamic Environments","abstract":"Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) bear the potential of efficient unsupervised and continual learning capabilities because of their biological plausibility, but their complexity still poses a serious research challenge to enable their energy-efficient design for resource-constrained scenarios (like embedded systems, IoT-Edge, etc.). We propose SpikeDyn, a comprehensive framework for energy-efficient SNNs with continual and unsupervised learning capabilities in dynamic environments, for both the training and inference phases. It is achieved through the following multiple diverse mechanisms: 1) reduction of neuronal operations, by replacing the inhibitory neurons with direct lateral inhibitions; 2) a memory- and energy-constrained SNN model search algorithm that employs analytical models to estimate the memory footprint and energy consumption of different candidate SNN models and selects a Pareto-optimal SNN model; and 3) a lightweight continual and unsupervised learning algorithm that employs adaptive learning rates, adaptive membrane threshold potential, weight decay, and reduction of spurious updates. Our experimental results show that, for a network with 400 excitatory neurons, our SpikeDyn reduces the energy consumption on average by 51% for training and by 37% for inference, as compared to the state-of-the-art. Due to the improved learning algorithm, SpikeDyn provides on avg. 21% accuracy improvement over the state-of-the-art, for classifying the most recently learned task, and by 8% on average for the previously learned tasks.","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9586281","publicationTitle":"2021 58th ACM/IEEE Design Automation Conference (DAC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 58th ACM/IEEE Design Automation Conference (DAC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9585997/9586083/09586281.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9586083","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DAC18074.2021.9586281","startPage":"1057","endPage":"1062","doi":"10.1109/DAC18074.2021.9586281","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9586281/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-9 Dec. 2021","displayDocTitle":"SpikeDyn: A Framework for Energy-Efficient Spiking Neural Networks with Continual and Unsupervised Learning Capabilities in Dynamic Environments","isDynamicHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"13 November 2021","conferenceDate":"5-9 Dec. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9586281/","publicationDate":"5 Dec. 2021","isConference":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100005045","fundingName":"Ministry of Finance"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100006505","fundingName":"Swiss Re"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100018859","fundingName":"Tamkeen"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SpikeDyn: A Framework for Energy-Efficient Spiking Neural Networks with Continual and Unsupervised Learning Capabilities in Dynamic Environments","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"177_RESEARCH1152.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07158S","chronDate":"5-9 Dec. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9585997","isNumber":"9586083","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9585997","xplore-issue":"9586083","articleId":"9586281","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-10"},{"_id":9586290,"authors":[{"name":"Omid Aramoon","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering, Institute for Systems Research, University of Maryland, College Park, USA"],"firstName":"Omid","lastName":"Aramoon","id":"37086342819"},{"name":"Pin-Yu Chen","affiliation":["IBM Thomas J.

Static random-access memory (SRAM) has been demonstrated as a mature candidate for CIM accelerator for deep neural networks (DNNs) due to its availability in advanced technology nodes. However, as SRAM is volatile and could not hold weight after power down, the necessity for downloading models from the cloud to inference engine causes potential threats such as model leaking. Also, saving raw weights of the DNN model stationary in the memory cells will increase the vulnerabilities. This work aims at developing a secure inference engine with a lightweight yet effective countermeasure to protect the DNN models in SRAM-based CIM architecture. We propose a secure XOR-CIM engine with a modified reverse secure sketch protocol to enable on-chip authentication and key processing for XOR-based stream cipher encrypted models. In the XOR-CIM core, we modify the six-transistor SRAM bit cell with dual wordlines to implement XOR decryption without sacrificing the parallel computation\u2019s efficiency. The evaluations at 28 nm show that the XOR-CIM could enhance security, achieving comparable energy efficiency and no throughput loss, with negligible area overhead compared with the normal-CIM design without encryption.","doi":"10.1109/TVLSI.2021.3120296","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/92/9627316/09586555.pdf","startPage":"2027","endPage":"2039","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9627316","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVLSI.2021.3120296","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9586555","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 October 2021","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9586555/","displayDocTitle":"Secure XOR-CIM Engine: Compute-In-Memory SRAM Architecture With Embedded XOR Encryption","volume":"29","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 2021","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9586555/","dateOfInsertion":"25 November 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Secure XOR-CIM Engine: Compute-In-Memory SRAM Architecture With Embedded XOR Encryption","sourcePdf":"tvlsi-huang-3120296-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.082584S","chronDate":"Dec.  2021","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"9627316","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","xplore-issue":"9627316","articleId":"9586555","onlineDate":"26 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-30"},{"_id":9586560,"authors":[{"name":"Soner Se\u00e7kiner","affiliation":["University of Rochester, Rochester, NY, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/92/9627316/9586560/secki-3115420-small.gif","p":["Soner Se\u00e7kiner received the B.S. degree in electrical and electronics engineering and the B.S. and M.S. degrees in civil engineering from Middle East Technical University, Ankara, Turkey, in 2008, 2011, and 2017, respectively.

Side-channel attacks have been demonstrated to be one of the primary threats for the security and privacy of these devices. Understanding the working principles of side-channel attacks has, therefore, become an important research problem. An efficient preprocessing technique is proposed in this work for an attack scenario where the amount of time to collect physical leakage (PL) and access to the device is limited. The proposed preprocessing technique utilizes different side-channel distinguishers to decrease the required number of PL measurements for a given success rate by enhancing the quality of the leakage signal. Two commonly used distinguishers, Pearson correlation and mutual information, are combined in this work. For the first time, combined distinguishers are used to improve the performance of both the preprocessing and the attack steps. The success rate of the proposed attack framework outperforms the conventional single distinguisher side-channel attacks by 33% and 30% for unmasked advanced encryption standard (AES) and masked AES, respectively.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9627316","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVLSI.2021.3115420","doi":"10.1109/TVLSI.2021.3115420","startPage":"2052","endPage":"2063","pdfPath":"/iel7/92/9627316/09586560.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9586560","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 October 2021","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9586560/","displayDocTitle":"Preprocessing of the Physical Leakage Information to Combine Side-Channel Distinguishers","volume":"29","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"25 November 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9586560/","isJournal":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100006435","fundingName":"National Science Foundation (NSF) Award","grantNumber":"CNS-1929774"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000028","fundingName":"Semiconductor Research Corporation (SRC)","grantNumber":"2019-ST- 2890"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Preprocessing of the Physical Leakage Information to Combine Side-Channel Distinguishers","sourcePdf":"tvlsi-seckiner-3115420-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.09222S","chronDate":"Dec.  2021","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"9627316","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","xplore-issue":"9627316","articleId":"9586560","onlineDate":"26 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-30"},{"_id":9586737,"authors":[{"name":"Feng Tang","affiliation":["University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China","Hefei Comprehensive National Science Center, Institute of Artificial Intelligence, Hefei, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/83/9263394/9586737/tang-3120305-small.gif","p":["Feng Tang received the B.E. degree from the Dalian University of Technology, Dalian, China, in 2017.

However, previous Siamese trackers process all the training samples equally to learn the desired network, and only take the classification scores of proposals to locate the tracked target at the inference stage. To address the above issues, we propose a simple, yet effective strategy to rank the importance of training samples, and pay more attention to the important samples, which can facilitate the classification optimization. Moreover, we propose a lightweight ranking network to generate the ranking scores for proposals. Higher scores are assigned to proposals whose Intersection over Union(IoU) with the ground-truth are larger. The combination of classification and ranking scores serves as a new proposal selection criterion for online tracking, and can boost the tracking performance significantly. Our proposed method could be easily integrated into existing RPN-based Siamese networks in an end-to-end fashion. Extensive experiments are conducted on 10 tracking benchmarks, including NFS, UAV123, OTB2015, Temple-Color, VOT2016, VOT2017, VOT2019, TrackingNet, GOT-10K and LaSOT. The proposed method achieves a state-of-the-art tracking accuracy with a real-time speed.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Target tracking","Proposals","Training

However, the differences in the incidence of different diseases lead to insufficient data from medical samples, making it difficult train efficient and accurate prediction models. Therefore, the small data problem becomes an urgent problem for scientists to solve. In this paper, we propose a feature augmentation algorithm based on an improved visual geometry group (VGG19) neural network, which can augment the size and quality of the medical image dataset and avoid the overfitting problem of disease prediction models due to insufficient medical image dataset. We obtain the feature-augmented dataset for traditional machine learning model. The feature augmentation algorithm set out in the present paper improves in accuracy, f-score, and recall metrics.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 Oct. 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9586966/","isConference":true,"volume":"5","htmlLink":"/document/9586966/","publicationDate":"15 Oct. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"13 November 2021","conferenceDate":"15-17 Oct. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Tumor Image Feature Agumentation Algorithm based on Improved Convolutional Neural Network","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100012404","fundingName":"Fuyang Normal University"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002729","fundingName":"Anhui University"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Tumor Image Feature Agumentation Algorithm based on Improved Convolutional Neural Network","confLoc":"Xi'an, China","sourcePdf":"20210923.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069152S","chronDate":"15-17 Oct. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9586775","isNumber":"9586741","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9586775","xplore-issue":"9586741","articleId":"9586966","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":9587071,"authors":[{"name":"Junsong Xie","affiliation":["Anhui Medical University, Hefei, China"],"firstName":"Junsong","lastName":"Xie","id":"37089020069"},{"name":"Zezhi Wu","affiliation":["Anhui Medical University, Hefei, China"],"firstName":"Zezhi","lastName":"Wu","id":"37089019220"},{"name":"Renju Zhu","affiliation":["Hefei BOE Hospital, Hefei, China"],"firstName":"Renju","lastName":"Zhu","id":"37089019331"},{"name":"Hong Zhu","affiliation":["Anhui Branch, China Postal Savings Bank, Hefei, China"],"firstName":"Hong","lastName":"Zhu","id":"37089020375"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-1599-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4679-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2693-3128"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2693-3136"}],"articleNumber":"9587071","dbTime":"20 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Deep learning","Melanoma","Transformers","Feature extraction","Skin","Lesions","Noise measurement"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["swin transformer","melanoma detection","simam","skin cancer","focal loss"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Melanoma Detection based on Swin Transformer and SimAM","doi":"10.1109/ITNEC52019.2021.9587071","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9586741","endPage":"1521","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 5th Information Technology,Networking,Electronic and Automation Control Conference (ITNEC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 5th Information Technology,Networking,Electronic and Automation Control Conference (ITNEC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9586775/9586741/09587071.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITNEC52019.2021.9587071","startPage":"1517","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9587071","abstract":"Melanoma is one of the most deadly skin diseases. Deep learning has achieved excellent performance in natural image classification and is increasingly used in the medical field. Recognition of melanoma is challenging, due to imbalanced classes, insufficient labeled skin disease data, and noisy data obtained from heterogeneous sources. This paper has designed the Swin-SimAM network, utilizing the powerful feature extraction capabilities of Swin Transformer, and incorporating the parameter-free attention module SimAM to make it pay more attention to the helpful parts of skin lesions. Focal loss is adopted to address class imbalance such that contribution loss of nonmelanoma to the entire network becomes small even if their number is large. We conduct experiments on the ISIC-2017 skin dataset. Our results indicate that the designed Swin-SimAM network can adaptively extracts features on the discriminative parts of skin lesions, and thus improves the performance of melanoma detection.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9587071/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 Oct. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"5","publicationDate":"15 Oct. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"13 November 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9587071/","conferenceDate":"15-17 Oct. 2021","displayDocTitle":"Melanoma Detection based on Swin Transformer and SimAM","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002947","fundingName":"Anhui Medical University"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Melanoma Detection based on Swin Transformer and SimAM","confLoc":"Xi'an, China","sourcePdf":"20211024.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.0668S","chronDate":"15-17 Oct. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9586775","isNumber":"9586741","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9586775","xplore-issue":"9586741","articleId":"9587071","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-17"},{"_id":9587190,"authors":[{"name":"Dayuan Zhang","affiliation":["Nanjing Research Institute of Electronic Technology, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Dayuan","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37089020118"},{"name":"Daobo Ben","affiliation":["Nanjing Research Institute of Electronic Technology, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Daobo","lastName":"Ben","id":"37088833070"},{"name":"Chengyu Jiang","affiliation":["NAN TONG MAPLEAF POWER AUTOMATION CO.

This technology can be used in several legit commercial applications (e.g. call centres) as well as criminal activities, such as the impersonation of someone\u2019s voice.In this paper, we analyze how synthetic speech is generated and propose deep learning methodologies to detect such synthesized utterances. Using a large dataset containing both synthetic and real speech, we analyzed the performance of the latest deep learning models in the classification of such utterances. Our proposed model achieves up to 92.00% accuracy in detecting unseen synthetic speech, which is a significant improvement from human performance (65.7%).","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9587406/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 Oct. 2021","conferenceDate":"13-15 Oct. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"13 Oct. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"13 November 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9587406/","displayDocTitle":"Synthetic Speech Detection Using Neural Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Synthetic Speech Detection Using Neural Networks","confLoc":"Bucharest, Romania","sourcePdf":"33.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.601218S","chronDate":"13-15 Oct. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9586791","isNumber":"9587340","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9586791","xplore-issue":"9587340","articleId":"9587406","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":9587479,"authors":[{"name":"Fahad Radhi Alharbi","affiliation":["Lancaster University, Lancaster, UK"],"firstName":"Fahad Radhi","lastName":"Alharbi","id":"37088570476"},{"name":"Denes Csala","affiliation":["Lancaster University, Lancaster, UK"],"firstName":"Denes","lastName":"Csala","id":"37086922660"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3512-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3513-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9587479","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":27},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9587479","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Measurement","Recurrent neural networks","Wind speed","Computational modeling","Urban areas","Computer architecture"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["GRU model","recurrent neural network","short-term","update gate","reset gate","prediction","temperature","wind speed"]}],"doi":"10.1109/GPECOM52585.2021.9587479","pdfPath":"/iel7/9587335/9586802/09587479.pdf","publicationTitle":"2021 3rd Global Power, Energy and Communication Conference (GPECOM)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 3rd Global Power, Energy and Communication Conference (GPECOM)","startPage":"142","endPage":"147","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9586802","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GPECOM52585.2021.9587479","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Short-Term Wind Speed and Temperature Forecasting Model Based on Gated Recurrent Unit Neural Networks","abstract":"Wind energy generation fluctuations and intermittency issues create inefficiency and instability in power management. The recurrent neural networks (RNNs) prediction approaches are an essential technology that can improve wind power generation and assist in energy management and power systems\u2019 performance. In this paper, a prediction model based on Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) neural networks is proposed to predict wind speed and temperature values one week ahead in the future at hourly intervals. The GRU prediction model automatically learnt the features, used fewer training parameters, and required a shorter time to train compared to other types of RNNs. The GRU model was designed to predict 169 hours ahead as a short-term period of wind speed and temperature values based on 36 years of hourly historical data (1 January 1985 to 6 June 2021) collected from Dumat al-Jandal city. The findings notably indicate that the GRU model has promising performance with significant prediction accuracies in terms of overfitting, reliability, resolution, efficiency, and generalizable processes. The GRU model is characterized by its good performance and influential evaluation error metrics for wind speed and temperature values.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 Oct. 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9587479/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9587479/","publicationDate":"5 Oct. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"13 November 2021","conferenceDate":"5-8 Oct. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Short-Term Wind Speed and Temperature Forecasting Model Based on Gated Recurrent Unit Neural Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Short-Term Wind Speed and Temperature Forecasting Model Based on Gated Recurrent Unit Neural Networks","confLoc":"Antalya, Turkey","sourcePdf":"GPECOM2021-29.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054551S","chronDate":"5-8 Oct. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9587335","isNumber":"9586802","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9587335","xplore-issue":"9586802","articleId":"9587479","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":9587503,"authors":[{"name":"S.K Shrikanth Rao","affiliation":["Vivekananda College of Engineering & Technology, Puttur, Karnataka, India"],"firstName":"S.K","lastName":"Shrikanth Rao","id":"37089026652"},{"name":"Maheshkumar H Kolekar","affiliation":["IIT, Patna, India"],"firstName":"Maheshkumar H","lastName":"Kolekar","id":"37392163200"},{"name":"Roshan Joy Martis","affiliation":["Global Academy of Technology, Bangalore, Karnataka, India"],"firstName":"Roshan Joy","lastName":"Martis","id":"37391320400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-1836-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3070-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9587503","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":19},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9587503","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Support vector machines","Deep learning","Heart beat","Atrial fibrillation","Computer architecture","Transforms","Electrocardiography"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["AF","LSTM","BiLSTM","SVM","Deep Learning"]}],"abstract":"Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a disorder related to the heart.

Prior shallow networks' limitations frequently prevented successful training and abstraction of hierarchical representations of multidimensional training data, but deep learning can often overcome them. The vast majority of realworld biometric systems are still unimodal. Person recognition is performed by unimodal biometric systems, which use only one source of biometric data. Problems including noisy sensor data, nonuniversality, and spoof attacks are common in such systems. Multibiometric solves these issues.

In this paper, an efficient RF power amplifier is designed to perform better in terms of parameters such as conversion gain and power consumption, thereby increasing its efficiency. The Cadence tool is used to create the design. There is a risk of signal strength loss due to the volume of wireless communication. Power amplifiers aid in increasing the energy of a weak RF signal from a wireless communication transmitter.

[15] Because of the linked nature of stock prices, sequential prediction algorithms may be used for stock market prediction efficiently. ML methods can identify patterns and determine the logic and forecasts and can be utilized to produce unerringly correct predictions. [8] We have explored several different algorithms to forecast the stock market from simple algorithms, such as Simple Average, Linear regression, to advance algorithms like ARIMA, LSTM, and compare what gives us a more accurate result and works more efficiently. We offer a research technology that employs the improved Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) version of RNN, with stochastic gradient descent maintaining the weights for each data variable.

Bearings are the main reason for the occurrence of faults in rotating machinery systems. Accurate and quick bearings faults detection is important for machinery systems. Nowadays, Deep learning comes up as a very effective artificial intelligence technique. CNN or Convolution neural network is a class of deep neural networks that are used for the diagnosis of faults. Another technique is the support vector machine technique which is a supervised machine learning model which is effectively used for fault classification. In this study, Convolution neural network (CNN) and support vector machine (SVM) algorithm is proposed for fault detection and classification. For the classification of rolling bearing faults, Firstly, vibration signals are converted into time-domain signals and normalization has also been done for achieving better result. A new model is generated for fault classification based on Convolution neural networks and SVM algorithm. To find out the bearing fault and to classify them in real-time a training model can be used. Comparative analysis is done and experimental results show that the CNN model classify with 100% accuracy. To show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, the performance is compared with existing literature works. Better results are obtained from the algorithm of CNN than the existing work.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 Oct. 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9587774/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9587774/","publicationDate":"1 Oct. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"13 November 2021","conferenceDate":"1-3 Oct. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Motor Bearing Faults Detection and Classification based on Convolutional Neural Network and Support Vector Machine: A Comparative Study","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Motor Bearing Faults Detection and Classification based on Convolutional Neural Network and Support Vector Machine: A Comparative Study","confLoc":"Bangalore, India","sourcePdf":"GCAT2021Paper0136.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055207S","chronDate":"1-3 Oct. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9586795","isNumber":"9586796","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9586795","xplore-issue":"9586796","articleId":"9587774","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":9587778,"authors":[{"name":"Nemil Shah","affiliation":["Computer Engineering, DJ Sanghvi College of Engineering, Mumbai, India"],"firstName":"Nemil","lastName":"Shah","id":"37089021003"},{"name":"Jay Bhatia","affiliation":["Computer Engineering, DJ Sanghvi College of Engineering, Mumbai, India"],"firstName":"Jay","lastName":"Bhatia","id":"37089025068"},{"name":"Nimit Vasavat","affiliation":["Computer Engineering, DJ Sanghvi College of Engineering, Mumbai, India"],"firstName":"Nimit","lastName":"Vasavat","id":"37089024181"},{"name":"Rishi Desai","affiliation":["Computer Engineering, DJ Sanghvi College of Engineering, Mumbai, India"],"firstName":"Rishi","lastName":"Desai","id":"37089017521"},{"name":"Pankaj Sonawane","affiliation":["Computer Engineering, DJ Sanghvi College of Engineering, Mumbai, India"],"firstName":"Pankaj","lastName":"Sonawane","id":"37088524441"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-1836-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3070-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9587778","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":26},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9587778","abstract":"Sepsis can cause overwhelming changes that impair multiple organs, leading to their failure and sometimes even having fatal results. Low blood pressure, difficulty in breathing, fever, mental confusion, and fast heart rate are some of the symptoms. Infections acquired in health care settings also frequently result in Sepsis. These infections affect hundreds of millions of patients globally every year and are one of the most recurrent adverse events during care delivery. Clinical conditions can rapidly deteriorate as healthcare-associated disorders are often impervious to antibiotics. During critical scenarios such as an intensive care unit, Early diagnosis and timely medical treatment of sepsis is crucial to give the patient prompt treatment since there is an increase in the mortality rate as each hour passes away in critical care. This paper proposes a method to predict the inception of sepsis 6 hours in advance using various machine learning and deep learning models and presents a comparative study of the same. The Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC3) dataset was used to test the traditional machine learning methods such as RandomForest(RF), XGBoost, and also Deep Learning techniques such as neural networks and Autoencoders with XGBoost. The dataset contains an extensive range of parameters that are associated with laboratory, vitals, and demographics of patients which help them classify as sepsis and non-sepsis patients. A data pipeline was successfully created to clean the data, impute missing values and perform various feature engineering techniques. Our best performing model is a Deep Neural Network with an AUC ROC score of 0.888.","doi":"10.1109/GCAT52182.2021.9587778","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 2nd Global Conference for Advancement in Technology (GCAT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9586795/9586796/09587778.pdf","publicationTitle":"2021 2nd Global Conference for Advancement in Technology (GCAT)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GCAT52182.2021.9587778","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9586796","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Early Sepsis Detection using Machine Learning and Neural Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Deep learning","Heart rate","Neural networks","Pipelines","MIMICs","Medical treatment","Predictive models"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Sepsis","Deep neural networks","Autoencoders","XGBoost","Random Forest","Machine Learning"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9587778/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 Oct. 2021","displayDocTitle":"Early Sepsis Detection using Machine Learning and Neural Networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9587778/","publicationDate":"1 Oct. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"13 November 2021","conferenceDate":"1-3 Oct. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Early Sepsis Detection using Machine Learning and Neural Networks","confLoc":"Bangalore, India","sourcePdf":"GCAT2021Paper0857.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057314S","chronDate":"1-3 Oct. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9586795","isNumber":"9586796","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9586795","xplore-issue":"9586796","articleId":"9587778","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":9587839,"authors":[{"name":"Meriem M\u2019dioud","affiliation":["Laboratory Engineering Sciences ENSA, Ibn Tofail University, Kenitra, Morocco"],"firstName":"Meriem","lastName":"M\u2019dioud","id":"37089019496"},{"name":"Rachid Bannari","affiliation":["Laboratory Engineering Sciences ENSA, Ibn Tofail University, Kenitra, Morocco"],"firstName":"Rachid","lastName":"Bannari","id":"37086175083"},{"name":"Ismail Elkafazi","affiliation":["Laboratory SMARTILAB EMSI, Rabat, Morocco"],"firstName":"Ismail","lastName":"Elkafazi","id":"37089019497"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3512-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3513-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9587839","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":11},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9587839","abstract":"Distributed Generation is a good solution to eliminate the problem of the power loss of the distribution network, which takes a high value at the peak demand.

However, in the vision of minimizing the value of the active power loss, the quality of these approaches is still low. otherwise, we define some disadvantages of these optimization techniques like the complexity, the precision of the outputs, and the convergence before time. For this reason, this study presents an enhanced PSO algorithm by using the logistic map to search the optimal sites and sizes of the DG units taking into consideration two kinds of DG (inject only active power, and inject both active and reactive power) with the objective function is to minimize the active power loss, to enhance the voltage profile, and to tackle the drawbacks of the recent paper.

When it comes to solving a mathematical expression, we are highly dependent on the calculators that are available in almost every electronic gadget. Since all these gadgets are touchscreen-based nowadays, building a system that recognizes and solves online handwritten mathematical expressions is the potential area of this research. Recognition of online handwritten mathematical expressions is a complicated task. In this paper, an Artificial Neural Network model is built for the recognition of handwritten digits, operators, and symbols. Tkinter GUI interface is built for the users to type in their expressions and image processing is done by capturing an image from the canvas and converting it into a NumPy array and then applying the thresholding technique to convert it into a binary array. Connected component labeling is done to separate every number and symbol on the canvas. These numbers and symbols are then sent to the artificial neural network for predictions. The model gave a training accuracy of 98.97% and a test accuracy of 98.95%. Finally, the expression is evaluated, and the translated expression and output are shown on the Tkinter GUI interface.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 Oct. 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9587866/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9587866/","publicationDate":"1 Oct. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"13 November 2021","conferenceDate":"1-3 Oct. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Online Handwritten Mathematical Expression Solver Using Artificial Neural Network","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Online Handwritten Mathematical Expression Solver Using Artificial Neural Network","confLoc":"Bangalore, India","sourcePdf":"GCAT2021Paper1028.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039593S","chronDate":"1-3 Oct. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9586795","isNumber":"9586796","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9586795","xplore-issue":"9586796","articleId":"9587866","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":9587895,"authors":[{"name":"Md.

The rise or decline in the share price has a significant impact on the investor\u2019s profit. Accurate prediction of the dynamic and volatile stock price movements can enhance the confidence of investors in the share market and hence can increase the volume of investment. Due to the chaotic, non-linear, and complex nature of the share price pattern, traditional time-series analysis exhibits poor performance. In this paper, we propose a new deep learning-based forecasting framework, Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (BiGRU) incorporated with an external activation layer that utilizes both the forward and backward propagation feature of the Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). We compare our proposed model with the prevalent bidirectional RNN model, known as Bidirectional Long Short Term Memory (BiLSTM). We implemented both models on three different datasets collected from the NIFTY-50 index. We considered five different evaluation metrics to evaluate the model performance. For the different combinations of hidden layers and data, our model shows better performance in comparison to BiLSTM. The BiGRU model also shows better stability in comparison to BiLSTM, with smaller trainable parameters. It can also accurately forecast stock price for a greater prediction window, in comparison to BiLSTM. Our model can also predict all the sudden spikes on 1000 days ahead prediction precisely.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9587895/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 Oct. 2021","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"1-3 Oct. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9587895/","dateOfInsertion":"13 November 2021","publicationDate":"1 Oct. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A Deep Learning-Based Approach for Stock Price Prediction Using Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit and Bidirectional Long Short Term Memory Model","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Deep Learning-Based Approach for Stock Price Prediction Using Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit and Bidirectional Long Short Term Memory Model","confLoc":"Bangalore, India","sourcePdf":"GCAT2021Paper0708.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052735S","chronDate":"1-3 Oct. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9586795","isNumber":"9586796","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9586795","xplore-issue":"9586796","articleId":"9587895","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-26"},{"_id":9588142,"authors":[{"name":"Qizhao Wang","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Networked Control Systems, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shenyang, China","Shenyang Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shenyang, China","Institutes for Robotics and Intelligent Manufacturing, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shenyang, China","University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Qizhao","lastName":"Wang","id":"37088586871"},{"name":"Guangshu Jin","affiliation":["Microcyber Corporation, Shenyang, China"],"firstName":"Guangshu","lastName":"Jin","id":"37088587390"},{"name":"Qing Li","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Networked Control Systems, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shenyang, China","Shenyang Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shenyang, China","Institutes for Robotics and Intelligent Manufacturing, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shenyang, China","University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Qing","lastName":"Li","id":"37403675200"},{"name":"Kai Wang","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Networked Control Systems, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shenyang, China","Shenyang Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shenyang, China","Institutes for Robotics and Intelligent Manufacturing, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shenyang, China"],"firstName":"Kai","lastName":"Wang","id":"37066902500"},{"name":"Zuye Yang","affiliation":["Microcyber Corporation, Shenyang, China"],"firstName":"Zuye","lastName":"Yang","id":"37088587454"},{"name":"Hong Wang","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Networked Control Systems, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shenyang, China","Shenyang Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shenyang, China","Institutes for Robotics and Intelligent Manufacturing, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shenyang, China"],"firstName":"Hong","lastName":"Wang","id":"37086784798"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-2527-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3529-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2642-6633"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2379-7711"}],"articleNumber":"9588142","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":12},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fault diagnosis","Deep learning","Performance evaluation","Neural networks","Collaboration","Real-time systems","Servers"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9588142","abstract":"Data-driven fault diagnosis algorithms represented by deep learning have been widely used in industrial equipment fault diagnosis.

The proposed network includes residual blocks, a multiscale feature extraction module for extracting multiscale lesions, and an attention module that captures cross-dimension interaction and extracts lesion features better from complex backgrounds. Extensive experimental results show that the proposed network achieves the average identification accuracy of 88.64% on the dataset with the complex backdrop. It also proves that the method has significant advantages in terms of network complexity and realtime performance compared with other models. Moreover, on the other public dataset, the proposed method achieves brilliant results. It is certified that the attention module recognizes disease spots more accurately and has few parameters relative to another state-of-the-art method. The results demonstrate that the proposed model provides a high-performance solution for crop diagnosis under the real agricultural environment.","doi":"10.1109/CYBER53097.2021.9588258","startPage":"855","endPage":"860","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 11th Annual International Conference on CYBER Technology in Automation, Control, and Intelligent Systems (CYBER)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9586782/9588101/09588258.pdf","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 11th Annual International Conference on CYBER Technology in Automation, Control, and Intelligent Systems (CYBER)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CYBER53097.2021.9588258","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9588101","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Diagnosis Method of Tomato Leaf Disease Based on an Improved Deep Convolution Neural Network for Real-life Agriculture Environment","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Convolution","Neural networks","Crops","Feature extraction","Agriculture","Medical diagnosis","Lesions"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9588258/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-31 July 2021","displayDocTitle":"Diagnosis Method of Tomato Leaf Disease Based on an Improved Deep Convolution Neural Network for Real-life Agriculture Environment","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9588258/","publicationDate":"27 July 2021","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2021","conferenceDate":"27-31 July 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100010014","fundingName":"Six talent peaks project in Jiangsu Province","grantNumber":"GDZB-039"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Diagnosis Method of Tomato Leaf Disease Based on an Improved Deep Convolution Neural Network for Real-life Agriculture Environment","confLoc":"Jiaxing, China","sourcePdf":"cyber21-155.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051223S","chronDate":"27-31 July 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9586782","isNumber":"9588101","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9586782","xplore-issue":"9588101","articleId":"9588258","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":9588309,"authors":[{"name":"Zi-Qin Ling","affiliation":["Guangdong Key Laboratory of Electromagnetic Control and Intelligent Robots, Shenzhen Key Laboratory of Electromagnetic Control, College of Mechatronics and Control Engineering, Shenzhen University, Shenzhen, China"],"firstName":"Zi-Qin","lastName":"Ling","id":"37088924008"},{"name":"Guang-Zhong Cao","affiliation":["Guangdong Key Laboratory of Electromagnetic Control and Intelligent Robots, Shenzhen Key Laboratory of Electromagnetic Control, College of Mechatronics and Control Engineering, Shenzhen University, Shenzhen, China"],"firstName":"Guang-Zhong","lastName":"Cao","id":"37273327200"},{"name":"Yue-Peng Zhang","affiliation":["Guangdong Key Laboratory of Electromagnetic Control and Intelligent Robots, Shenzhen Key Laboratory of Electromagnetic Control, College of Mechatronics and Control Engineering, Shenzhen University, Shenzhen, China"],"firstName":"Yue-Peng","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37088924711"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-2527-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3529-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2642-6633"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2379-7711"}],"articleNumber":"9588309","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":9},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fault diagnosis","Training","Employee welfare","Convolution","Neural networks","Transfer learning","Rolling bearings"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Rolling Bearing","Fault Diagnosis","Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)","Transfer Learning"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9588309","abstract":"Aiming at the problems of low accuracy of the existing fault diagnosis methods for rolling bearings, an improved convolution neural network model for rolling bearing fault diagnosis is proposed.

These handcrafted features play a significant role to enhance performance. In this paper, the key contribution is that the datasets are reduced to eliminate the complexity of the model by implementing RNN-based approaches. 11,376 skeleton features are reduced to 5 geometrical features selected from 40 different subjects and 12 different action classes of daily and health-related actions. Further, we also introduce an LSTM model to classify medical suspicious activities. The set of relevant geometrical attributes are carefully chosen to train the LSTM model. Experimental work is performed on the multilayer LSTM framework to have a good impact on performance as human activity has a greater diversity. The relations between geometrical different datasets such as selected lines and distances between relevant coordinates of joints are evaluated using NTUD 60 dataset. Also, it is demonstrated that less training data is required for classification between normal and medical activity. The Joint-Joint Distance features show 89.07% accuracy on cross-view evaluation and 78.31% accuracy on cross-subject evaluation.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 Sept. 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9588719/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9588719/","publicationDate":"20 Sept. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"13 November 2021","conferenceDate":"20-22 Sept. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Suspicious Human Activity Detection Using Pose Estimation and LSTM","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Suspicious Human Activity Detection Using Pose Estimation and LSTM","confLoc":"Goa, India","sourcePdf":"0070.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072901S","chronDate":"20-22 Sept. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9586784","isNumber":"9588667","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9586784","xplore-issue":"9588667","articleId":"9588719","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":9588732,"authors":[{"name":"Subrat Kumar Pradhan","affiliation":["National Institute of Technology Nagaland, Dimapur, India"],"firstName":"Subrat Kumar","lastName":"Pradhan","id":"37087086060"},{"name":"Dushmanta Kumar Das","affiliation":["National Institute of Technology Nagaland, Dimapur, India"],"firstName":"Dushmanta Kumar","lastName":"Das","id":"37955663200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3323-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3324-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9588732","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":10},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9588732","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Damping","State feedback","Service robots","Design methodology","Power system stability","Delays","Linear matrix inequalities"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["closed loop systems","control system synthesis","damping","delays","feedback","linear matrix inequalities","Lyapunov methods","oscillations","power system control","power system stability","stability","state feedback","thyristor applications","time-varying systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["thyristor-controlled-series-capacitor","state feedback control mechanism","closed-loop power system","feedback controller parameters","wide-area damping controller","inter-area oscillation damping considering time-varying communication delay","wide-area power system","two-area power system","two-area test system","supplementary damping controller"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Wide-area damping control","State feedback controller","Time-varying delay","Linear matrix inequality"]}],"abstract":"This paper proposes a wide-area damping controller for reducing inter-area oscillation in power systems.

A state feedback control mechanism is adopted to design the damping controller. The effect of delay due to communication between power system and controller is also taken into account. A delay-dependent stabilization criterion based on linear matrix inequality is developed using Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional for the closed-loop power system. The feedback controller parameters are obtained from the solution of stabilization criterion.

Image classification research for this hatching machine object is divided into three categories: chicks, eggs, and hatched eggs. This study has issues with overfitting the model. To address the issues, several methods were used, including image augmentation, image reshaping, and Dropout regularization on the convolution layer.

This is especially problematic in scenarios involving images of subjects whose recognition is reliant on the presence of specific characteristics, for example, faces. In this paper, we describe a deep learning model that is capable of generating an 8x upscaled photo from a low resolution image of a face. The underlying model is based on the SRGAN architecture that deviates from the conventional GAN approach of the adversarial back and forth between generator and discriminator by incorporating an added content loss whose value is dependent on the detection of the natural features in the generated image by a pre-trained VGG model. The model is trained on the Celeb Faces Attributes dataset with over 1,00,000 data points and can produce upscaled images that are realistic with a coherent presence of the natural attributes of a face.","doi":"10.1109/STCR51658.2021.9588816","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 Smart Technologies, Communication and Robotics (STCR)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9586786/9587923/09588816.pdf","publicationTitle":"2021 Smart Technologies, Communication and Robotics (STCR)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/STCR51658.2021.9588816","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9587923","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Face Image Super Resolution using a Generative Adversarial Network","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Deep learning","Image resolution","Image recognition","Face recognition","Generative adversarial networks","Feature extraction","Mathematical models"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Image Super Resolution","SRGAN","Facial Enhancement"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9588816/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-10 Oct. 2021","displayDocTitle":"Face Image Super Resolution using a Generative Adversarial Network","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9588816/","publicationDate":"9 Oct. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"13 November 2021","conferenceDate":"9-10 Oct. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Face Image Super Resolution using a Generative Adversarial Network","confLoc":"Sathyamangalam, India","sourcePdf":"IEEE-STCR-2021_paper_064.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073798S","chronDate":"9-10 Oct. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9586786","isNumber":"9587923","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9586786","xplore-issue":"9587923","articleId":"9588816","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":9588936,"authors":[{"name":"Mahisha Patel","affiliation":["Deep Learning Research Braynix AI, Ahmedabad, India"],"firstName":"Mahisha","lastName":"Patel","id":"37089022027"},{"name":"Amitabh Das","affiliation":["Deep Learning Research Braynix AI, Ahmedabad, India"],"firstName":"Amitabh","lastName":"Das","id":"37089020957"},{"name":"Vineet Kumar Pant","affiliation":["Deep Learning Research Braynix AI, Ahmedabad, India"],"firstName":"Vineet Kumar","lastName":"Pant","id":"37089024845"},{"name":"Jayasurya M","affiliation":["Deep Learning Research Braynix AI, Ahmedabad, India"],"firstName":"Jayasurya","lastName":"M","id":"37088864799"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-1806-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-1807-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9588936","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":28},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9588936","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Deep learning","Image segmentation","Solid modeling","Thresholding (Imaging)","Transfer learning","Standardization","Data models"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Ensemble methods","Tuberculosis","CNN","Deep Learning","Medical images"]}],"abstract":"Diagnosis of Tuberculosis has witnessed a substantial improvement owing to the infusion of technology in the form of deep learning classification.

A varied food menu with different nutritional content will be difficult to regulate the exact calorie needs. Therefore we need a method that can help solve this problem. One method that can be used is the PRoFIGA model genetic algorithm. In this paper, the PRoFIGA genetic algorithm is implemented into a system. The result of this paper is scheduling a balanced nutritional diet with food recommendations according to the calories needed using the PRoFIGA genetic algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/CITSM52892.2021.9588940","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 9th International Conference on Cyber and IT Service Management (CITSM)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9586793/9587915/09588940.pdf","publicationTitle":"2021 9th International Conference on Cyber and IT Service Management (CITSM)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CITSM52892.2021.9588940","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9587915","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Population Resizing Model on Fitness Improvement Genetic Algorithm (PRoFIGA) Optimation on Food Scheduling","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Schedules","Sociology","Scheduling","Regulation","Statistics","Genetic algorithms"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Scheduling","Genetic Algorithm","PRoFIGA"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9588940/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-23 Sept. 2021","displayDocTitle":"Population Resizing Model on Fitness Improvement Genetic Algorithm (PRoFIGA) Optimation on Food Scheduling","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9588940/","publicationDate":"22 Sept. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"13 November 2021","conferenceDate":"22-23 Sept. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Population Resizing Model on Fitness Improvement Genetic Algorithm (PRoFIGA) Optimation on Food Scheduling","confLoc":"Bengkulu, Indonesia","sourcePdf":"CITSM2021_122.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061216S","chronDate":"22-23 Sept. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9586793","isNumber":"9587915","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9586793","xplore-issue":"9587915","articleId":"9588940","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":9588947,"authors":[{"name":"Nurhayati Buslim","affiliation":["Informatics Engineering, Universitas Negeri Syarif Hidayatullah Jakarta, Jakarta, Indonesia"],"firstName":"Nurhayati","lastName":"Buslim","id":"37089028235"},{"name":"Imam Lutfi Rahmatullah","affiliation":["Informatics Engineering, Universitas Negeri Syarif Hidayatullah Jakarta, Jakarta, Indonesia"],"firstName":"Imam Lutfi","lastName":"Rahmatullah","id":"37089029532"},{"name":"Bayu Aji Setyawan","affiliation":["Informatics Engineering, Universitas Negeri Syarif Hidayatullah Jakarta, Jakarta, Indonesia"],"firstName":"Bayu Aji","lastName":"Setyawan","id":"37089027045"},{"name":"Aryajaya Alamsyah","affiliation":["Informatics Engineering, Universitas Negeri Syarif Hidayatullah Jakarta, Jakarta, Indonesia"],"firstName":"Aryajaya","lastName":"Alamsyah","id":"37089027524"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3548-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3549-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9588947","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":10},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Deep learning","Fluctuations","Computational modeling","Search methods","Stochastic processes","Bitcoin"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["GRU","RNN","LSTM","Random Search","Grid Search"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9588947","abstract":"Being the most expensive and most popular cryptocurrency, both the business world and the research community have started to study bitcoin development.

This work studies a two-user, single-channel cognitive radio network, where the primary user\u2019s transmit/idle dynamics are modeled as a binary Markov chain, and the secondary user decides to either sense or transmit. Under this setup, the age of the information sensed by the secondary user has a direct impact on its performance. The secondary user aims to maximize its throughput subject to a constraint on the probability of collision experienced by the primary. Using the Markov chain model of the primary user, the secondary user decides on its transmission and sensing strategy based on the estimated evolution of the primary user transmission state. For a stationary randomized transmission policy that depends on the sensed state, we derive the secondary throughput and the collision probability. Due to the complexity of the resulting expressions, we develop an alternative formulation of the problem by recognizing that the throughput and collision probability are functions of the age of each type of sensed information. Therefore, we transform the problem by converting the randomized policy to its induced age distribution function. As a result, the age distribution-based formulation results in a linear program, which can be solved efficiently. We include numerical results and simulations, and discuss the role of the age distribution and other related qualities of the information.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 Oct. 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9589083/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"18 Oct. 2021","conferenceDate":"18-21 Oct. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9589083/","dateOfInsertion":"13 November 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Age of Sensed Information in a Cognitive Radio Network","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Age of Sensed Information in a Cognitive Radio Network","confLoc":"Philadelphia, PA, USA","sourcePdf":"WiOpt_2021_paper_31.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.095926S","chronDate":"18-21 Oct. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9588334","isNumber":"9589050","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9588334","xplore-issue":"9589050","articleId":"9589083","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IFIP","lastupdate":"2021-11-11"},{"_id":9589106,"authors":[{"name":"Peng Li","affiliation":["School of Cyber Science and Engineering, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Peng","lastName":"Li"},{"name":"Di Liu","affiliation":["School of Cyber Science and Engineering, Southeast University, Nanjing, China","Bernoulli Institute for Mathematics, Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence, University of Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands"],"firstName":"Di","lastName":"Liu"},{"name":"Simone Baldi","affiliation":["School of Cyber Science and Engineering, Southeast University, Nanjing, China","Delft Center for Systems and Control, TU Delft, The Netherlands"],"firstName":"Simone","lastName":"Baldi"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3554-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-0256-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2577-1647"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"1553-572X"}],"articleNumber":"9589106","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Industrial electronics","Uncertainty","Codes","Conferences","Unmanned aerial vehicles","Autopilot","PD control"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Plug-and-play adaptation in autopilot architectures for unmanned aerial vehicles","doi":"10.1109/IECON48115.2021.9589106","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9589036","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"IECON 2021 \u2013 47th Annual Conference of the IEEE Industrial Electronics Society","displayPublicationTitle":"IECON 2021 \u2013 47th Annual Conference of the IEEE Industrial Electronics Society","pdfPath":"/iel7/9588332/9589036/09589106.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IECON48115.2021.9589106","startPage":"1","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9589106","abstract":"An accepted autopilot control architecture for fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is the so-called cascaded loop closure, in which inner velocity loops and outer position loops are successively closed with proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controllers. This architecture has become so standard that popular open-source autopilots (e.g. ArduPilot, PX4) implement it in their codes. Despite its popularity, such architecture cannot adequately cope with the inevitable uncertainty in the UAV dynamics. In this work we present a \"plug-and-play\" adaptive module integrated in standard cascaded autopilot architectures, so as to can guarantee adaptation in the presence of uncertainty. The proposed module is analyzed and tested in a software-in-the-loop environment for an ArduPilot-based autopilot. The tests show that, in the presence of uncertainties occurring during flight, the proposed adaptation module outperforms the original autopilot as well as non-adaptive autopilots.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9589106/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Oct. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"13 Oct. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"13 November 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9589106/","conferenceDate":"13-16 Oct. 2021","displayDocTitle":"Plug-and-play adaptation in autopilot architectures for unmanned aerial vehicles","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Plug-and-play adaptation in autopilot architectures for unmanned aerial vehicles","confLoc":"Toronto, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"TF-016535.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077069S","chronDate":"13-16 Oct. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9588332","isNumber":"9589036","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9588332","xplore-issue":"9589036","articleId":"9589106","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-17"},{"_id":9589185,"authors":[{"name":"Clemens Heistracher","affiliation":["Digital Safety and Security, Austrian Institute of Technology"],"firstName":"Clemens","lastName":"Heistracher","id":"37086960861"},{"name":"Anahid Jalali","affiliation":["Digital Safety and Security, Austrian Institute of Technology"],"firstName":"Anahid","lastName":"Jalali","id":"37086959056"},{"name":"Indu Strobl","affiliation":["Distributed AI Systems, Siemens, AG, Austria"],"firstName":"Indu","lastName":"Strobl","id":"37089026345"},{"name":"Axel Suendermann","affiliation":["Distributed AI Systems, Siemens, AG, Austria"],"firstName":"Axel","lastName":"Suendermann","id":"37089024745"},{"name":"Sebastian Meixner","affiliation":["Distributed AI Systems, Siemens, AG, Austria"],"firstName":"Sebastian","lastName":"Meixner","id":"37087051236"},{"name":"Stephanie Holly","affiliation":["Distributed AI Systems, Siemens, AG, Austria"],"firstName":"Stephanie","lastName":"Holly","id":"37089024179"},{"name":"Daniel Schall","affiliation":["Distributed AI Systems, Siemens, AG, Austria"],"firstName":"Daniel","lastName":"Schall","id":"37390959500"},{"name":"Bernhard Haslhofer","affiliation":["Digital Safety and Security, Austrian Institute of Technology"],"firstName":"Bernhard","lastName":"Haslhofer","id":"37549992700"},{"name":"Jana Kemnitz","affiliation":["Distributed AI Systems, Siemens, AG, Austria"],"firstName":"Jana","lastName":"Kemnitz","id":"37089026368"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3554-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-0256-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2577-1647"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"1553-572X"}],"articleNumber":"9589185","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":5},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Vibrations","Training","Industries","Transfer learning","Time series analysis","Training data","Maintenance engineering"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["datasets","anomaly classification","vibration signal","framework"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9589185","abstract":"An increasing number of industrial assets are equipped with IoT sensor platforms and the industry now expects data-driven maintenance strategies with minimal deployment costs.

For optimal energy management the forecast of energy consumption is of great interest.This paper takes a novel approach for forecasting the energy demand in households by using a hybrid AI approach. On the one hand, we use an interpretable model creation by using fuzzy rules. Those rules are then combined with an evolutionary strategy to create new simulation data which calibrates the reality and sometimes uncertainty behind the data. Based on this newly created data, a simple artificial neural network (ANN) model is created. It is shown, that there is no need to create an unnecessarily complex deep learning architecture for achieving good results. Simple ANN models can achieve excellent results, when using data created by inferred fuzzy rules. Of great advantage is, that one part of this hybrid AI approach can still be interpreted by humans and furthermore improved by adding the knowledge of human domain experts in form of fuzzy rules.","doi":"10.1109/IECON48115.2021.9589186","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","displayPublicationTitle":"IECON 2021 \u2013 47th Annual Conference of the IEEE Industrial Electronics Society","pdfPath":"/iel7/9588332/9589036/09589186.pdf","publicationTitle":"IECON 2021 \u2013 47th Annual Conference of the IEEE Industrial Electronics Society","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IECON48115.2021.9589186","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9589036","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hybrid AI improves Energy Forecasts by combining Fuzzy Rules, Evolutionary Strategies and Neural Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Industrial electronics","Deep learning","Energy consumption","Uncertainty","Conferences","Artificial neural networks","Data models"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Hybrid AI","Neuro-fuzzy","Fuzzy Logic","Artificial Neural Network","Energy Forecast"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9589186/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Oct. 2021","displayDocTitle":"Hybrid AI improves Energy Forecasts by combining Fuzzy Rules, Evolutionary Strategies and Neural Networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9589186/","publicationDate":"13 Oct. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"13 November 2021","conferenceDate":"13-16 Oct. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hybrid AI improves Energy Forecasts by combining Fuzzy Rules, Evolutionary Strategies and Neural Networks","confLoc":"Toronto, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"TF-016918.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.10725S","chronDate":"13-16 Oct. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9588332","isNumber":"9589036","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9588332","xplore-issue":"9589036","articleId":"9589186","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":9589212,"authors":[{"name":"Duy-Linh Nguyen","affiliation":["University of Ulsan, Ulsan, Korea"],"firstName":"Duy-Linh","lastName":"Nguyen","id":"37088445135"},{"name":"Muhamad Dwisnanto Putro","affiliation":["University of Ulsan, Ulsan, Korea"],"firstName":"Muhamad","lastName":"Dwisnanto Putro","id":"37088566420"},{"name":"Xuan-Thuy Vo","affiliation":["University of Ulsan, Ulsan, Korea"],"firstName":"Xuan-Thuy","lastName":"Vo","id":"37088443442"},{"name":"Kang-Hyun Jo","affiliation":["University of Ulsan, Ulsan, Korea"],"firstName":"Kang-Hyun","lastName":"Jo","id":"37294739900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3554-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-0256-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2577-1647"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"1553-572X"}],"articleNumber":"9589212","dbTime":"1 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":6},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Industrial electronics","Convolution","Conferences","Neural networks","Alarm systems","Mobile handsets","Convolutional neural networks"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Assistant application","Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)","Global Average Pooling","Depthwise Separable Convolution","Distracted Driver Classification","Driver warning system"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9589212","abstract":"Driving is an activity that requires the coordination of many senses with complex manipulations.

This paper addresses a neural network modeling approach for nonlinear passive filters. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks are applied to model nonlinear passive filters. One measured and two simulated filter circuits are used as application examples. LSTMs are chosen by literature research as a suitable modeling approach. The neural network and training structure is defined by literature research and systematic experiments. The filter behaviors are basically modeled by the trained neural networks. But further improvements have to be done. It is shown that the corresponding voltage and current time series can be learned and predicted by the LSTM networks in their essential characteristics. These voltage and current time series can generally be used in further applications.

However, interconnecting a large number of wireless devices without jeopardizing the system performance proves challenging. To address the requirements of future industries, we investigate the cross-layer design of beamforming and scheduling for layered-division multiplexing (LDM) systems in millimeter-wave bands. Scheduling is crucial as the devices in industrial settings are expected to proliferate rapidly. Also, highly performant beamforming is necessary to ensure scalability. By adopting LDM, multiple transmissions can be non-orthogonally superimposed. Specifically, we consider a superior-importance control multicast message required to be ubiquitous to all devices and inferior-importance private unicast messages targeting a subset of scheduled devices. Due to NP-hardness, we propose BEAMWAVE, which decomposes the problem into beamforming and scheduling. Through simulations, we show that BEAMWAVE attains nearoptimality and outperforms other competing schemes.","doi":"10.23919/WiOpt52861.2021.9589282","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 19th International Symposium on Modeling and Optimization in Mobile, Ad hoc, and Wireless Networks (WiOpt)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9588334/9589050/09589282.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9589050","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/WiOpt52861.2021.9589282","publicationTitle":"2021 19th International Symposium on Modeling and Optimization in Mobile, Ad hoc, and Wireless Networks (WiOpt)","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"BEAMWAVE: Cross-layer Beamforming and Scheduling for Superimposed Transmissions in Industrial IoT mmWave Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9589282","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 Oct. 2021","displayDocTitle":"BEAMWAVE: Cross-layer Beamforming and Scheduling for Superimposed Transmissions in Industrial IoT mmWave Networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9589282/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9589282/","publicationDate":"18 Oct. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"13 November 2021","conferenceDate":"18-21 Oct. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"BEAMWAVE: Cross-layer Beamforming and Scheduling for Superimposed Transmissions in Industrial IoT mmWave Networks","confLoc":"Philadelphia, PA, USA","sourcePdf":"WiOpt_2021_paper_62.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.120877S","chronDate":"18-21 Oct. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9588334","isNumber":"9589050","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9588334","xplore-issue":"9589050","articleId":"9589282","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IFIP","lastupdate":"2021-11-11"},{"_id":9589318,"authors":[{"name":"Yixian Yang","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Smart Grid of Ministry of Education, Tianjin University, Tianjin, China"],"firstName":"Yixian","lastName":"Yang","id":"37087029891"},{"name":"Li Guo","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Smart Grid of Ministry of Education, Tianjin University, Tianjin, China"],"firstName":"Li","lastName":"Guo","id":"37629186300"},{"name":"Xialin Li","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Smart Grid of Ministry of Education, Tianjin University, Tianjin, China"],"firstName":"Xialin","lastName":"Li","id":"37078297000"},{"name":"Jiaxin Li","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Smart Grid of Ministry of Education College of Systems, Tianjin University, Tianjin, China"],"firstName":"Jiaxin","lastName":"Li","id":"37089025356"},{"name":"Wei Liu","affiliation":["Hunan Key Laboratory of Multi-Energy System Intelligent Interconnection Technology College of Systems Engineering, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Liu","id":"37089024887"},{"name":"Huihui He","affiliation":["Hunan Key Laboratory of Multi-Energy System Intelligent Interconnection Technology College of Systems Engineering, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Huihui","lastName":"He","id":"37089026651"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3554-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-0256-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2577-1647"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"1553-572X"}],"articleNumber":"9589318","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":35},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9589318","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["PI control","Simulation","Linear regression","Packet loss","Microgrids","Topology","Transient analysis"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["DC microgrids","distributed control","cyber physical system","false data injection attack","data-driven"]}],"abstract":"Distributed cooperative control strategies of DC microgrids (DCMG) reduce the detriment of communication delays, packet loss and link failure compared with centralized control.

With the increased focus on grid connected PV systems, the reliability and stability of solar inverters is a major area of interest. The existence of fault in inverter may severely affect the operation of the whole system leading to adverse effects at the grid end. To improve the system reliability, it is imperative to have a Fault Diagnostic Mechanism that is capable of identifying and classifying such failure conditions. The adoption of data driven techniques for fault classification has proved to be highly efficient. This paper proposes an intelligent data driven modified AlexNet based fault detection and classification technique for grid connected single phase PV Inverters. It incorporates global average pooling layer (GAP) as replacement of fully connected layer to realize improved network model. The fault diagnostic and classification scheme is implemented in MATLAB. The training accuracy obtained is 99.6% and testing accuracy is 99.2%.

Therefore, they are time-consuming, costly and prone to errors. In addition, the injection of perturbations has the potential of degrading the power quality of the system. In this paper, a new artificial neural network (ANN) aided cable resistance estimation approach is proposed. The ANN model is trained by simulation data. The trained ANN model can quickly and effectively map the current sharing ratios between the converters to the droop coefficients of the converters. In this way, the optimal droop coefficient combination that will yield the desired accurate current sharing ratio between the converters can be predicted by the trained ANN model. Subsequently, the optimal droop coefficient combination can be used in the estimation of the corresponding subsystem cable resistance by solving an equation set. The estimated cable resistance is compared with the simulated cable resistance and an excellent match is observed.","doi":"10.1109/IECON48115.2021.9589411","pdfPath":"/iel7/9588332/9589036/09589411.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","displayPublicationTitle":"IECON 2021 \u2013 47th Annual Conference of the IEEE Industrial Electronics Society","publicationTitle":"IECON 2021 \u2013 47th Annual Conference of the IEEE Industrial Electronics Society","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IECON48115.2021.9589411","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9589036","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Artificial Neural Network Aided Cable Resistance Estimation in Droop-Controlled Islanded DC Microgrids","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9589411/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Oct. 2021","displayDocTitle":"Artificial Neural Network Aided Cable Resistance Estimation in Droop-Controlled Islanded DC Microgrids","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2021","publicationDate":"13 Oct. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9589411/","conferenceDate":"13-16 Oct. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Artificial Neural Network Aided Cable Resistance Estimation in Droop-Controlled Islanded DC Microgrids","confLoc":"Toronto, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"TF-029033.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.132658S","chronDate":"13-16 Oct. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9588332","isNumber":"9589036","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9588332","xplore-issue":"9589036","articleId":"9589411","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":9589433,"authors":[{"name":"Yun Yu","affiliation":["AAU Energy, Aalborg University, Aalborg, Denmark"],"firstName":"Yun","lastName":"Yu","id":"37087005405"},{"name":"Gibran David Agundis Tinajero","affiliation":["AAU Energy, Aalborg University, Aalborg, Denmark"],"firstName":"Gibran David","lastName":"Agundis Tinajero","id":"37085577224"},{"name":"Sanjay K Chaudhary","affiliation":["AAU Energy, Aalborg University, Aalborg, Denmark"],"firstName":"Sanjay K","lastName":"Chaudhary","id":"37893200900"},{"name":"Luona Xu","affiliation":["AAU Energy, Aalborg University, Aalborg, Denmark"],"firstName":"Luona","lastName":"Xu","id":"37089021429"},{"name":"Nur Najihah Binti Abu Bakar","affiliation":["AAU Energy, Aalborg University, Aalborg, Denmark"],"firstName":"Nur Najihah","lastName":"Binti Abu Bakar","id":"37089026332"},{"name":"Josep M.

However, in the case that a large inertia is used in VSGs, active power oscillations can be introduced in the transients, due to the lack of enough damping effects. To avoid this phenomena, various solutions with additional damping terms have been proposed. This paper analyzes and compares six relevant fixed- parameter active-power-oscillation damping solutions in detail, where responses under set point and phase angle changes, the parameter sensitivity, and capabilities of limiting the rate of change of frequency (RoCoF) and attenuating power ripples are included. The results show the advantages and drawbacks of each solution, leading to the conclusion that extra damping terms may significantly degrade the inertial response of VSGs and have high dependency on the parameter estimation accuracy.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9589036","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IECON48115.2021.9589433","publicationTitle":"IECON 2021 \u2013 47th Annual Conference of the IEEE Industrial Electronics Society","displayPublicationTitle":"IECON 2021 \u2013 47th Annual Conference of the IEEE Industrial Electronics Society","pdfPath":"/iel7/9588332/9589036/09589433.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doi":"10.1109/IECON48115.2021.9589433","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Comparison of Fixed-Parameter Active-Power-Oscillation Damping Solutions for Virtual Synchronous Generators","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Oct. 2021","displayDocTitle":"A Comparison of Fixed-Parameter Active-Power-Oscillation Damping Solutions for Virtual Synchronous Generators","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"13-16 Oct. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9589433/","publicationDate":"13 Oct. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"13 November 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9589433/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003556","fundingName":"Ministry of Foreign Affairs"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001731","fundingName":"Danida Fellowship Centre"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Comparison of Fixed-Parameter Active-Power-Oscillation Damping Solutions for Virtual Synchronous Generators","confLoc":"Toronto, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"TF-002771.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07373S","chronDate":"13-16 Oct. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9588332","isNumber":"9589036","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9588332","xplore-issue":"9589036","articleId":"9589433","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-26"},{"_id":9589439,"authors":[{"name":"Dario Pasqualotto","affiliation":["University of Padua, Vicenza, Italy"],"firstName":"Dario","lastName":"Pasqualotto","id":"37087091185"},{"name":"Angela Navarro Navarro","affiliation":["Universitat Polit\u00e8cnica de Val\u00e8ncia, Valencia, Spain"],"firstName":"Angela Navarro","lastName":"Navarro","id":"37089021144"},{"name":"Mauro Zigliotto","affiliation":["University of Padua, Vicenza, Italy"],"firstName":"Mauro","lastName":"Zigliotto","id":"37275437400"},{"name":"Jose A.

In this work, we apply U-Net, Deeplab, and Mask R-CNN models based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for detecting and predicting the postharvest decay areas in stored apple fruits. Novelty of our approach is separate segmentation and prediction of postharvest decay and non-decay areas in apples.

The dataset of the acquired time-sequenced images of the postharvest apples includes 4440 images and is available online. Mask R-CNN demonstrated the best performance and achieved 98.81% of the mean Average Precision (mAP) for apples and 43.60% of the mAP for postharvest decay zones.

Induction machines suffer from low torque densities due to larger size and increased losses incurred in the rotor bars making these the performance objectives to be improved through optimization. Communicating through objective functions (OFs), a performance model to rapidly evaluate design parameters coupled with genetic algorithm (GA) can be used to produce an optimal rotor bar; however, conventional OF modeling may introduce function bias or complex coefficient calculations leading to dominated objectives, stalling and premature convergence leading to an unoptimized solution. In this paper, the rotor bar of a squirrel cage induction machine (SCIM) is modeled by a permeance based equivalent circuit model (ECM) creating a link between the rotor slot geometry and equivalent circuit parameters. The model considering skin and slotting effect as well as slot, zigzag, tooth top and overhang leakage reactance effects coupled with a multi- objective GA through novel hyperbolic tangent based OFs to optimize the rotor bar geometry. The optimal rotor bar shape proposed offers increased output torque and reduced total machine losses resulting in a higher operating efficiency.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Oct. 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9589524/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9589524/","publicationDate":"13 Oct. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"13 November 2021","conferenceDate":"13-16 Oct. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Torque and Loss Optimized Rotor Bar Design for an Induction Machine Using a Nondominated Genetic Algorithm Through Objective Function Modeling","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Torque and Loss Optimized Rotor Bar Design for an Induction Machine Using a Nondominated Genetic Algorithm Through Objective Function Modeling","confLoc":"Toronto, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"TF-012904.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.091027S","chronDate":"13-16 Oct. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9588332","isNumber":"9589036","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9588332","xplore-issue":"9589036","articleId":"9589524","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":9589568,"authors":[{"name":"Akishi Takeyama","affiliation":["Electrical, Electronic, and Communication Engineering, Faculty of Science and Engineering, Chuo University, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Akishi","lastName":"Takeyama","id":"37088945546"},{"name":"Shota Komatsuzaki","affiliation":["Electrical, Electronic, and Communication Engineering, Faculty of Science and Engineering, Chuo University, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Shota","lastName":"Komatsuzaki","id":"37088945917"},{"name":"Keita Sado","affiliation":["Electrical, Electronic, and Communication Engineering, Faculty of Science and Engineering, Chuo University, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Keita","lastName":"Sado","id":"37088233880"},{"name":"Yuki Nagastu","affiliation":["Electrical, Electronic, and Communication Engineering, Faculty of Science and Engineering, Chuo University, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Yuki","lastName":"Nagastu","id":"37089025319"},{"name":"Hideki Hashimoto","affiliation":["Electrical, Electronic, and Communication Engineering, Faculty of Science and Engineering, Chuo University, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Hideki","lastName":"Hashimoto","id":"37275318500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3554-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-0256-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2577-1647"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"1553-572X"}],"articleNumber":"9589568","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":24},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Industrial electronics","Conferences","Robot sensing systems"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9589568","abstract":"Motor is important device that support the foundation of our lives. For high-precision control of robots, it is necessary to improve the accuracy of the encoder, which is a position sensor. High resolution can be achieved by using multi-pole magnets. However, the absolute angle is lost. In the previous research, eccentric rotation was used to achieve high resolution without loss of absolute angle. But the number of sensors to be used increases for higher resolution by further increasing the number of poles. When the number of sensors is reduced in relation to the number of magnetic poles of the magnet, a large angle error will occur. In this paper, we proposed a method to calculate the angle when the number of sensors is reduced by using Long Short-Term Memory. The proposed method reduces the large angle error when the number of sensors is reduced.","doi":"10.1109/IECON48115.2021.9589568","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"IECON 2021 \u2013 47th Annual Conference of the IEEE Industrial Electronics Society","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IECON48115.2021.9589568","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9589036","displayPublicationTitle":"IECON 2021 \u2013 47th Annual Conference of the IEEE Industrial Electronics Society","pdfPath":"/iel7/9588332/9589036/09589568.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Development of a Magnetic Absolute Encoder Using Eccentric Structure and Long Short-Term Memory","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9589568/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Development of a Magnetic Absolute Encoder Using Eccentric Structure and Long Short-Term Memory","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9589568/","publicationDate":"13 Oct. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"13 November 2021","conferenceDate":"13-16 Oct. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Oct. 2021","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Development of a Magnetic Absolute Encoder Using Eccentric Structure and Long Short-Term Memory","confLoc":"Toronto, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"TF-016047.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062691S","chronDate":"13-16 Oct. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9588332","isNumber":"9589036","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9588332","xplore-issue":"9589036","articleId":"9589568","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":9589609,"authors":[{"name":"Pouria Qashqai","affiliation":["\u00c9cole de Technologie Sup\u00e9rieure (\u00c9TS), Montreal, Canada"],"firstName":"Pouria","lastName":"Qashqai","id":"37085699066"},{"name":"Rawad Zgheib","affiliation":["Institut de recherche Hydro Quebec, Hydro Qu\u00e9bec, Varenne, Canada"],"firstName":"Rawad","lastName":"Zgheib","id":"37827413000"},{"name":"Kamal Al-Haddad","affiliation":["\u00c9cole de Technologie Sup\u00e9rieure (\u00c9TS), Montreal, Canada"],"firstName":"Kamal","lastName":"Al-Haddad","id":"37274676300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3554-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-0256-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2577-1647"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"1553-572X"}],"articleNumber":"9589609","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":30},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Deep learning","Buck converters","Computational modeling","Training data","Switches","Mathematical models"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["black-box modeling","power electronic converters","gated recurrent unit","long-short term memory","deep learning","machine learning","neural networks"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9589609","abstract":"Considering the vast application of Power Electronic Converters (PEC) in numerous modern technologies, modeling their behavior is of immense importance. These components are non-linear and modeling their precise behavior requires a relatively substantial amount of computational resources. In this paper, a modeling method based on Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) networks is proposed that is capable of modeling PECs with the aid of machine learning. Furthermore, the precise datasheets of many commercial over-the-shelf converters are not readily available. Thus, the proposed method is a black-box modeling method that only requires the input and output signals of a converter to model its dynamic behavior. For a performance comparison, the proposed GRU-based method, as well as another similar method based on Long-short Term Memory (LSTM) networks, are used to model a voltage-regulated variable-load DC/DC buck converter. A detailed switching model of the aforementioned converter is simulated in Matlab/Simulink environment to generate the required datasets. This model is also used as a reference for comparison. Ultimately, both of the models are exported to Matlab/Simulink after training to be simulated and assessed.","doi":"10.1109/IECON48115.2021.9589609","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"IECON 2021 \u2013 47th Annual Conference of the IEEE Industrial Electronics Society","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IECON48115.2021.9589609","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9589036","displayPublicationTitle":"IECON 2021 \u2013 47th Annual Conference of the IEEE Industrial Electronics Society","pdfPath":"/iel7/9588332/9589036/09589609.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"GRU and LSTM Comparison for Black-Box Modeling of Power Electronic Converters","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9589609/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"GRU and LSTM Comparison for Black-Box Modeling of Power Electronic Converters","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9589609/","publicationDate":"13 Oct. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2021","conferenceDate":"13-16 Oct. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Oct. 2021","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"GRU and LSTM Comparison for Black-Box Modeling of Power Electronic Converters","confLoc":"Toronto, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"TF-020214.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056918S","chronDate":"13-16 Oct. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9588332","isNumber":"9589036","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9588332","xplore-issue":"9589036","articleId":"9589609","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":9589614,"authors":[{"name":"Matti K\u00e4yr\u00e4","affiliation":["Computing Sciences, Tampere University, Finland"],"firstName":"Matti","lastName":"K\u00e4yr\u00e4","id":"37088526677"},{"name":"Timo D.

The motivation is improving the design productivity by better source code expressiveness, increased abstraction level in design entry, or improved automation. The survey focuses on Chisel that is one of the most potential High Level Language (HLL) based design frameworks. We include 26 papers that report implementations ranging from IP blocks to complete chips. The result is that functional programming languages are viable for SoC design and can also be deployed in production use. However, Chisel does not increase the abstraction level in a similar way as High Level Synthesis (HLS), since it is used to create circuit generators instead of direct descriptions. Additional benefit is that Chisel offloads user effort from control and connectivity structures, and makes reusability and configurability improved over traditional Hardware Description Language (HDL) designs.","doi":"10.1109/IECON48115.2021.9589614","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IECON48115.2021.9589614","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9589036","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","displayPublicationTitle":"IECON 2021 \u2013 47th Annual Conference of the IEEE Industrial Electronics Society","pdfPath":"/iel7/9588332/9589036/09589614.pdf","publicationTitle":"IECON 2021 \u2013 47th Annual Conference of the IEEE Industrial Electronics Society","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9589614","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Productivity","Industrial electronics","Codes","Tools","Generators","System-on-chip","Functional programming"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Survey","RTL Design","HDL","Chisel","FPGA","ASIC"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Survey on System-on-a-Chip Design Using Chisel HW Construction Language","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Oct. 2021","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"13-16 Oct. 2021","publicationDate":"13 Oct. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9589614/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9589614/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Survey on System-on-a-Chip Design Using Chisel HW Construction Language","confLoc":"Toronto, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"TF-028029.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.093751S","chronDate":"13-16 Oct. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9588332","isNumber":"9589036","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9588332","xplore-issue":"9589036","articleId":"9589614","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-23"},{"_id":9589618,"authors":[{"name":"Georgeta Bauer","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering Dalhousie University, Halifax, Canada"],"firstName":"Georgeta","lastName":"Bauer","id":"37086929278"},{"name":"Ya-Jun Pan","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering Dalhousie University, Halifax, Canada"],"firstName":"Ya-Jun","lastName":"Pan","id":"37401472400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3554-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-0256-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2577-1647"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"1553-572X"}],"articleNumber":"9589618","dbTime":"1 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":7},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9589618","abstract":"The unprecedented and exponentially growing global senior population is creating an exorbitant and unmet demand for physical rehabilitation. Telerehabilitation with robotic exoskeletons is an emerging, and compelling complementary rehabilitation modality. Some challenges are to overcome the effects of dynamic modeling uncertainties and ensure good tracking performance, stability, safe and compliant motion, and a high degree of telepresence between the two remotely-separated human-robot systems in the presence of nonlinearities, human torques, and communication constraints such as time delays. Two control methods were developed: Adaptive Robust Integral Impedance model (ARII) control and Adaptive Robust Integral Radial Basis Function Neural Networks-based Impedance model (RBFNN-I) control. Both methods implement compliant behaviour using an adjustable impedance model and revealed desirable performance. A novel human torque regulator (HTR) was developed, which provides higher fidelity telepresence for the therapist compared to existing methods to enhance the safety and perception of the closed-loop physical interaction. Unilateral and bilateral simulations were carried out using two-degrees-of-freedom (2-DOF) exoskeletons models and experiments were performed using single-joint robots. Excellent tracking performance, telepresence, and stability was achieved in the presence of large, variable and asymmetric time delays and human torques under numerous parameters variations.","doi":"10.1109/IECON48115.2021.9589618","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","displayPublicationTitle":"IECON 2021 \u2013 47th Annual Conference of the IEEE Industrial Electronics Society","pdfPath":"/iel7/9588332/9589036/09589618.pdf","publicationTitle":"IECON 2021 \u2013 47th Annual Conference of the IEEE Industrial Electronics Society","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IECON48115.2021.9589618","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9589036","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive and Neural Network-based Control Methods Comparison using different Human Torque Synthesis for Upper-limb Robotic Exoskeletons","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Adaptation models","Torque","Telepresence","Adaptive systems","Tracking","Exoskeletons","Dynamics"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Adaptive control","Radial basis function neural networks","Impedance control","Exoskeletons","Telerobotics","Rehabilitation","Human-robot interaction"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9589618/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Oct. 2021","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive and Neural Network-based Control Methods Comparison using different Human Torque Synthesis for Upper-limb Robotic Exoskeletons","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9589618/","publicationDate":"13 Oct. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"13 November 2021","conferenceDate":"13-16 Oct. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000038","fundingName":"Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004073","fundingName":"Killam Trusts"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100010450","fundingName":"Nova"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive and Neural Network-based Control Methods Comparison using different Human Torque Synthesis for Upper-limb Robotic Exoskeletons","confLoc":"Toronto, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"TF-006629.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077498S","chronDate":"13-16 Oct. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9588332","isNumber":"9589036","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9588332","xplore-issue":"9589036","articleId":"9589618","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":9589722,"authors":[{"name":"Zhonghao Huang","affiliation":["Shenzhen Institute of Advanced Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shenzhen, China","Xinjiang University, Urumqi, China"],"firstName":"Zhonghao","lastName":"Huang","id":"37089022252"},{"name":"Yimin Zhou","affiliation":["Shenzhen Institute of Advanced Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shenzhen, China"],"firstName":"Yimin","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37085357270"},{"name":"Xingyao Yang","affiliation":["Xinjiang University, Urumqi, China"],"firstName":"Xingyao","lastName":"Yang","id":"38022424900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3554-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-0256-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2577-1647"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"1553-572X"}],"articleNumber":"9589722","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":15},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Knowledge engineering","Industrial electronics","Image coding","Generative adversarial networks","Feature extraction","Generators"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Online knowledge distillation","Layer-wise greedy strategy","Generative adversarial network","Model compression","Image classification"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9589722","abstract":"Knowledge distillation is one of the model compression techniques, where the key challenge is how to extract rich and general knowledge from teacher models, thus reducing the performance gap between the student models and the teacher models.

This paper designs an online knowledge distillation based on multi-stage multi-generative adversarial network (MS-MGAN), which enables the student model and the teacher model to learn together in multiple stages. First, the teacher model training is divided into several stages, and the training results of each stage are used to guide the student model training. Second, the student model is based on the convolutional block for layer-wise greedy training. Then, the generative adversarial network is integrated into the multi-stage training, with each convolutional block of the student model as the generator and the corresponding block of the teacher model as the discriminator, so that the student model can better follow and even surpass the performance of the teacher model. As demonstrated on several benchmarks, the proposed method can achieves surprising satisfied results, even outperforming the teacher model on some tasks.","doi":"10.1109/IECON48115.2021.9589722","pdfPath":"/iel7/9588332/9589036/09589722.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","displayPublicationTitle":"IECON 2021 \u2013 47th Annual Conference of the IEEE Industrial Electronics Society","publicationTitle":"IECON 2021 \u2013 47th Annual Conference of the IEEE Industrial Electronics Society","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IECON48115.2021.9589722","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9589036","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Online Knowledge Distillation Based on Multi-stage Multi-generative Adversarial Network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9589722/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Oct. 2021","displayDocTitle":"Online Knowledge Distillation Based on Multi-stage Multi-generative Adversarial Network","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"13 November 2021","publicationDate":"13 Oct. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9589722/","conferenceDate":"13-16 Oct. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Online Knowledge Distillation Based on Multi-stage Multi-generative Adversarial Network","confLoc":"Toronto, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"TF-015571.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070024S","chronDate":"13-16 Oct. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9588332","isNumber":"9589036","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9588332","xplore-issue":"9589036","articleId":"9589722","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":9589728,"authors":[{"name":"Thyago Estrabis","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Program, Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil"],"firstName":"Thyago","lastName":"Estrabis","id":"37088372780"},{"name":"Matheus Pelzl","affiliation":["Federal University of Mato Grosso do Sul, Campo Grande, Brazil"],"firstName":"Matheus","lastName":"Pelzl","id":"37089023349"},{"name":"Raymundo Cordero","affiliation":["Grad.

Usually, vector control techniques require representing the stator currents in an orthogonal \u03b1\u00df reference system through Clarke transformation. However, problems such as aging, high temperatures and errors in the conditioning circuits distort the current signals received by the data acquisition system (DAQ) of the motor drive. Those distortions produce current measurement errors that affect the motor drive performance. This paper analyses the application of an auto-regressive neural network (AANN) to compensate for the measurement errors of the three-phase stator currents. The three stator currents of a three-phase motor are sensed to have data redundancy, as the sum of these currents is zero. AANN estimates the actual values of the stationary \u03b1\u00df stator currents based on the distorted three-phase current signals. The compensation performance considering different AANN topologies is analyzed. Simulation results show that AANN allows compensating for the current measurement distortion. Low number of artificial neurons in the AANN hidden layers limits the compensation accuracy. However, a high number of neurons in the hidden layer also reduces the compensation performance due to over-fitting.","doi":"10.1109/IECON48115.2021.9589728","pdfPath":"/iel7/9588332/9589036/09589728.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","displayPublicationTitle":"IECON 2021 \u2013 47th Annual Conference of the IEEE Industrial Electronics Society","publicationTitle":"IECON 2021 \u2013 47th Annual Conference of the IEEE Industrial Electronics Society","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IECON48115.2021.9589728","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9589036","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of Measurement Error Compensation of Stationary \u03b1\u03b2 Stator Currents done through Auto-Associative Neural Network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9589728/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Oct. 2021","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of Measurement Error Compensation of Stationary \u03b1\u03b2 Stator Currents done through Auto-Associative Neural Network","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2021","publicationDate":"13 Oct. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9589728/","conferenceDate":"13-16 Oct. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of Measurement Error Compensation of Stationary \u03b1\u03b2 Stator Currents done through Auto-Associative Neural Network","confLoc":"Toronto, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"TF-029203.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067088S","chronDate":"13-16 Oct. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9588332","isNumber":"9589036","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9588332","xplore-issue":"9589036","articleId":"9589728","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":9589735,"authors":[{"name":"Fei Long","affiliation":["School of Automation, China University of Geosciences, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Fei","lastName":"Long","id":"37086313636"},{"name":"Yong He","affiliation":["School of Automation, China University of Geosciences, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Yong","lastName":"He","id":"37272942500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3554-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-0256-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2577-1647"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"1553-572X"}],"articleNumber":"9589735","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":27},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Industrial electronics","Sufficient conditions","Conferences","Stability criteria","Neural networks","Delays","Linear matrix inequalities"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Stability","neural networks","time-varying delay","time-varying delay polynomial","negativity-determination method"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9589735","abstract":"This paper presents an improved stability condition for neural networks with a time-varying delay.

The application of this negativity-determination method to neural networks with a time-varying delay leads to a less conservative stability criterion, which is illustrated with an example.","doi":"10.1109/IECON48115.2021.9589735","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"IECON 2021 \u2013 47th Annual Conference of the IEEE Industrial Electronics Society","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IECON48115.2021.9589735","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9589036","displayPublicationTitle":"IECON 2021 \u2013 47th Annual Conference of the IEEE Industrial Electronics Society","pdfPath":"/iel7/9588332/9589036/09589735.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Stability Analysis for Delayed Neural Networks Based on A Sufficient and Necessary Condition on Polynomial Inequalities<sup>*</sup>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9589735/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Stability Analysis for Delayed Neural Networks Based on A Sufficient and Necessary Condition on Polynomial Inequalities<sup>*</sup>","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9589735/","publicationDate":"13 Oct. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2021","conferenceDate":"13-16 Oct. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Oct. 2021","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Stability Analysis for Delayed Neural Networks Based on A Sufficient and Necessary Condition on Polynomial Inequalities<sup>*</sup>","confLoc":"Toronto, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"TF-025364.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.079925S","chronDate":"13-16 Oct. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9588332","isNumber":"9589036","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9588332","xplore-issue":"9589036","articleId":"9589735","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":9589784,"authors":[{"name":"Qiguo Shi","affiliation":["School of Control Science and Engineering, Shandong University, Jinan, China"],"firstName":"Qiguo","lastName":"Shi","id":"37088923264"},{"name":"Chunshui Du","affiliation":["School of Control Science and Engineering, Shandong University, Jinan, China"],"firstName":"Chunshui","lastName":"Du","id":"37545298900"},{"name":"Yongchao Sun","affiliation":["State Grid Anshan Electric Power Supply Company, Anshan, China"],"firstName":"Yongchao","lastName":"Sun","id":"37087005151"},{"name":"Wenlu Cai","affiliation":["Institute of Novel Semiconductor, Shandong University, Jinan, China"],"firstName":"Wenlu","lastName":"Cai","id":"37088923981"},{"name":"Aiping Wang","affiliation":["Shandong Jiangxin Intelligent Technology Co., Ltd, Jinan, China"],"firstName":"Aiping","lastName":"Wang","id":"37089025582"},{"name":"Dezheng Chui","affiliation":["Shandong Aotai Electric Co., Ltd, Jinan, China"],"firstName":"Dezheng","lastName":"Chui","id":"37089023999"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3554-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-0256-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2577-1647"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"1553-572X"}],"articleNumber":"9589784","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":32},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Damping","Industrial electronics","Adaptation models","Time-frequency analysis","Microgrids","Synchronous generators","Stability analysis"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["microgrid inverter","adaptive control","virtual synchronous generator (VSG)"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9589784","abstract":"When the islanded microgrid is subject to a large power disturbance, the fixed-parameter virtual synchronous generator (VSG) control can provide inertia and damping for the system, but it cannot guarantee the frequency adjustment performance and the control flexibility is poor.

In particular, the proposed method introduces the frequency deviation and frequency change rate into the VSG virtual parameters, adaptively adjusting the inertia and damping parameters of VSG system to improve the frequency stability of microgrid when power suddenly changed.

A lot of restoration methods were proposed for the case when linear degradation operator and i.i.d. Gaussian likelihood is assumed. However, such methods are known not to generalize well. They show a sub-par performance on real data, for which the actual degradation model is neither linear nor even exactly known. The state-of-the-art machine learning allows for overcoming this issue and learn a restoration model to the real data. The main drawback of such approaches is overfitting since to learn an inverse mapping between the low-quality and high-quality samples, they rely entirely on data. They do not utilize limited but existing knowledge of how degradation was performed. In this paper, we study learned gradient descent based image restoration and synthesis. Both linear and non-linear known restoration problems are considered, and research on how a known degradation model may be incorporated in a learned gradient-based restoration procedure is provided. Our results demonstrate that explicit usage of the degradation model and its learned linear and non-linear approximations boost restoration quality compared to a baseline without this feature.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Oct. 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9589797/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9589797/","publicationDate":"13 Oct. 2021","conferenceDate":"13-16 Oct. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2021","displayDocTitle":"Learned Gradient Descent Performance in Bicubic Super-Resolution Task","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Learned Gradient Descent Performance in Bicubic Super-Resolution Task","confLoc":"Toronto, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"TF-027448.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.168795S","chronDate":"13-16 Oct. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9588332","isNumber":"9589036","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9588332","xplore-issue":"9589036","articleId":"9589797","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":9589975,"authors":[{"name":"Prabhat Ranjan Bana","affiliation":["Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Trondheim, Norway"],"firstName":"Prabhat Ranjan","lastName":"Bana","id":"37086833566"},{"name":"Mohammad Amin","affiliation":["Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Trondheim, Norway"],"firstName":"Mohammad","lastName":"Amin","id":"37085395466"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3554-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-0256-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2577-1647"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"1553-572X"}],"articleNumber":"9589975","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":30},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9589975","abstract":"The standard vector control is widely used for grid-connected voltage source converters (VSCs), however, the inability to satisfactorily operate at the desired level under different dynamic scenarios and grid conditions limit its application. This paper presents an artificial neural network (ANN) based vector control for the grid-connected VSCs. The Multilayer Perceptron-Recurrent Neural Network (MP-RNN) approach is used in this work which generates the reference current for the current controller of the VSC. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed control, the MP-RNN-based vector control is implemented for a grid-connected VSC in the MATLAB/Simulink environment and the MP-RNN structure is trained by the Levenberg-Marquardt based backpropagation algorithm. Simulation results are presented and compared with the vector control with and without the proposed ANN-aided control. The results clearly show that the proposed control has a better dynamic performance in damping the oscillation introduced by the dc-link dynamics of the VSC. Further, the dynamic performance of the proposed control has been verified with a model implemented in the OPAL-RT environment considering different dynamic test cases.","doi":"10.1109/IECON48115.2021.9589975","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","displayPublicationTitle":"IECON 2021 \u2013 47th Annual Conference of the IEEE Industrial Electronics Society","pdfPath":"/iel7/9588332/9589036/09589975.pdf","publicationTitle":"IECON 2021 \u2013 47th Annual Conference of the IEEE Industrial Electronics Society","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IECON48115.2021.9589975","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9589036","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Vector Control of Grid-tied VSC using Multilayer Perceptron-Recurrent Neural Network","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Damping","Workability","Simulation","Artificial neural networks","Backpropagation algorithms","Nonhomogeneous media","Real-time systems"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Artificial neural network (ANN)","Multilayer Perceptron-Recurrent Neural Network (MP-RNN)","Damping","Voltage oscillation","Voltage source inverter (VSC)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9589975/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Oct. 2021","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Vector Control of Grid-tied VSC using Multilayer Perceptron-Recurrent Neural Network","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9589975/","publicationDate":"13 Oct. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"13 November 2021","conferenceDate":"13-16 Oct. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Vector Control of Grid-tied VSC using Multilayer Perceptron-Recurrent Neural Network","confLoc":"Toronto, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"TF-003085.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05325S","chronDate":"13-16 Oct. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9588332","isNumber":"9589036","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9588332","xplore-issue":"9589036","articleId":"9589975","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"}]
