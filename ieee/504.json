For frequency selective channels, we demonstrate that MCMC-based equalizers yield excellent performance even for severe inter-symbol-interference (ISI) channels. The MCMC equalizer achieves significant performance gain over minimum mean square error (MMSE) linear equalizer and performs closely to the optimal maximum a posteriori probability (MAP) equalizer.

Moving beyond the traditional listen-before-talk paradigm, we propose a cognitive access methodology that exploits the feedback channel in two-way primary communication links for better spectrum utility and protection of primary users against secondary interference. We let secondary users dynamically control access and power based on primary ACK/NACK messages. We develop an optimal access policy applicable to multiple secondary user pairs. We also devise a distributed power control policy for multiple secondary users to maximize their individual throughput without significant cumulative interference to the primary link. Our distributed access and power control schemes can effectively provide good SU performance and primary protection without requiring central coordination.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITA.2009.5044927","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5044910","startPage":"85","endPage":"89","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Information Theory and Applications Workshop","pdfPath":"/iel5/4976837/5044910/05044927.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Feedback-based access and power control for distributed multiuser cognitive networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5044927/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-13 Feb. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5044927/","displayDocTitle":"Feedback-based access and power control for distributed multiuser cognitive networks","conferenceDate":"8-13 Feb. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2009","accessionNumber":"10702537","dateOfInsertion":"29 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Feedback-based access and power control for distributed multiuser cognitive networks","confLoc":"La Jolla, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"Ding.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050833S","chronDate":"8-13 Feb. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4976837","isNumber":"5044910","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4976837","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"5044910","articleId":"5044927","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5044928,"authors":[{"name":"Onur Sahin","affiliation":["Dept. of ECE, Polytechnic Institute of NYU","Dept. of ECE, Polytechnic Institute of NYU, USA"],"firstName":"Onur","lastName":"Sahin","id":"37304614500"},{"name":"Elza Erkip","affiliation":["Dept. of ECE, Polytechnic Institute of NYU","Dept. of ECE, Polytechnic Institute of NYU, USA"],"firstName":"Elza","lastName":"Erkip","id":"37266656500"},{"name":"Osvaldo Simeone","affiliation":["Dept, of ECE, New Jersey Institute of Technology"],"firstName":"Osvaldo","lastName":"Simeone","id":"37269653500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3990-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5044928","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":43,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":371},"abstract":"This paper discusses the impact of relaying in interference-limited networks by studying a two-user Gaussian interference channel with a relay (ICR). Various models for relay reception and transmission are possible: The relay can receive and transmit in the same band as the sources (i.e., in-band relay reception/transmission), or else relay reception, or both reception and transmission, can take place over orthogonal links of limited capacity (i.e., out-of-band relay reception or/ and transmission). In all scenarios, the selection of either signal relaying, interference forwarding or a combination thereof for the relay operation is identified as a common design choice. While signal relaying enables the destination to obtain a stronger desired signal or additional information, interference forwarding helps removing part of the interference. Important scenarios under which signal relaying and interference forwarding are optimal are identified, including cognitive relaying where the relay is unaware of the source codebooks and out-of band relaying, both under certain modified strong interference conditions and the latter under additional capacity constraints on the orthogonal relay links.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Interference channels","Integrated circuit modeling","Decoding","Signal processing","Integrated circuit noise","Paper technology","Signal design","Interference constraints","Communication networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Gaussian channels","radiofrequency interference","relays","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["two-user Gaussian interference channel","relay reception","relay transmission","orthogonal relay links"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ITA.2009.5044928","publicationTitle":"2009 Information Theory and Applications Workshop","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Information Theory and Applications Workshop","pdfPath":"/iel5/4976837/5044910/05044928.pdf","startPage":"90","endPage":"95","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5044910","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITA.2009.5044928","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Interference channel with a relay: Models, relaying strategies, bounds","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5044928","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Interference channel with a relay: Models, relaying strategies, bounds","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5044928/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5044928/","accessionNumber":"10702538","conferenceDate":"8-13 Feb. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"29 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-13 Feb. 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Interference channel with a relay: Models, relaying strategies, bounds","confLoc":"La Jolla, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"Erkip.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.094116S","chronDate":"8-13 Feb. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4976837","isNumber":"5044910","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4976837","citationCount":"43","xplore-issue":"5044910","articleId":"5044928","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5044934,"authors":[{"name":"Sibi Raj Bhaskaran","affiliation":["Centre of Ultra-Broadband Information Networks (CUBIN), Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Melbourne, Parkville, VIC, Australia"],"firstName":"Sibi Raj","lastName":"Bhaskaran","id":"37320703400"},{"name":"Stephen V.

All transmitters have an average transmit power constraint, the same for all transmitters. We solve this nonconvex problem by identifying some underlying convex structure. In particular, we characterize the maximum sum rate of the network, and show that there are essentially two possible states at the optimal solution depending on the cross-gain between the links, and/or the average power constraint: the first is a wideband (WB) state, in which all links interfere with each other, and the second is a frequency division multiplexing (FDM) state, in which all links operate in orthogonal frequency bands. The FDM state is optimal if the cross-gain between the links is above 1 / radic2. If the cross-gain is below 1 / radic2, then FDM is still optimal provided the average power of the links is sufficiently high. Assuming that isin < 1 / radic2, we can say that the WB state occurs when the average power level is low (relative to the noise and the cross-gain factor between the links), but as we increase the average power level from low to high, there is a smooth transition from the WB state to the FDM state: For intermediate average power levels, the optimal configuration is a mixture, with some fraction of the bandwidth in the WB state, and the other fraction in the FDM state. This work has applications to DSL, as well as to wireless networks.","doi":"10.1109/ITA.2009.5044934","publicationTitle":"2009 Information Theory and Applications Workshop","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Information Theory and Applications Workshop","pdfPath":"/iel5/4976837/5044910/05044934.pdf","startPage":"130","endPage":"137","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITA.2009.5044934","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5044910","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Maximizing the sum rate in symmetric networks of interfering links","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5044934","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-13 Feb. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5044934/","displayDocTitle":"Maximizing the sum rate in symmetric networks of interfering links","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2009","accessionNumber":"10702544","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5044934/","conferenceDate":"8-13 Feb. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"29 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Maximizing the sum rate in symmetric networks of interfering links","confLoc":"La Jolla, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"Hanly.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061581S","chronDate":"8-13 Feb. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4976837","isNumber":"5044910","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4976837","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5044910","articleId":"5044934","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5044935,"authors":[{"name":"Robert C.

In practice, however, impairments such as interference and analog circuit nonlinearities are difficult to model in a simple and tractable framework. Moreover, these impairments are in flux due to environmental factors. This paper summarizes an online machine learning approach to parameter selection through the real-time capturing of performance related data. Online learning is advantageous, not only because changes in the system model can be captured in the data observations, but also for its ability to learn system operation details not provided by current system models. A modified version of k-nearest neighbor is developed to enable both the real-time capture of training data and the performance criterion for physical layer adaptation.","doi":"10.1109/ITA.2009.5044935","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITA.2009.5044935","startPage":"138","endPage":"140","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Information Theory and Applications Workshop","pdfPath":"/iel5/4976837/5044910/05044935.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 Information Theory and Applications Workshop","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5044910","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An online learning framework for link adaptation in wireless networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"8-13 Feb. 2009","displayDocTitle":"An online learning framework for link adaptation in wireless networks","conferenceDate":"8-13 Feb. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"29 May 2009","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5044935/","accessionNumber":"10702545","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5044935/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An online learning framework for link adaptation in wireless networks","confLoc":"La Jolla, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"Heath.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06005S","chronDate":"8-13 Feb. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4976837","isNumber":"5044910","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4976837","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"5044910","articleId":"5044935","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5044937,"authors":[{"name":"Javad Kazemitabar","affiliation":["Department of EECS, University of California, Irvine, USA"],"firstName":"Javad","lastName":"Kazemitabar","id":"37320289900"},{"name":"Hamid Jafarkhani","affiliation":["Department of EECS, University of California, Irvine, USA"],"firstName":"Hamid","lastName":"Jafarkhani","id":"37274579200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3990-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5044937","dbTime":"19 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":27,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":247},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Performance analysis","Multiuser detection","Receiving antennas","Block codes","Transmitting antennas","Maximum likelihood decoding","Space time codes","Maximum likelihood detection","Java","Antenna arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["block codes","multiuser detection","orthogonal codes","space-time codes","transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiple antenna","multi-user detection","quasi-orthogonal space-time block codes","Alamouti","transmit antennas","maximum-likelihood decoding"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["multi-user detection","space-time codes","Alamouti code","quasi-orthogonal space-time block code","diversity"]}],"abstract":"We derive the diversity order of some multiple antenna multi-user cancellation and detection schemes.

We compare the performance of this distributed compressive spectrum sensing scheme with a compressive spectrum sensing scheme at a single CR and show the performance gains obtained from spatial diversity.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed compressive wide-band spectrum sensing","publicationTitle":"2009 Information Theory and Applications Workshop","doi":"10.1109/ITA.2009.5044942","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Information Theory and Applications Workshop","pdfPath":"/iel5/4976837/5044910/05044942.pdf","startPage":"178","endPage":"183","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITA.2009.5044942","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5044910","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5044942","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5044942/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-13 Feb. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Distributed compressive wide-band spectrum sensing","conferenceDate":"8-13 Feb. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5044942/","dateOfInsertion":"29 May 2009","publicationDate":"Feb. 2009","accessionNumber":"10702552","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed compressive wide-band spectrum sensing","confLoc":"La Jolla, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"Leus.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059775S","chronDate":"8-13 Feb. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4976837","isNumber":"5044910","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4976837","citationCount":"55","xplore-issue":"5044910","articleId":"5044942","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5044944,"authors":[{"name":"Chun Kin Au-Yeung","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA"],"firstName":"Chun Kin","lastName":"Au-Yeung","id":"38275255400"},{"name":"Ali Jalali","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA"],"firstName":"Ali","lastName":"Jalali","id":"37300412300"},{"name":"David J.

One key criteria to successfully implement a multi-site cooperative transmission system is the need to quantize an expanded set of channels. To maintain quantization precision, codebook size needs to scale roughly exponentially with the number of total antennas and renders quantizing the expanded channel set a computationally demanding task. In this paper, we identify a connection between noncoherent communication and the phase invariant property of beamforming vectors. We leverage techniques from the noncoherent communication literature to design an efficient beamforming vector quantization scheme. Our proposed scheme has a quantization complexity that grows linearly with number of antennas. Simulation results indicate this method has slightly more quantization distortion than RVQ while being significantly more efficient.","doi":"10.1109/ITA.2009.5044944","publicationTitle":"2009 Information Theory and Applications Workshop","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Information Theory and Applications Workshop","pdfPath":"/iel5/4976837/5044910/05044944.pdf","startPage":"187","endPage":"190","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITA.2009.5044944","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5044910","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Insights into feedback and feedback signaling for beamformer design","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5044944","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-13 Feb. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5044944/","displayDocTitle":"Insights into feedback and feedback signaling for beamformer design","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2009","accessionNumber":"10702554","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5044944/","conferenceDate":"8-13 Feb. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"29 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Insights into feedback and feedback signaling for beamformer design","confLoc":"La Jolla, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"Love.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049548S","chronDate":"8-13 Feb. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4976837","isNumber":"5044910","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4976837","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5044910","articleId":"5044944","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5044945,"authors":[{"name":"Daniel E.

In theory, CS allows the approximation of the readings from a sensor field with excellent accuracy, while collecting only a small fraction of them at a data gathering point. However, the conditions under which CS performs well are not necessarily met in practice. CS requires a suitable transformation that makes the signal sparse in its domain. Also, the transformation of the data given by the routing protocol and network topology and the sparse representation of the signal have to be incoherent, which is not straightforward to achieve in real networks. In this work we address the data gathering problem in WSNs, where routing is used in conjunction with CS to transport random projections of the data. We analyze synthetic and real data sets and compare the results against those of random sampling. In doing so, we consider a number of popular transformations and we find that, with real data sets, none of them are able to sparsify the data while being at the same time incoherent with respect to the routing matrix. The obtained performance is thus not as good as expected and finding a suitable transformation with good sparsification and incoherence properties remains an open problem for data gathering in static WSNs.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the interplay between routing and signal representation for Compressive Sensing in wireless sensor networks","publicationTitle":"2009 Information Theory and Applications Workshop","doi":"10.1109/ITA.2009.5044947","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Information Theory and Applications Workshop","pdfPath":"/iel5/4976837/5044910/05044947.pdf","startPage":"206","endPage":"215","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITA.2009.5044947","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5044910","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5044947","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5044947/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-13 Feb. 2009","displayDocTitle":"On the interplay between routing and signal representation for Compressive Sensing in wireless sensor networks","conferenceDate":"8-13 Feb. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5044947/","dateOfInsertion":"29 May 2009","publicationDate":"Feb. 2009","accessionNumber":"10702557","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the interplay between routing and signal representation for Compressive Sensing in wireless sensor networks","confLoc":"La Jolla, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"Masiero.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.136378S","chronDate":"8-13 Feb. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4976837","isNumber":"5044910","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4976837","citationCount":"92","xplore-issue":"5044910","articleId":"5044947","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-13"},{"_id":5044956,"authors":[{"name":"David G.

In this paper, we analyse the trapping sets of protograph-based LDPC convolutional codes. LDPC convolutional codes have been shown to be capable of achieving the same capacity-approaching performance as LDPC block codes with iterative message-passing decoding. Further, it has been shown that some ensembles of LDPC convolutional codes are asymptotically good, in the sense that the average free distance grows linearly with constraint length. Here, asymptotic methods are used to calculate a lower bound on the trapping set growth rates for several ensembles of regular asymptotically good protograph-based LDPC convolutional codes.

After describing these various challenges we will describe some of the possible methods for meeting these challenges.","doi":"10.1109/ITA.2009.5044964","publicationTitle":"2009 Information Theory and Applications Workshop","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Information Theory and Applications Workshop","pdfPath":"/iel5/4976837/5044910/05044964.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITA.2009.5044964","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5044910","startPage":"323","endPage":"333","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Technical challenges for cognitive radio in the TV white space spectrum","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5044964","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Technical challenges for cognitive radio in the TV white space spectrum","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-13 Feb. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5044964/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"8-13 Feb. 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2009","accessionNumber":"10702573","dateOfInsertion":"29 May 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5044964/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Technical challenges for cognitive radio in the TV white space spectrum","confLoc":"La Jolla, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"Shellhammer.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073925S","chronDate":"8-13 Feb. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4976837","isNumber":"5044910","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4976837","citationCount":"105","xplore-issue":"5044910","articleId":"5044964","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5044965,"authors":[{"name":"Osvaldo Simeone","affiliation":["ECE Department, CWCSPR, Newark, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Osvaldo","lastName":"Simeone","id":"37269653500"},{"name":"Oren Somekh","affiliation":["Department of EE, Princeton University, Princeton, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Oren","lastName":"Somekh","id":"38336938100"},{"name":"Elza Erkip","affiliation":["Department of EE, Polytechnic Institute of New York University, Brooklyn, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Elza","lastName":"Erkip","id":"37266656500"},{"name":"H.

Among available ASD algorithms, the low-complexity chase (LCC) algorithm can achieve a good performance-complexity tradeoff. In addition, the multiplicity of each interpolation point involved in this algorithm is one. These features make the LCC decoding very attractive for practical hardware implementation. In this paper, we present an efficient and high-speed VLSI architecture for the implementation of the LCC decoder. ASD algorithms have two major steps: interpolation and factorization. The high efficiency of the LCC interpolation architecture is achieved by employing a backward interpolation technique, which enables the sharing of intermediate interpolation results. We also show that the factorization step can be eliminated in the case of LCC decoding. From critical path and latency analysis, the LCC decoder can achieve a throughput of several gigabits per second in ASIC implementations. In addition, the LCC decoder requires less than three times the area of a hard-decision decoder that has the same throughput.","publicationTitle":"2009 Information Theory and Applications Workshop","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Information Theory and Applications Workshop","pdfPath":"/iel5/4976837/5044910/05044977.pdf","startPage":"422","endPage":"430","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High-speed VLSI architecture for low-complexity chase soft-decision Reed-Solomon decoding","doi":"10.1109/ITA.2009.5044977","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5044910","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITA.2009.5044977","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5044977","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5044977/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-13 Feb. 2009","displayDocTitle":"High-speed VLSI architecture for low-complexity chase soft-decision Reed-Solomon decoding","dateOfInsertion":"29 May 2009","publicationDate":"Feb. 2009","accessionNumber":"10702586","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"8-13 Feb. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5044977/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High-speed VLSI architecture for low-complexity chase soft-decision Reed-Solomon decoding","confLoc":"La Jolla, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"Zhang.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067125S","chronDate":"8-13 Feb. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4976837","isNumber":"5044910","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4976837","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5044910","articleId":"5044977","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5045930,"authors":[{"name":"Chen-Chien Hsu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Tamkang University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chen-Chien","lastName":"Hsu","id":"37308458400"},{"name":"Chun-Hwui Gao","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Tamkang University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chun-Hwui","lastName":"Gao","id":"37304810300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3782-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5045930","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":164},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Particle swarm optimization","Optimization methods","Search methods","Convergence","Evolutionary computation","Robustness","Computer applications","Computer industry","Marine animals","Educational institutions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convergence","particle swarm optimisation","search problems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["particle swarm optimization","enhanced Nelder-Mead simplex search scheme","multidimensional optimization problem","convergence rate"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Particle swarm optimization","NM simplex search","hybrid optimization","optimization","evolutionary algorithm"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5045930","abstract":"This paper proposes a hybrid approach incorporating an enhanced Nelder-Mead simplex search scheme into a particle swarm optimization (PSO) with the use of a center particle in a swarm for effectively solving multi-dimensional optimization problems.

The challenge of using evolutionary algorithms lies in solving the feature selection problem caused by the number of features. Classification data may contain useless, redundant or misleading features. To increase the classification accuracy, the primary objective is to remove irrelevant features in the feature space and identify the relevant features. Binary particle swarm optimization (BPSO) has been applied successfully in solving feature selection problem. In this paper, two kinds of chaotic maps are embedded in binary particle swarm optimization (BPSO), a logistic map and a tent map, respectively. The purpose of the chaotic maps is to determine the inertia weight of the BPSO. In this study, we propose the chaotic binary particle swarm optimization (CBPSO) method to implement feature selection, and the K-nearest neighbor (K-NN) method with leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) serves as a classifier to evaluate the classification accuracies. The proposed method showed promising results for feature selection with respect to the number of feature subsets. The classification accuracy obtained by the proposed method is superior to ones obtained by the other methods from the literature.","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Conference on Soft Computing in Industrial Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Conference on Soft Computing in Industrial Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4967990/5045920/05045944.pdf","startPage":"107","endPage":"112","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Chaotic maps in binary particle swarm optimization for feature selection","doi":"10.1109/SMCIA.2008.5045944","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5045920","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SMCIA.2008.5045944","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5045944","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5045944/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 June 2008","displayDocTitle":"Chaotic maps in binary particle swarm optimization for feature selection","dateOfInsertion":"29 May 2009","publicationDate":"June 2008","accessionNumber":"10688436","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"25-27 June 2008","htmlLink":"/document/5045944/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Chaotic maps in binary particle swarm optimization for feature selection","confLoc":"Muroran, Japan","sourcePdf":"86a.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055384S","chronDate":"25-27 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4967990","isNumber":"5045920","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4967990","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"5045920","articleId":"5045944","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5045957,"authors":[{"name":"Michihiro Hori","affiliation":["Advanced Technology Research Laboratories, Matsushita Elecrric Indusrrial Company Limited, Soraku-gun, Kyoto, Japan"],"firstName":"Michihiro","lastName":"Hori","id":"37302649400"},{"name":"Michihito Ueda","affiliation":["Advanced Technology Research Laboratories, Matsushita Elecrric Indusrrial Company Limited, Soraku-gun, Kyoto, Japan"],"firstName":"Michihito","lastName":"Ueda","id":"37533427500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3782-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5045957","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":276},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FPGA implementation of a blind source separation system based on stochastic computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Conference on Soft Computing in Industrial Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4967990/5045920/05045957.pdf","startPage":"182","endPage":"187","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Conference on Soft Computing in Industrial Applications","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SMCIA.2008.5045957","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5045920","doi":"10.1109/SMCIA.2008.5045957","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Blind source separation","Stochastic systems","Circuits","Hardware","Artificial neural networks","Stochastic processes","Analog computers","Computer networks","Sensor systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["blind source separation","field programmable gate arrays","neural nets","sequences","stochastic processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FPGA","blind source separation system","stochastic computing system","analog quantity","pulse sequence","neural network"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5045957","abstract":"We have constructed a blind source separation system based on stochastic computing techniques, and have implemented it using an FPGA. In stochastic computing, analog quantities are represented by pulse sequences. The advantage of this method is its simple circuitry. For this reason, stochastic computing systems have been applied to massive circuits such as artificial neural networks. Blind source separation systems are a growing focus of interest. These are systems that infer source signals from mixed signals received by sensors. A blind source system using a neural network model has recently been proposed. However, it is difficult to implement this system in actual circuits, since there are cases in which the values of synaptic weights fall outside the range within which the hardware can process them correctly. Therefore, we propose a blind source separation system that can be implemented in hardware, namely a system in which the values of synaptic weights can be kept within the range that permits the hardware to process them. We then constructed this system based on stochastic computing and investigated it using functional simulations. Finally, we implemented our system on an FPGA board, where we succeeded in separating source signals from mixed signals.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5045957/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 June 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"June 2008","accessionNumber":"10688449","htmlLink":"/document/5045957/","dateOfInsertion":"29 May 2009","conferenceDate":"25-27 June 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"FPGA implementation of a blind source separation system based on stochastic computing","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FPGA implementation of a blind source separation system based on stochastic computing","confLoc":"Muroran, Japan","sourcePdf":"34a.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054995S","chronDate":"25-27 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4967990","isNumber":"5045920","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4967990","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5045920","articleId":"5045957","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":5045959,"authors":[{"name":"Farid arvani","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering, Memorial University of Newfoundland, Saint John's, NEW, Canada"],"firstName":"Farid","lastName":"arvani","id":"37304163400"},{"name":"George K.
