The powder consisted of alumina with 0.05% sodium chloride, and formed a thin layer on a glass strip. These partial arcs were formed if the applied voltage was above a certain minimum and below the voltage for complete flashover. They appeared to be initiated by localized low-current surface breakdowns (scintillations) which could develop into partial arcs having currents of several milli-amperes. It was found that, using Warrington's expression for the voltage drop along an arc, a good correlation was found with the measured arc parameters. However this left a current in the remaining part of the thin layer of damp alumina which could not be explained by ohmic conduction, being too high by more than two orders of magnitude. It appears that `ionization conduction` must be invoked to explain the very much higher apparent conduction occurring in the thin alumina layer. This `ionization conduction` is a phenomenon in which multiple series-parallel micro-flashovers occur between and over the granules in a granulated material.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5128523/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 June 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5128523/","dateOfInsertion":"30 June 2009","publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10736305","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"16","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Partial Arcs above a Damp Contaminated Surface","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Partial Arcs above a Damp Contaminated Surface","sourcePdf":"p0826-li.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.056311S","chronDate":"June  2009","xplore-pub-id":"94","isNumber":"5128488","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"94","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5128488","articleId":"5128523","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":5128529,"authors":[{"name":"B.

The chemical structure can be changed by radiation induced reactions that possibly gives rise to the alteration of characteristics of surface charge, which can enhance the local electrical field and cause surface discharge that damages the insulation. For the safe use of the material, it's necessary to gain a good understanding of radiation effect on surface charge accumulation. In this paper, polyethylene was employed as test sample which was previously irradiated in air up to 100 kGy and then up to 1000 kGy with dose rate of 10 kGy / h by using a \n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">60</sup>\nCo gamma-source. The sample surface was corona charged by applying a series of dc stresses on needle electrode that was set 6 mm above the surface. An electrostatic probe was designed to measure the surface charge density immediately after the charging process. Obtained results show the dependence of surface charge distribution upon the radiation dose varying as a function of the polarity of charging particles. It is suggested that surface charge accumulation depends upon the behavior of localized surface states, which is altered by radiation-induced degradation and cross-linking reactions of the chemical structure.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Dielectrics and Electrical Insulation","pdfPath":"/iel5/94/5128488/05128529.pdf","startPage":"876","endPage":"881","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Dielectrics and Electrical Insulation","doi":"10.1109/TDEI.2009.5128529","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TDEI.2009.5128529","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5128488","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5128529","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Gamma-ray Irradiation Inhibiting Surface Charge Accumulation on Polyethylene","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Polyethylene","Surface charging","Surface discharges","Polymers","Dielectrics and electrical insulation","Radioactive materials","Chemicals","Plastic insulation","Aerospace electronics","Nuclear electronics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["chemical structure","cobalt","corona","gamma-rays","insulating materials","materials testing","polymers","surface charging"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["gamma-ray irradiation","surface charge accumulation","polymer insulating material","spacecraft","nuclear power station","electronic devices","electrical devices","energetic radioactive ray","electrostatic probe","surface charge density","radiation-induced degradation","cross-linking reaction","DC corona charging method","Co"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["polyethylene, gamma-ray irradiation, surface charge, localized surface states, cross-linking, degradation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5128529/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"Gamma-ray Irradiation Inhibiting Surface Charge Accumulation on Polyethylene","volume":"16","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/5128529/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10736288","dateOfInsertion":"30 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Gamma-ray Irradiation Inhibiting Surface Charge Accumulation on Polyethylene","sourcePdf":"p0876-du.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.055269S","chronDate":"June  2009","xplore-pub-id":"94","isNumber":"5128488","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"94","citationCount":"34","xplore-issue":"5128488","articleId":"5128529","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5128907,"authors":[{"name":"Haibo He","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Stevens Institute of Technology, Hoboken, NJ, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/69/5173046/5128907/5128907-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Haibo He received the BS and MS degrees in electrical engineering from Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST), Wuhan, China, in 1999 and 2002, respectively, and the PhD degree in electrical engineering from Ohio University, Athens, in 2006.

Although existing knowledge discovery and data engineering techniques have shown great success in many real-world applications, the problem of learning from imbalanced data (the imbalanced learning problem) is a relatively new challenge that has attracted growing attention from both academia and industry. The imbalanced learning problem is concerned with the performance of learning algorithms in the presence of underrepresented data and severe class distribution skews. Due to the inherent complex characteristics of imbalanced data sets, learning from such data requires new understandings, principles, algorithms, and tools to transform vast amounts of raw data efficiently into information and knowledge representation. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive review of the development of research in learning from imbalanced data. Our focus is to provide a critical review of the nature of the problem, the state-of-the-art technologies, and the current assessment metrics used to evaluate learning performance under the imbalanced learning scenario. Furthermore, in order to stimulate future research in this field, we also highlight the major opportunities and challenges, as well as potential important research directions for learning from imbalanced data.","doi":"10.1109/TKDE.2008.239","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5173046","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TKDE.2008.239","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/69/5173046/05128907.pdf","startPage":"1263","endPage":"1284","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Learning from Imbalanced Data","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"Learning from Imbalanced Data","volume":"21","issue":"9","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2009","dateOfInsertion":"24 July 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5128907/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10793203","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5128907/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Learning from Imbalanced Data","sourcePdf":"ttk2009091263.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.198158S","chronDate":"Sept.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"69","isNumber":"5173046","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"69","citationCount":"3415","xplore-issue":"5173046","articleId":"5128907","onlineDate":"26 June 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-27"},{"_id":5128909,"authors":[{"name":"Jan C. van Gemert","affiliation":["D\u00e9partement d'Informatique, Ecole Normale Sup\u00e9erieure, Paris, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/34/5466012/5128909/5128909-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jan C. van Gemert received the BSc degree from the Fontys in Eindhoven and the MSc and PhD degrees from the University of Amsterdam.

The codebook model describes an image as a bag of discrete visual words selected from a vocabulary, where the frequency distributions of visual words in an image allow classification. One inherent component of the codebook model is the assignment of discrete visual words to continuous image features. Despite the clear mismatch of this hard assignment with the nature of continuous features, the approach has been successfully applied for some years. In this paper, we investigate four types of soft assignment of visual words to image features. We demonstrate that explicitly modeling visual word assignment ambiguity improves classification performance compared to the hard assignment of the traditional codebook model. The traditional codebook model is compared against our method for five well-known data sets: 15 natural scenes, Caltech-101, Caltech-256, and Pascal VOC 2007/2008. We demonstrate that large codebook vocabulary sizes completely deteriorate the performance of the traditional model, whereas the proposed model performs consistently. Moreover, we show that our method profits in high-dimensional feature spaces and reaps higher benefits when increasing the number of image categories.","doi":"10.1109/TPAMI.2009.132","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel5/34/5466012/05128909.pdf","startPage":"1271","endPage":"1283","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.2009.132","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5466012","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Visual Word Ambiguity","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5128909","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 June 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5128909/","displayDocTitle":"Visual Word Ambiguity","volume":"32","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 2010","accessionNumber":"11340961","pubMedId":"20489229","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5128909/","dateOfInsertion":"18 May 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Visual Word Ambiguity","sourcePdf":"ttp2010071271.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.081067S","chronDate":"July  2010","xplore-pub-id":"34","isNumber":"5466012","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"536","xplore-issue":"5466012","articleId":"5128909","onlineDate":"26 June 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5128911,"authors":[{"name":"Tomas Werner","affiliation":["Department of Cybernetics, Czech Technical University, Praque, Czech Republic"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/34/5487331/5128911/5128911-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Tom\u00e1\u0161 Werner received the PhD degree in multiple view geometry in computer vision from the Czech Technical University in Prague in 1999.

We link this approach to many works from constraint programming, which relation has so far been ignored in machine vision and learning. While the approach has been mostly considered only for binary constraints, we generalize it to n-ary constraints in a simple and natural way. This includes a simple algorithm to minimize the LP-based upper bound, n-ary max-sum diffusion-however, we consider using other bound-optimizing algorithms as well. The diffusion iteration is tractable for a certain class of high-arity constraints represented as a black box, which is analogical to propagators for global constraints CSP. Diffusion exactly solves permuted n-ary supermodular problems. A hierarchy of gradually tighter LP relaxations is obtained simply by adding various zero constraints and coupling them in various ways to existing constraints. Zero constraints can be added incrementally, which leads to a cutting-plane algorithm. The separation problem is formulated as finding an unsatisfiable subproblem of a CSP.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel5/34/5487331/05128911.pdf","startPage":"1474","endPage":"1488","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","doi":"10.1109/TPAMI.2009.134","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.2009.134","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5487331","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5128911","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Revisiting the Linear Programming Relaxation Approach to Gibbs Energy Minimization and Weighted Constraint Satisfaction","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Linear programming","Machine vision","Machine learning","Upper bound","Graphical models","Markov random fields","Tree graphs","Constraint optimization","Artificial intelligence"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["constraint handling","free energy","linear programming","relaxation theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["linear programming relaxation approach","Gibbs energy minimization","weighted constraint satisfaction","constraint programming","machine vision","learning","bound optimizing algorithms","cutting plane algorithm","CSP"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Weighted constraint satisfaction","Gibbs distribution","graphical model","Markov random field","linear programming relaxation","marginal polytope","cut polytope","cutting-plane algorithm","global constraint","supermodularity","tree-reweighted max-product."]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5128911/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"Revisiting the Linear Programming Relaxation Approach to Gibbs Energy Minimization and Weighted Constraint Satisfaction","volume":"32","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/5128911/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2010","accessionNumber":"11373237","pubMedId":"20558878","dateOfInsertion":"17 June 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Revisiting the Linear Programming Relaxation Approach to Gibbs Energy Minimization and Weighted Constraint Satisfaction","sourcePdf":"ttp2010081474.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.119796S","chronDate":"Aug.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"34","isNumber":"5487331","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"5487331","articleId":"5128911","onlineDate":"26 June 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5129275,"authors":[{"name":"Thomas Hobiger","affiliation":["National Institute of Information and Communications Technology, Tokyo, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/36/5257398/5129275/5129275-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Thomas Hobiger received the M.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees in geodesy and geophysics from the Vienna University of Technology, Vienna, Austria, in 2002 and 2005, respectively.","He has been with the Kashima Space Research Center, National Institute of Information and Communications Technology, Tokyo, Japan, where he was a Japan Society for the Promotion of Science Fellow from October 2006 to September 2008 and where he has been an Expert Researcher since October 2008.

This ongoing activity has generated various geometric performance data over two and a half years of on-orbit operation. A suite of geometric model parameters was calibrated to express the geometric characteristics of the PRISM sensors. These include static interior parameters (charge-coupled device camera parameters) and dynamic exterior parameters (orbit data, attitude data, and sensor alignment). The interior parameters were calibrated using test-field self-calibration with test sites of dense ground control points (GCPs). The exterior parameters were calibrated by adaptive orientation with test sites of worldwide GCPs. These parameters are correlated to the direct geolocation accuracy of the PRISM sensors and are monitored and validated to maintain performance. The performance of the digital surface model (DSM) derived from these geometric model parameters was analyzed. The detailed characteristics of the triangulation results were analyzed by GCPs, and the height accuracy was evaluated based on comparisons with high-accuracy high-resolution reference DSM data sets derived from Lidar and aerial photo matching of various terrain features.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel5/36/5332062/05129607.pdf","startPage":"4060","endPage":"4073","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2009.2021649","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2009.2021649","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5332062","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5129607","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"PRISM On-Orbit Geometric Calibration and DSM Performance","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Calibration","Solid modeling","Sensor phenomena and characterization","Automatic testing","Remote sensing","Instruments","Satellites","Earth","Cameras","Aerodynamics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["calibration","terrain mapping","topography (Earth)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Panchromatic Remote-sensing Instrument for Stereo Mapping","PRISM on-orbit geometric calibration","Advanced Land-Observing Satellite","topographic data","high-resolution observation","stereoscopic observation","Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency's","Earth Observation Research Center","geometric model parameters","static interior parameters","test-field self-calibration","dense ground control points","dynamic exterior parameters","adaptive orientation","worldwide GCPs","digital surface model","DSM","Lidar","aerial photo matching","terrain features"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Digital surface model (DSM)","geometric calibration","image orientation","Panchromatic Remote-sensing Instrument for Stereo Mapping (PRISM)","stereoscopy","triangulation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5129607/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"PRISM On-Orbit Geometric Calibration and DSM Performance","volume":"47","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/5129607/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"10979207","dateOfInsertion":"17 November 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"PRISM On-Orbit Geometric Calibration and DSM Performance","sourcePdf":"tgrs-takaku-2021649.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.121379S","chronDate":"Dec.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"5332062","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"84","xplore-issue":"5332062","articleId":"5129607","onlineDate":"26 June 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5129789,"authors":[{"name":"Younghak Cho","affiliation":["School of Mechanical Design and Automation Engineering, Seoul National University of Technology, Seoul, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/84/5185350/5129789/5129789-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Younghak Cho received the M.Eng. degree from the Department of Mechanical Design and Production Engineering, Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea, in 2001, and the Ph.D. degree in precision machinery engineering from The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan, in 2005.","From April 2005 to August 2007, he was with the Institute of Industrial Science, The University of Tokyo, as a JSPS Postdoctoral Researcher.

This muEIS system was used to obtain the electrical impedance spectra of the poorly metastatic HNC cell line 686 LN and the highly metastatic HNC cell line 686 LN-M4e over a frequency range of 40 Hz - 10 MHz. The 686 LN cells had higher impedance phase compared to that of 686 LN-M4e cells at frequencies between 50 kHz and 2 MHz.

The results of this paper demonstrate that the present and projected electricity grid in Ontario can be optimally exploited for charging almost 6% of the total vehicles in Ontario or 12.5% of the vehicles in Toronto's transport sector by 2025; this corresponds to approximately 500 000 PHEVs that can be charged from the grid without any additional transmission or power-generation investments beyond those currently planned.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5129873/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"57","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"12 January 2010","accessionNumber":"11054645","htmlLink":"/document/5129873/","displayDocTitle":"Optimal Transition to Plug-In Hybrid Electric Vehicles in Ontario, Canada, Considering the Electricity-Grid Limitations","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal Transition to Plug-In Hybrid Electric Vehicles in Ontario, Canada, Considering the Electricity-Grid Limitations","sourcePdf":"tie-canizares-2025711.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.114691S","chronDate":"Feb.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"5379132","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"222","xplore-issue":"5379132","articleId":"5129873","onlineDate":"26 June 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-08"},{"_id":5129956,"authors":[{"name":"Xiangyun Zhou","affiliation":["College of Engineering and Computer Science, Australian National University, Canberra, ACT, Australia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/5307285/5129956/5129956-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Xiangyun Zhou (S'08) received the B.E.(Hons.) degree in electronics and telecommunications engineering in 2007 from The Australian National University, Canberra, ACT, Australia, where he is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree in engineering and information technology with the Research School of Information Sciences and Engineering, College of Engineering and Computer Science.","His research interests are in signal processing for wireless communications, including multiple-input\u2013multiple-output systems, ad hoc networks, and relay and cooperative networks."]},"firstName":"Xiangyun","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37406420900"},{"name":"Salman Durrani","affiliation":["College of Engineering and Computer Science, Australian National University, Canberra, ACT, Australia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/5307285/5129956/5129956-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Salman Durrani (S'00\u2013M'05) received the B.Sc.

We consider two simple beamforming schemes: random beamforming, where each node selects a main beam direction randomly with no coordination with other nodes, and center-directed beamforming, where each node points its main beam toward the geographical center of the network. Taking path loss, shadowing, and beamforming into account, we derive an expression for the effective coverage area of a node, which is used to analyze both the local network connectivity (probability of node isolation) and the overall network connectivity (1-connectivity and path probability). We verify the correctness of our analytical approach by comparing with simulations. Our results show that the presence of shadowing increases the probability of node isolation and reduces the 1-connectivity of the network, although moderate shadowing can improve the path probability between two nodes. Furthermore, we show that the impact of beamforming strongly depends on the level of the channel path loss. In particular, compared with omnidirectional antennas, beamforming improves both the local and the overall connectivity for a path loss exponent of alpha < 3. The analysis in this paper provides an efficient way for system designers to characterize and optimize the connectivity of wireless ad hoc networks with beamforming.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5129956/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"58","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"10 November 2009","accessionNumber":"10966655","htmlLink":"/document/5129956/","displayDocTitle":"Connectivity Analysis of Wireless Ad Hoc Networks With Beamforming","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Connectivity Analysis of Wireless Ad Hoc Networks With Beamforming","sourcePdf":"tvt-zhou-2026049.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.091592S","chronDate":"Nov.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"5307285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"5307285","articleId":"5129956","onlineDate":"26 June 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5129960,"authors":[{"name":"Abduladhim Ashtaiwi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Queen's University, Kingston, ONT, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/5431116/5129960/5129960-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Abduladhim Ashtaiwi (A'09) received the B.Sc. degree in electrical and electronic engineering from Bright Star University of Technology, Brega Hereby, Libya, in 1992 and the M.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees from Queen's University, Kingston, ON, Canada, in 2004 and 2009, respectively.","He is currently a Research Associate with the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Queen's University.

The medium access collision avoidance of IEEE 802.11e, even with IEEE 802.11n at the physical layer, still utilizes the enhanced distributed coordination function (EDCF) mechanism. It is known that collisions cause significant performance degradation in IEEE 802.11e EDCF-based systems. In this paper, we utilize the multiple spatial channels of MIMO technology to propose collision-mitigation enhancements to the IEEE 802.11e EDCF. The key idea of the scheme, which is called MIMO-based EDCF (M-EDCF), is the sharing of the spatial channels during the medium contention period, i.e., instead of accessing the medium using all the spatial channels, the accessing nodes use a subset of the available spatial channels. As the number of concurrent spatial channels used is less than or equal to the spatial degree of freedom, receivers can decode the transmitted signals of different medium access contenders and then coordinate their responses to avoid potential collisions. The spatial channel sharing also enables transmitters to sense the medium and terminate if they detect other ongoing medium access attempts. Simulation results show that the M-EDCF scheme substantially reduces medium access collisions. Based on the preliminary results, an adaptive optimized length of the collision-avoidance window is derived. The performance of the M-EDCF scheme based on optimized online spatial channel sharing demonstrates that the scheme further reduces medium access collisions and boosts medium utilization.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MIMO-Based Collision Avoidance in IEEE 802.11e Networks","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2009.2026177","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/5431116/05129960.pdf","startPage":"1076","endPage":"1086","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2009.2026177","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5431116","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5129960","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5129960/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 June 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2010","displayDocTitle":"MIMO-Based Collision Avoidance in IEEE 802.11e Networks","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"59","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/5129960/","dateOfInsertion":"15 March 2010","publicationDate":"March 2010","accessionNumber":"11177563","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MIMO-Based Collision Avoidance in IEEE 802.11e Networks","sourcePdf":"tvt-hassanein-2026177.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.086857S","chronDate":"March  2010","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"5431116","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"5431116","articleId":"5129960","onlineDate":"26 June 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"}]
