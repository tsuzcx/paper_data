The new semi-passive component, referred to as sensatag (sense-a-tag), has a dual functionality: it can sense and decode communication between the reader and standard tags in its proximity, and can communicate with the reader like standard tags using backscatter modulation. Based on the information conveyed by the sensatags to the reader, localization algorithms based on binary sensor principles can be developed. We conduct a number of experiments in a laboratory to quantify the performance of our system, including two real applications, one finding the exact placement of items on shelves, and the other estimating the direction of item movement.","doi":"10.1109/JSEN.2012.2220344","startPage":"528","endPage":"537","publicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSEN.2012.2220344","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6409978","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","pdfPath":"/iel5/7361/6409978/06310003.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Novel Semi-Passive RFID System for Indoor Localization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6310003/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Novel Semi-Passive RFID System for Indoor Localization","volume":"13","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/6310003/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"13219982","publicationDate":"Feb. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"11 January 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 September 2012","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Novel Semi-Passive RFID System for Indoor Localization","sourcePdf":"jsen-savic-2220344-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.064922S","chronDate":"Feb.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"7361","isNumber":"6409978","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7361","citationCount":"57","xplore-issue":"6409978","articleId":"6310003","onlineDate":"21 September 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6310009,"authors":[{"name":"Simon Akhtari","affiliation":["TU Dortmund, Chair for High Frequency Technology, Dortmund, Germany"],"firstName":"Simon","lastName":"Akhtari","id":"38515777700"},{"name":"Peter M.

By updating and communicating sensor and actuator data only when needed for stability or performance purposes, ETC is capable of reducing the amount of communications, while still retaining a satisfactory closed-loop performance. In this paper, an ETC strategy is proposed by striking a balance between conventional periodic sampled-data control and ETC, leading to so-called periodic event-triggered control (PETC). In PETC, the event-triggering condition is verified periodically and at every sampling time it is decided whether or not to compute and to transmit new measurements and new control signals. The periodic character of the triggering conditions leads to various implementation benefits, including a minimum inter-event time of (at least) the sampling interval of the event-triggering condition.

However, these images can be enhanced by exploiting scene sparseness (leading to sharper images) or homogeneity (leading to more natural, i.e., visually intuitive, images). To realize these enhancements, we employ a constrained non-linear optimization algorithm based on the Lagrange multiplier method. This approach has an advantage over related image optimization algorithms in that the Lagrange multipliers are solved within the algorithm rather than being selected a priori. This yields a system of equations that is solved iteratively rather than by gradient search. Data from a portable wideband UHF radar is used to test algorithm performance for several through-wall (cinder block) and free-space scenarios.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fast Optimization of Through-Wall Radar Images Via the Method of Lagrange Multipliers","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2012.2220321","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8/6397624/06310016.pdf","startPage":"320","endPage":"328","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2012.2220321","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6397624","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6310016","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6310016/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 September 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2013","displayDocTitle":"Fast Optimization of Through-Wall Radar Images Via the Method of Lagrange Multipliers","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"61","issue":"1","dateOfInsertion":"28 December 2012","publicationDate":"Jan. 2013","accessionNumber":"13191187","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast Optimization of Through-Wall Radar Images Via the Method of Lagrange Multipliers","sourcePdf":"tap-burkholder-2220321-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.061788S","chronDate":"Jan.  2013","isNumber":"6397624","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"16","articleId":"6310016","onlineDate":"21 September 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6310018,"authors":[{"name":"Catarina C.

A hybrid passive UHF/UWB RFID concept has been recently proposed that conciliates the potential from high resolution UWB impulse radio with the typical range from UHF-RFID identification systems. This paper proposes a new planar antenna for hybrid passive tag systems, which operates both in the UHF-RFID band and in the FCC UWB band. The co-designed UHF and UWB antenna elements are printed back-to-back on each side of a common substrate with appropriate topology for future integration with a single UHF-UWB RFID chip. Experimental tests have shown that both UHF-RFID and UWB performance of the hybrid antenna are comparable to available commercial solutions that work just on a single band. The antenna is adequate for low-cost mass production of hybrid passive tags. It aims at low-cost passive RFID systems combining the ability of item identification with precise tracking in indoor environments.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8/6397624/06310018.pdf","startPage":"354","endPage":"361","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2012.2220112","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2012.2220112","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6397624","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hybrid UHF/UWB Antenna for Passive Indoor Identification and Localization Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6310018/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 September 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2013","displayDocTitle":"Hybrid UHF/UWB Antenna for Passive Indoor Identification and Localization Systems","htmlLink":"/document/6310018/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"28 December 2012","accessionNumber":"13191189","isJournal":true,"volume":"61","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hybrid UHF/UWB Antenna for Passive Indoor Identification and Localization Systems","sourcePdf":"tap-costa-2220112-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.066158S","chronDate":"Jan.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"6397624","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"55","xplore-issue":"6397624","articleId":"6310018","onlineDate":"21 September 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6310022,"authors":[{"name":"Qingxin Guo","affiliation":["School of Information Engineering, Communication University of China, Beijng, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8/6423915/6310022/6310022-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Qingxin Guo (M'12\u2013SM'12) was born in China in 1974.

He coined the descriptors \u201cfinite difference time domain\u201d and \u201cFDTD\u201d in a 1980 IEEE paper, and in 1990 was the first person to be named an IEEE Fellow in the FDTD technical area. In 2002, he was named by the Institute of Scientific Information (ISI) to its original listing of the most-cited researchers worldwide, as published in ISIHighlyCited.com. According to Google Scholar, to-date his publications have received more than 20,000 citations, and the exact phrase \u201cfinite difference time domain\u201d has appeared in over 48,000 articles. According to Microsoft Academic Search, the total citations of the first and second editions of his book, Computational Electrodynamics: The Finite Difference Time- Domain Method, rank 10th on its all-time list of the most-cited publications in all branches of engineering (of more than 3.3 million), and 5th all-time when considering primarily electrical engineering publications. In May 2010, Nature Milestones: Photons recognized him as one of the two principal pioneers of numerical methods for solving Maxwell's equations. Currently, continuing a collaboration that began in 2003, he is working with Prof. Vadim Backman of Northwestern's Biomedical Engineering Department. This research is aimed at the minimally invasive detection of early-stage cancers of the colon, pancreas, and lung. The techniques being pursued are based upon spectral and/or angular analysis of light that is backscattered from histologically normal tissue located away from a neoplastic lesion in what has been termed the field effect.

Motivated by the fact that kernel trick can capture the nonlinear similarity of features, which helps in finding a sparse representation of nonlinear features, we propose kernel sparse representation (KSR). Essentially, KSR is a sparse coding technique in a high dimensional feature space mapped by an implicit mapping function. We apply KSR to feature coding in image classification, face recognition, and kernel matrix approximation. More specifically, by incorporating KSR into spatial pyramid matching (SPM), we develop KSRSPM, which achieves a good performance for image classification. Moreover, KSR-based feature coding can be shown as a generalization of efficient match kernel and an extension of Sc-based SPM. We further show that our proposed KSR using a histogram intersection kernel (HIK) can be considered a soft assignment extension of HIK-based feature quantization in the feature coding process. Besides feature coding, comparing with sparse coding, KSR can learn more discriminative sparse codes and achieve higher accuracy for face recognition. Moreover, KSR can also be applied to kernel matrix approximation in large scale learning tasks, and it demonstrates its robustness to kernel matrix approximation, especially when a small fraction of the data is used. Extensive experimental results demonstrate promising results of KSR in image classification, face recognition, and kernel matrix approximation. All these applications prove the effectiveness of KSR in computer vision and machine learning tasks.","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2012.2215620","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/83/6407512/06310056.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2012.2215620","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6407512","startPage":"423","endPage":"434","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sparse Representation With Kernels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6310056","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Sparse Representation With Kernels","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6310056/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 September 2012","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"22","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 2013","accessionNumber":"13219170","pubMedId":"23014744","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6310056/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sparse Representation With Kernels","sourcePdf":"tip-gao-2215620-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.110018S","chronDate":"Feb.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"6407512","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"136","xplore-issue":"6407512","articleId":"6310056","onlineDate":"21 September 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6310057,"authors":[{"name":"Jinn Ho","affiliation":["Institute of Information Science, Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/83/6449327/6310057/6310057-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jinn Ho received the M.S. degree in mathematics from National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan, in 1997.","He is currently a Research Assistant with the Institute of Information Science, Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan.

Specifically, by monitoring errors converged in the ER algorithm, known patches whose Fourier transform magnitudes are similar to that of the target patch are selected from the target image. In the second approach, the Fourier transform magnitude of the target patch is estimated from those of the selected known patches and their corresponding errors.

Different from models used in most surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithms, surrogates in IGA must be able to handle the inherent uncertainties in fitness assignment by human users, where, e.g., interval-based fitness values are assigned to individuals. This poses another challenge to using surrogates for fitness approximation in evolutionary optimization, in addition to the lack of training data. In this paper, a new surrogate-assisted IGA has been proposed, where the uncertainty in subjective fitness evaluations is exploited both in training the surrogates and in managing surrogates. To enhance the approximation accuracy of the surrogates, an improved cotraining algorithm for semisupervised learning has been suggested, where the uncertainty in interval-based fitness values is taken into account in training and weighting the two cotrained models. Moreover, uncertainty in the interval-based fitness values is also considered in model management so that not only the best individuals but also the most uncertain individuals will be chosen to be re-evaluated by the human user. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is verified on two test problems as well as in fashion design, a typical application of IGA. Our results indicate that the new surrogate-assisted IGA can effectively alleviate user fatigue and is more likely to find acceptable solutions in solving complex design problems.","doi":"10.1109/TSMCB.2012.2214382","startPage":"685","endPage":"698","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSMCB.2012.2214382","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6479286","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/6221036/6479286/06310069.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A New Surrogate-Assisted Interactive Genetic Algorithm With Weighted Semisupervised Learning","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6310069/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A New Surrogate-Assisted Interactive Genetic Algorithm With Weighted Semisupervised Learning","volume":"43","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/6310069/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"13383970","pubMedId":"23014759","publicationDate":"April 2013","dateOfInsertion":"13 March 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 March 2013","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A New Surrogate-Assisted Interactive Genetic Algorithm With Weighted Semisupervised Learning","sourcePdf":"tsmcb-chen-2214382-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.190105S","chronDate":"April  2013","xplore-pub-id":"6221036","isNumber":"6479286","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6221036","citationCount":"54","xplore-issue":"6479286","articleId":"6310069","onlineDate":"07 March 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":6310074,"authors":[{"name":"Yann Barbotin","affiliation":["Faculty of Informatics and Communications, \u00e9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5503868/6374660/6310074/6310074-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yann Barbotin (S'05) was born in Ambilly, France, in 1985.

This scenario fits most of the modern outdoor communication protocols for mobile access (ETSI Std. 125 913) or digital broadcasting (ETSI Std. 300 744) among others. Such channels verify a sparse common support (SCS) property which was used in the work of Barbotin et al. (2012) to propose a finite rate of innovation (FRI)-based sampling and estimation algorithm. In this paper, we improve the robustness and computational complexity aspects of this algorithm. The method is based on projection in Krylov subspaces to improve complexity and a new criterion called the partial effective rank (PER) to estimate the level of sparsity to gain robustness.

The sparsity is estimated online based on the PER, and the algorithm therefore has a sense of introspection being able to relinquish sparsity if it is lacking. The estimation performances are tested on field measurements with synthetic additive white Gaussian noise, and the proposed algorithm outperforms nonsparse reconstruction in the medium to low signal-to-noise ratio range (\u2264 0 dB), increasing the rate of successful symbol decoding by 1/10 in average, and 1/3 in the best case. The experiments also show that the algorithm does not perform worse than a nonsparse estimation algorithm in nonsparse operating conditions, since it may fall-back to it if the PER criterion does not detect a sufficient level of sparsity. The algorithm is also tested against a method assuming a \u201cdiscrete\u201d sparsity model as in compressed sensing. The conducted test indicates a trade-off between speed and accuracy.","doi":"10.1109/JETCAS.2012.2214872","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Emerging and Selected Topics in Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5503868/6374660/06310074.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6374660","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JETCAS.2012.2214872","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Emerging and Selected Topics in Circuits and Systems","startPage":"402","endPage":"412","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fast and Robust Parametric Estimation of Jointly Sparse Channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6310074","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 September 2012","displayDocTitle":"Fast and Robust Parametric Estimation of Jointly Sparse Channels","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6310074/","volume":"2","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/6310074/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2012","accessionNumber":"13167799","dateOfInsertion":"27 December 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast and Robust Parametric Estimation of Jointly Sparse Channels","sourcePdf":"jetcas-barbotin-2214872-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.087053S","chronDate":"Sept.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"5503868","isNumber":"6374660","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5503868","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"6374660","articleId":"6310074","onlineDate":"21 September 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6310076,"authors":[{"name":"Leonid Belostotski","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada"],"firstName":"Leonid","lastName":"Belostotski","id":"37294257600"},{"name":"Arjuna Madanayake","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Akron, Akron, OH, USA"],"firstName":"Arjuna","lastName":"Madanayake","id":"37270779600"},{"name":"Leonard T.

Moreover, there is no need for a nonsymmetrical calibration standard that is strictly required in a more conventional five-standard calibration. Commercially available standard substrates can thus be used. Detailed theory of the reciprocal 16-term error model and a new calibration method are presented. Reciprocity assumption is valid in on-wafer and other measurements when two-tier calibration is applied. However, the calibration scheme allows measurement of nonreciprocal devices too. The usefulness of the new method is confirmed by practical wideband on-wafer measurements.","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.2012.2217150","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.2012.2217150","startPage":"3551","endPage":"3558","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel5/22/6341879/06310085.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6341879","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"16-Term Error Model in Reciprocal Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6310085/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 September 2012","displayDocTitle":"16-Term Error Model in Reciprocal Systems","volume":"60","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2012","accessionNumber":"13100846","publicationDate":"Nov. 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6310085/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"16-Term Error Model in Reciprocal Systems","sourcePdf":"tmtt-silvonen-2217150-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.184361S","chronDate":"Nov.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"6341879","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6341879","articleId":"6310085","onlineDate":"21 September 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6310138,"authors":[{"name":"Theodore W.

Reaching this goal involves understanding something fundamental about the brain that has not been understood previously: how the brain internally codes memories. In developing a hippocampal prosthesis for the rat, we have been able to demonstrate a multiple-input, multiple-output (MIMO) nonlinear model that predicts in real time the spatiotemporal codes for specific memories required for correct performance on a standard learning/memory task, i.e., delayed-nonmatch-to-sample (DNMS) memory. The MIMO model has been tested successfully in a number of contexts; most notably, in animals with a pharmacologically disabled hippocampus, we were able to reinstate long-term memories necessary for correct DNMS behavior by substituting a MIMO model-predicted code, delivered by electrical stimulation to the hippocampus through an array of electrodes, resulting in spatiotemporal hippocampal activity that is normally generated endogenously. We also have shown that delivering the same model-predicted code to electrode-implanted control animals with a normally functioning hippocampus substantially enhances animals memory capacity above control levels. These results in rodents have formed the basis for extending the MIMO model to nonhuman primates; this is now underway as the last step of the REMIND program before developing a MIMO-based cognitive prosthesis for humans.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6310124","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MPUL.2012.2205775","publicationTitle":"IEEE Pulse","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Pulse","pdfPath":"/iel5/5454060/6310124/06310138.pdf","startPage":"17","endPage":"22","doi":"10.1109/MPUL.2012.2205775","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Role of the Hippocampus in Memory Formation : Restorative Encoding Memory Integration Neural Device As a Cognitive Neural Prosthesis","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2012","displayDocTitle":"Role of the Hippocampus in Memory Formation : Restorative Encoding Memory Integration Neural Device As a Cognitive Neural Prosthesis","volume":"3","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/6310138/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2012","accessionNumber":"12999252","dateOfInsertion":"21 September 2012","pubMedId":"23014702","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6310138/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 September 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Role of the Hippocampus in Memory Formation : Restorative Encoding Memory Integration Neural Device As a Cognitive Neural Prosthesis","sourcePdf":"03mpul05-berger-2205775-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.123016S","chronDate":"Sept.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"5454060","isNumber":"6310124","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5454060","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"6310124","articleId":"6310138","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6310164,"authors":[{"name":"Shafi Bashar","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Univ. of California, Davis, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/6389884/6310164/6310164-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Shafi Bashar (S'07-M'12) received his B.S. degree in Electrical and Electronic Engineering from Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology, in 2005, M.S. degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering from University of California, Davis in 2008 and Ph.D. degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering from University of California, Davis in 2011.

Most existing works have characterized maximum achievable secrecy rate or secrecy capacity for single and multiple antenna systems based on Gaussian source signals and secrecy code. For practical considerations, we study the effect of finite discrete-constellation on the achievable secrecy rate of multiple-antenna wire-tap channels. Our proposed precoding scheme converts the underlying multi-antenna system into a bank of parallel channels. Based on this precoding strategy, we develop a decentralized power allocation algorithm based on dual decomposition to maximize the achievable secrecy rate. In addition, we analyze the achievable secrecy rate for finite-alphabet inputs in low and high SNR regions. Our results demonstrate substantial difference in secrecy rate between systems given finite-alphabet inputs and systems with Gaussian inputs.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2012.091212.110199","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/6389884/06310164.pdf","startPage":"3816","endPage":"3825","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2012.091212.110199","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6389884","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On Secrecy Rate Analysis of MIMO Wiretap Channels Driven by Finite-Alphabet Input","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6310164","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 September 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"December  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6310164/","displayDocTitle":"On Secrecy Rate Analysis of MIMO Wiretap Channels Driven by Finite-Alphabet Input","volume":"60","issue":"12","publicationDate":"December 2012","accessionNumber":"13188486","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6310164/","dateOfInsertion":"21 December 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On Secrecy Rate Analysis of MIMO Wiretap Channels Driven by Finite-Alphabet Input","sourcePdf":"3816-tc1212-bashar.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.083246S","chronDate":"December  2012","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"6389884","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"48","xplore-issue":"6389884","articleId":"6310164","onlineDate":"21 September 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":6310166,"authors":[{"name":"Vasileios K.

In addition, in the context of green communications the use of cooperative diversity techniques can be considered as an important tool which improves the performance, reliability and efficiency of such systems. In this paper, the outage performance analysis of a cooperative system operating at frequencies above 10 GHz is presented, where the propagation medium consists of spatially correlated fading channels. In addition, the energy and spectral efficiency of various multiple-access protocols as well as different relay retransmission and receiver combining techniques are investigated. Moreover, it is proposed that the high correlation coefficient between various rain fading channels can be exploited by the relay to estimate the rain fading of the next hop. Extended numerical results present the impact of various system parameters on the end-to-end performance. Finally, comparison with an energy- and bandwidth- equivalent direct link highlights the system parameter regions where cooperative diversity offers gains over non-cooperation.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2012.091112.110388","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6389884","startPage":"3641","endPage":"3649","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/6389884/06310166.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2012.091112.110388","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cooperative Diversity Performance in Millimeter Wave Radio Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Diversity reception","Protocols","Rain attenuation","Correlation","Fading"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel capacity","cooperative communication","diversity reception","fading channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["millimeter wave radio systems","communication systems","wireless backhaul","fading mechanism","green communications","cooperative diversity techniques","cooperative system","fading channels","multiple-access protocols","relay retransmission techniques","receiver combining techniques","frequency 10 GHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cooperative diversity","end-to-end performance","outage probability","correlated lognormal fading channels","rain attenuation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"December  2012","displayDocTitle":"Cooperative Diversity Performance in Millimeter Wave Radio Systems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6310166/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 September 2012","dateOfInsertion":"21 December 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"60","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/6310166/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"13188488","publicationDate":"December 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cooperative Diversity Performance in Millimeter Wave Radio Systems","sourcePdf":"3641-tc1212-sakar.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.086805S","chronDate":"December  2012","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"6389884","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"6389884","articleId":"6310166","onlineDate":"21 September 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6310167,"authors":[{"name":"Jun Yao","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/6389884/6310167/6310167-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jun Yao was born in Dalian, Liaoning province, China.

A reduced-state form of the channel detector is also proposed to further reduce the system complexity. To achieve better performance, iterations are introduced between the two constituent channel detectors and among the two constituent detectors with the LDPC decoder. The computational complexity and performance of different iteration schemes are analyzed. Simulation results show that the proposed detection scheme can mitigate the 2D interference effectively and the LDPC codes can be well integrated to the 2D iterative detector to further improve the system performance significantly.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2012.091112.110433","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2012.091112.110433","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/6389884/06310167.pdf","startPage":"3548","endPage":"3555","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6389884","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint Iterative Detection/Decoding Scheme for Discrete Two-Dimensional Interference Channels","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6310167/","chronOrPublicationDate":"December  2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 September 2012","displayDocTitle":"Joint Iterative Detection/Decoding Scheme for Discrete Two-Dimensional Interference Channels","volume":"60","issue":"12","dateOfInsertion":"21 December 2012","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"December 2012","accessionNumber":"13188489","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6310167/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint Iterative Detection/Decoding Scheme for Discrete Two-Dimensional Interference Channels","sourcePdf":"3548-tc1212-yao.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.066141S","chronDate":"December  2012","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"6389884","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"6389884","articleId":"6310167","onlineDate":"21 September 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6310168,"authors":[{"name":"Yann Barbotin","affiliation":["Ecole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/6389884/6310168/6310168-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yann Barbotin was born in Ambilly, France, in 1985.

In small to medium bandwidth communications, as in the current standards for OFDM and CDMA communication systems (with bandwidth up to 20 MHz), such channels are individually sparse and at the same time share a common support set. Since the underlying physical channels are inherently continuous-time, we propose a parametric sparse estimation technique based on finite rate of innovation (FRI) principles. Parametric estimation is especially relevant to MIMO communications as it allows for a robust estimation and concise description of the channels. The core of the algorithm is a generalization of conventional spectral estimation methods to multiple input signals with common support. We show the application of our technique for channel estimation in OFDM (uniformly/contiguous DFT pilots) and CDMA downlink (Walsh-Hadamard coded schemes). In the presence of additive white Gaussian noise, theoretical lower bounds on the estimation of sparse common support (SCS) channel parameters in Rayleigh fading conditions are derived. Finally, an analytical spatial channel model is derived, and simulations on this model in the OFDM setting show the symbol error rate (SER) is reduced by a factor 2 (0 dB of SNR) to 5 (high SNR) compared to standard non-parametric methods - e.g. lowpass interpolation.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2012.091112.110439","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/6389884/06310168.pdf","startPage":"3705","endPage":"3716","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2012.091112.110439","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6389884","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Estimation of Sparse MIMO Channels with Common Support","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 September 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6310168/","chronOrPublicationDate":"December  2012","displayDocTitle":"Estimation of Sparse MIMO Channels with Common Support","dateOfInsertion":"21 December 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6310168/","accessionNumber":"13188490","volume":"60","issue":"12","publicationDate":"December 2012","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Estimation of Sparse MIMO Channels with Common Support","sourcePdf":"3705-tc1212-barbotin.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.118425S","chronDate":"December  2012","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"6389884","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"133","xplore-issue":"6389884","articleId":"6310168","onlineDate":"21 September 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6310171,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The design focuses on a parameter of the LT decoding process called the ripple size. This parameter was also a key element in the design proposed in the original work by Luby. Specifically, Luby argued that an LT code should provide a constant ripple size during decoding. In this work we show that the ripple size should decrease during decoding, in order to reduce the necessary overhead. Initially we motivate this claim by analytical results related to the redundancy within an LT code. We then propose a new design procedure, which can provide any desired achievable decreasing ripple size. The new design procedure is evaluated and compared to the current state of the art through simulations. This reveals a significant increase in performance with respect to both average overhead and error probability at any fixed overhead.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2012.091112.110864","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2012.091112.110864","startPage":"3191","endPage":"3197","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/6362326/06310172.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6362326","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design and Analysis of LT Codes with Decreasing Ripple Size","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6310172/","chronOrPublicationDate":"November  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 September 2012","displayDocTitle":"Design and Analysis of LT Codes with Decreasing Ripple Size","volume":"60","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"29 November 2012","accessionNumber":"13148536","publicationDate":"November 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6310172/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design and Analysis of LT Codes with Decreasing Ripple Size","sourcePdf":"3191-tc1211-soren.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.066535S","chronDate":"November  2012","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"6362326","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"43","xplore-issue":"6362326","articleId":"6310172","onlineDate":"21 September 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6310173,"authors":[{"name":"Mostafa Khoshnevisan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Notre Dame, Notre Dame, IN, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/6389884/6310173/6310173-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["J.

We characterize the optimal power allocation subject to both long-term and short-term power constraints, which depends upon the ratio of the two power levels. Additionally, we find a suboptimal power allocation if the input power is subject to long-term and per-antenna power constraints. We characterize the conditions for which one power constraint dominates and the other can be ignored. Numerical results suggest that, for the Rayleigh fading case, a short-term power constraint that is larger than a long-term power constraint does not significantly impact the ergodic capacity of the channel. The effect of per-antenna power constraints is also explored for the case of Rayleigh fading through our numerical results.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2012.091112.120071","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/6389884/06310173.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2012.091112.120071","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6389884","startPage":"3855","endPage":"3864","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Power Allocation in Multi-Antenna Wireless Systems Subject to Simultaneous Power Constraints","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6310173","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Power Allocation in Multi-Antenna Wireless Systems Subject to Simultaneous Power Constraints","chronOrPublicationDate":"December  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6310173/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 September 2012","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"60","issue":"12","publicationDate":"December 2012","accessionNumber":"13188493","dateOfInsertion":"21 December 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6310173/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power Allocation in Multi-Antenna Wireless Systems Subject to Simultaneous Power Constraints","sourcePdf":"3855-tc1212-khosh.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.068546S","chronDate":"December  2012","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"6389884","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"6389884","articleId":"6310173","onlineDate":"21 September 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":6310174,"authors":[{"name":"Xi Liu","affiliation":["ECE Department, Polytechnic Institute of New York University, Brooklyn, NY, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/6389884/6310174/6310174-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Xi Liu received the B .E. degree in electronic engineering and information science from the University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, in 2006 and the M.A.Sc. degree in electrical and computer engineering from the University of Toronto, ON, Canada, in 2008.

While most theoretical studies only account for the energy requirements of communication, the sensing process, which includes measurements and compression, can also consume comparable energy. In this paper, the problem of sensing and communicating parallel sources is studied by accounting for the cost of both communication and sensing. In the first formulation of the problem, the sensor has a separate energy budget for sensing and a rate budget for communication, while, in the second, it has a single energy budget for both tasks. Furthermore, in the second problem, each source has its own associated channel. Assuming that sources with larger variances have lower sensing costs, the optimal allocation of sensing energy and rate that minimizes the overall distortion is derived for the first problem. Moreover, structural results on the solution of the second problem are derived under the assumption that the sources with larger variances are transmitted on channels with lower noise. Closed-form solutions are also obtained for the case where the energy budget is sufficiently large. For an arbitrary order on the variances and costs, the optimal solution to the first problem is also obtained numerically and compared with several suboptimal strategies.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2012.091312.120130","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/6389884/06310174.pdf","startPage":"3826","endPage":"3835","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2012.091312.120130","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6389884","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy-Efficient Sensing and Communication of Parallel Gaussian Sources","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6310174/","chronOrPublicationDate":"December  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 September 2012","displayDocTitle":"Energy-Efficient Sensing and Communication of Parallel Gaussian Sources","volume":"60","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"21 December 2012","accessionNumber":"13188494","publicationDate":"December 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6310174/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy-Efficient Sensing and Communication of Parallel Gaussian Sources","sourcePdf":"3826-tc1212-liu.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.063888S","chronDate":"December  2012","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"6389884","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"6389884","articleId":"6310174","onlineDate":"21 September 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6310175,"authors":[{"name":"Wang Jun","affiliation":["Fujian Integrated Circuit Design Center"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/6389884/6310175/6310175-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Wang Jun received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in Communication and Information System from HoHai University, Nanjing, China, in 2003 and 2006, respectively; and the Ph.D. degree in Communication and Information System from Southeast University, Nanjing, China, in 2012.

However, its performance deteriorates rapidly if the noise power is not known exactly. Moreover, due to the presence of a colored channel interferer or some other reasons, the conventional white Gaussian noise may become colored. In order to solve these problems, this paper proposes several multicumulant based spectrum sensing methods: generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT) based multicumulant (GLRTMC) based detection method and multiantenna-assisted multicumulant (MAMC) based detection method. GLRTMC detection method is derived from generalized likelihood ratio test and assumed to be near optimum in theory. MAMC detection method, on the other hand, by using multiple antennas, is a complexity-reduced detector and allows us to make a compromise between performance and complexity. It is well known that cumulants higher than second order are zero for Gaussian distributions. Thus, GLRTMC detection method and MAMC detection method can extract a non-Gaussian signal from Gaussian noise even when the noise is colored. In addition, the proposed methods are nonparametric in the sense that they do not require any exact prior knowledge about the signal or the noise, such as noise power or cyclic frequencies. Hence they are immune from noise uncertainty. Simulation experiments are provided to show the validity and the superiority over single-cumulant based detector of the proposed multicumulant based detectors.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6310175/","chronOrPublicationDate":"December  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 September 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"60","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"December 2012","dateOfInsertion":"21 December 2012","accessionNumber":"13188495","htmlLink":"/document/6310175/","displayDocTitle":"Multiple Cumulants Based Spectrum Sensing Methods for Cognitive Radios","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiple Cumulants Based Spectrum Sensing Methods for Cognitive Radios","sourcePdf":"3620-tc1212-jun.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.069167S","chronDate":"December  2012","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"6389884","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"6389884","articleId":"6310175","onlineDate":"21 September 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6310293,"authors":[{"name":"Taobin Jin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Taobin","lastName":"Jin","id":"37589952100"},{"name":"Jun Zou","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jun","lastName":"Zou","id":"37276092500"},{"name":"Jiansheng Yuan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jiansheng","lastName":"Yuan","id":"37085467740"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1335-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1333-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-1334-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6310293","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":89},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Time domain analysis","Finite difference methods","Microwave filters","Computers","Microwave circuits","Antennas and propagation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["defected ground structures","electronic engineering computing","finite difference time-domain analysis","microwave circuits","parallel machines","virtual machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["transmission parameter","rectangle defected ground structure","parallel FDTD","region segmentation scheme","RDGS","serial finite difference time domain method","parallel virtual machine","PVM technique","serial FDTD approach"]}],"abstract":"It is time-consuming to calculate the transmission parameter (S\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">21</sub>\n) of the rectangle defected ground structure (RDGS), if the conventional serial finite difference time domain method (FDTD) is adopted.

Eddy current field is calculated and coupled to fluid and thermal model by means of element mapping. Temperature-dependent characteristics of materials constituting GIL are considered. As two different fluid species, insulating gas and ambient air are included in the model. Hence, unlike the generalized methodology, constant temperature boundary condition at the outer boundary of ambient air is substituted for heat transfer coefficient at the interface of surrounding air and the GIL enclosure. The concordance between the predicted temperature values and experimental results in the literature validates the accuracy of the model.","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 Sixth International Conference on Electromagnetic Field Problems and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/6302084/6310271/06310297.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"3","publicationTitle":"2012 Sixth International Conference on Electromagnetic Field Problems and Applications","doi":"10.1109/ICEF.2012.6310297","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICEF.2012.6310297","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6310271","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6310297","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Thermal Problems in Gas-Insulated Transmission Lines Solved by the Finite-Element Method","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Conductors","Fluids","Heat transfer","Heating","Sulfur hexafluoride","Finite element methods","Temperature distribution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["finite element analysis","gas insulated transmission lines","heat transfer"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["thermal problems","gas-insulated transmission line transient temperature distribution","finite-element method","FEM","GIL transient temperature distribution","eddy current field","element mapping","temperature-dependent characteristics","fluid species","constant temperature boundary condition","heat transfer coefficient"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6310297/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 June 2012","displayDocTitle":"Thermal Problems in Gas-Insulated Transmission Lines Solved by the Finite-Element Method","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6310297/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2012","accessionNumber":"13034918","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2012","conferenceDate":"19-21 June 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Thermal Problems in Gas-Insulated Transmission Lines Solved by the Finite-Element Method","confLoc":"Dalian, China","sourcePdf":"pid1130758.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040398S","chronDate":"19-21 June 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6302084","isNumber":"6310271","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6302084","xplore-issue":"6310271","articleId":"6310297","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6310325,"authors":[{"name":"Lei Liu","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Lei","lastName":"Liu","id":"37880780500"},{"name":"Junwei Lu","affiliation":["School of Engineering, Griffith University, Brisbane, Australia"],"firstName":"Junwei","lastName":"Lu","id":"37278636000"},{"name":"Shiyou Yang","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Shiyou","lastName":"Yang","id":"37292112100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1335-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1333-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-1334-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6310325","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":177},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Arrays","Vectors","Dielectrics","Antenna arrays","Bandwidth","MIMO"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","dielectric properties","evolutionary computation","finite element analysis","MIMO communication","multibeam antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimal design","dielectric embedded electronically switchable multiple beam antenna array","MIMO wireless communications","DE-ESMB antenna array","wireless routers","multi-objective evolutionary algorithm","FEM"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents a newly developed dielectric embedded electronically switchable multiple beam (DE-ESMB) antenna array for MIMO systems.

The results show that this method is an effective approach to solve image reconstruction for ECT, which is faster and more accurate compared with the BP neural network.","doi":"10.1109/ICEF.2012.6310416","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 Sixth International Conference on Electromagnetic Field Problems and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/6302084/6310271/06310416.pdf","publicationTitle":"2012 Sixth International Conference on Electromagnetic Field Problems and Applications","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICEF.2012.6310416","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6310271","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Image Reconstruction Algorithm Based on RBF Neural Network for Electrical Capacitance Tomography","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image reconstruction","Capacitance","Training","Biological neural networks","Finite element methods","Neurons"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["capacitance measurement","electric impedance imaging","image reconstruction","neural nets","radial basis function networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image reconstruction algorithm","radial basis function","RBF neural network","electrical capacitance tomography","measurement data"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6310416/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 June 2012","displayDocTitle":"An Image Reconstruction Algorithm Based on RBF Neural Network for Electrical Capacitance Tomography","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6310416/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2012","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2012","conferenceDate":"19-21 June 2012","accessionNumber":"13035026","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Image Reconstruction Algorithm Based on RBF Neural Network for Electrical Capacitance Tomography","confLoc":"Dalian, China","sourcePdf":"pid1133058.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042295S","chronDate":"19-21 June 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6302084","isNumber":"6310271","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6302084","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"6310271","articleId":"6310416","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":6310425,"authors":[{"name":"Tao Huang","firstName":"Tao","lastName":"Huang"},{"name":"Jiangjun Ruan","firstName":"Jiangjun","lastName":"Ruan"},{"name":"Mengyun Sun","firstName":"Mengyun","lastName":"Sun"},{"name":"Hailong Liu","firstName":"Hailong","lastName":"Liu"},{"name":"Weimin Guan","firstName":"Weimin","lastName":"Guan"},{"name":"Yujiao Zhang","firstName":"Yujiao","lastName":"Zhang"},{"name":"Caibo Liao","firstName":"Caibo","lastName":"Liao"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1335-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1333-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-1334-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6310425","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":146},"abstract":"In order to study the electromagnetic force distribution in the core of stator and rotor of an asynchronous motor, we conducted 2-D electromagnetic analysis using time-stepping finite element method (FEM) to calculate the magnetic field.

The proposed method finds the time delay from the room impulse response (RIR) which makes it robust against room reverberations. The RIR is considered a sparse phenomenon and a recently proposed sparse signal reconstruction technique called orthogonal clustering (OC) is utilized for its estimation from the low rate sampled received signal. The arrival time of the direct path signal at a pair of microphones is identified from the estimated RIR and their difference yields the desired time delay. Low sampling rates reduce the hardware and computational complexity and decrease the communication between the microphones and the centralized location. The performance of the proposed technique is demonstrated by numerical simulations and experimental results.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6310432","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSPA.2012.6310445","publicationTitle":"2012 11th International Conference on Information Science, Signal Processing and their Applications (ISSPA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 11th International Conference on Information Science, Signal Processing and their Applications (ISSPA)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6301984/6310432/06310445.pdf","startPage":"1050","endPage":"1055","doi":"10.1109/ISSPA.2012.6310445","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Time delay estimation in a reverberant environment by low rate sampling of impulsive acoustic sources","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 July 2012","displayDocTitle":"Time delay estimation in a reverberant environment by low rate sampling of impulsive acoustic sources","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"2-5 July 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6310445/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2012","accessionNumber":"13033275","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6310445/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Time delay estimation in a reverberant environment by low rate sampling of impulsive acoustic sources","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"p1050omer.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046865S","chronDate":"2-5 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6301984","isNumber":"6310432","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6301984","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6310432","articleId":"6310445","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6310467,"authors":[{"name":"Fauzia Ahmad","affiliation":["Radar Imaging Lab, Villanova University, Villanova, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Fauzia","lastName":"Ahmad","id":"37285133400"},{"name":"Moeness G.

Among the various techniques proposed for wall clutter mitigation under monostatic radar operation is subspace projection. This technique uses the strength of the wall EM reflections relative to that of the target to separate the wall subspace from the target subspace. In this paper, we present analyses of the subspace projection approach for suppressing wall clutter and preserving indoor targets in multi-input multi-output (MIMO) through-the-wall radar imaging systems. We highlight the similarities and the differences in performance of the subspace technique under MIMO and monostatic configurations.

In order to estimate the location of a target in azimuth without specifically steering the beams at the target or using special techniques such as monopulse, simple centroid schemes can be used. This assumes that a target is seen by more than one beam, which requires the beam pattern to be somewhat overlapping and that the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) of the target is sufficient. In this paper, a new azimuth centroid computation scheme using amplitude comparison is presented. Since the digital phased array beam shape is different at each azimuth, each beam is modeled by simple polynomial curve fitting. Simulation and preliminary experimental results show that the proposed method gives better azimuth accuracies compared to other centroid techniques.","doi":"10.1109/ISSPA.2012.6310468","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 11th International Conference on Information Science, Signal Processing and their Applications (ISSPA)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6301984/6310432/06310468.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6310432","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSPA.2012.6310468","publicationTitle":"2012 11th International Conference on Information Science, Signal Processing and their Applications (ISSPA)","startPage":"1171","endPage":"1176","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improved azimuth accuracy for a Digital Beamforming perimeter surveillance radar","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6310468","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 July 2012","displayDocTitle":"Improved azimuth accuracy for a Digital Beamforming perimeter surveillance radar","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6310468/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6310468/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2012","accessionNumber":"13033298","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2012","conferenceDate":"2-5 July 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improved azimuth accuracy for a Digital Beamforming perimeter surveillance radar","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"p1171sivagnanam.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053399S","chronDate":"2-5 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6301984","isNumber":"6310432","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6301984","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6310432","articleId":"6310468","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6310471,"authors":[{"name":"Sebastiano Impedovo","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Informatica, Universit\u00e0 degli Studi di Bari, Bari, Italy"],"firstName":"Sebastiano","lastName":"Impedovo","id":"37270023900"},{"name":"Francesco M.

As for normalization of modulation spectra, spectral histogram equalization (SHE) seems to be one of the most effective techniques that have been used to compensate the nonlinear distortion. In this paper, we investigate a novel use of polynomial-fitting techniques for modulation histogram equalization, which has the advantages of lower storage and time consumption when compared with the conventional SHE methods. Further, we also investigated the possibility of combining our approach with other temporal feature normalization methods. The automatic speech recognition (ASR) experiments were carried out on the Aurora-2 standard noise-robust ASR task. The performance of the proposed approach was thoroughly tested and verified by comparisons with the other popular modulation spectrum normalization methods, which suggests the utility of the proposed approach.","doi":"10.1109/ISSPA.2012.6310476","publicationTitle":"2012 11th International Conference on Information Science, Signal Processing and their Applications (ISSPA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 11th International Conference on Information Science, Signal Processing and their Applications (ISSPA)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6301984/6310432/06310476.pdf","startPage":"120","endPage":"125","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSPA.2012.6310476","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6310432","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Leveraging distributional characteristics of modulation spectra for robust speech recognition","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6310476","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 July 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6310476/","displayDocTitle":"Leveraging distributional characteristics of modulation spectra for robust speech recognition","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2012","accessionNumber":"13033306","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6310476/","conferenceDate":"2-5 July 2012","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Leveraging distributional characteristics of modulation spectra for robust speech recognition","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"p120kao.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059296S","chronDate":"2-5 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6301984","isNumber":"6310432","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6301984","xplore-issue":"6310432","articleId":"6310476","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6310501,"authors":[{"name":"Pierre Blache","affiliation":["Facult\u00e9 des Sciences et Techniques LIEN, BP 239, University of Lorraine, France"],"firstName":"Pierre","lastName":"Blache","id":"37086678099"},{"name":"Hassan Rabah","affiliation":["College of Engineering Dept. of Electrical Engineering Qatar University"],"firstName":"Hassan","lastName":"Rabah","id":"37277808200"},{"name":"Abbes Amira","affiliation":["NIBEC, University of Ulster, UK"],"firstName":"Abbes","lastName":"Amira","id":"37270846500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0382-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0381-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0380-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6310501","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":25,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":597},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Kernel","Matrix decomposition","Computer architecture","Vectors","Hardware","Matching pursuit algorithms","Symmetric matrices"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compressed sensing","digital signal processing chips","field programmable gate arrays","matrix multiplication","signal reconstruction","vectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high level prototyping","orthogonal matching pursuit algorithm","hardware architecture","signal reconstruction","compressed sensing","Simulink","Xilinx system generator","area optimisation","execution time optimisation","execution time reduction","kernel","matrix vector multiplication","Virtex5 FPGA","Intel core duo CPU"]}],"abstract":"In this paper we present a novel hardware architecture for reconstruction of signals in compressed sensing. The proposed architecture is based on the orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) algorithm which has been modeled with Simulink and implemented on FPGA using Xilinx system generator. The main aim is to optimize both area and execution time. The execution time is reduced by exploiting parallelism inside each kernel, where the area is reduced by reusing several operators such as matrix vector multiplication. Hardware implementation on the Virtex5 FPGA has shown excellent results compared to existing implementations. Moreover, our solution achieves a speedup of 38 compared to a software solution on the Intel core duo CPU.","publicationTitle":"2012 11th International Conference on Information Science, Signal Processing and their Applications (ISSPA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 11th International Conference on Information Science, Signal Processing and their Applications (ISSPA)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6301984/6310432/06310501.pdf","startPage":"1336","endPage":"1340","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High level prototyping and FPGA implementation of the orthogonal matching pursuit algorithm","doi":"10.1109/ISSPA.2012.6310501","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6310432","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSPA.2012.6310501","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6310501","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6310501/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 July 2012","displayDocTitle":"High level prototyping and FPGA implementation of the orthogonal matching pursuit algorithm","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2012","publicationDate":"July 2012","accessionNumber":"13033331","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"2-5 July 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6310501/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High level prototyping and FPGA implementation of the orthogonal matching pursuit algorithm","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"p1336blache.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039911S","chronDate":"2-5 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6301984","isNumber":"6310432","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6301984","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"6310432","articleId":"6310501","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6310503,"authors":[{"name":"Eva Lagunas","affiliation":["Universitat Polit\u00e1cnica de Catalunya (UPC), Barcelona, Spain"],"firstName":"Eva","lastName":"Lagunas","id":"37972945800"},{"name":"Moeness G.

The goal is to enable behind-the-wall target detection and localization from reduced data measurements. In the underlying problem, few frequency observations are available and they differ from one antenna position to another in a SAR imaging system. Because of using a different set of frequencies for different antennas, direct applications of wall clutter mitigation methods, such as subspace and spatial filtering, prove ineffective. To provide these methods with the response measured at the same set of frequencies, a compressive sensing approach is used to reconstruct the range profiles. We use prior knowledge of the wall standoff distance to speed up the convergence of the Orthogonal Matching Pursuit for sparse data reconstruction.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Compressive sensing for through wall radar imaging of stationary scenes using arbitrary data measurements","publicationTitle":"2012 11th International Conference on Information Science, Signal Processing and their Applications (ISSPA)","doi":"10.1109/ISSPA.2012.6310503","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 11th International Conference on Information Science, Signal Processing and their Applications (ISSPA)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6301984/6310432/06310503.pdf","startPage":"1347","endPage":"1352","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSPA.2012.6310503","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6310432","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6310503","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6310503/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 July 2012","displayDocTitle":"Compressive sensing for through wall radar imaging of stationary scenes using arbitrary data measurements","conferenceDate":"2-5 July 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6310503/","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2012","publicationDate":"July 2012","accessionNumber":"13033333","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Compressive sensing for through wall radar imaging of stationary scenes using arbitrary data measurements","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"p1347lagunas.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06606S","chronDate":"2-5 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6301984","isNumber":"6310432","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6301984","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6310432","articleId":"6310503","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6310505,"authors":[{"name":"Ozgur Ozdemir","affiliation":["Qatar University, Doha, Ad Dawhah, QA"],"firstName":"Ozgur","lastName":"Ozdemir"},{"name":"Ridha Hamila","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, The University of Texas at Dallas, Dallas, USA"],"firstName":"Ridha","lastName":"Hamila","id":"37282475100"},{"name":"Naofal Al-Dhahir","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, The University of Texas at Dallas, Dallas, USA"],"firstName":"Naofal","lastName":"Al-Dhahir","id":"37269044000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0382-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0381-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0380-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6310505","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":164},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Array signal processing","Vectors","Channel estimation","Receivers","Noise","Joints"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","channel estimation","MIMO communication","OFDM modulation","radio transceivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiple beamforming OFDM transceivers","asymmetric frequency-dependent joint transmit-receive I-Q imbalance compensation","multiple beamforming MIMO OFDM systems","throughput-maximizing TX-RX beamforming coefficients","channel estimation","generalized multiple beamforming scheme","I-Q imbalance effect mitigation","multiple beamforming data rate","low-complexity pilot-aided scheme"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we investigate the effects of asymmetric frequency-dependent joint transmit-receive I/Q imbalance on the performance of multiple beamforming MIMO OFDM systems.

Previous research was evaluated by simulating the IEEE UWB channel model. This paper studies the behavior of compressive sensing for practical UWB signals and proposes approaches to enhance the signal reconstruction performance. Four practically-based dictionaries are proposed to increase the sparsity of the realistic UWB signals. Those dictionaries accounts for the practical effects of the channel like pulse dispersion and the unavoidable effects of the antenna directivity. Both measured data and a more practical directional model are used for evaluation. It is shown that CS based on the new dictionaries is able to reconstruct the practical UWB signals more efficiently with reasonable complexity.","doi":"10.1109/ISSPA.2012.6310506","publicationTitle":"2012 11th International Conference on Information Science, Signal Processing and their Applications (ISSPA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 11th International Conference on Information Science, Signal Processing and their Applications (ISSPA)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6301984/6310432/06310506.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSPA.2012.6310506","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6310432","startPage":"1365","endPage":"1370","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Practical implementation of compressive sensing to UWB signals","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6310506","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Practical implementation of compressive sensing to UWB signals","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 July 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6310506/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"2-5 July 2012","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2012","accessionNumber":"13033336","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6310506/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Practical implementation of compressive sensing to UWB signals","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"p1365alkhodary.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068574S","chronDate":"2-5 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6301984","isNumber":"6310432","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6301984","xplore-issue":"6310432","articleId":"6310506","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6310512,"authors":[{"name":"Luca Pot\u00ec","affiliation":["Photonic Network National Laboratory, CNIT, Pisa, Italy"],"firstName":"Luca","lastName":"Pot\u00ec","id":"37270975800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0382-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0381-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0380-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6310512","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":97},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optical fibers","Fiber nonlinear optics","Photonics","Optical receivers","Optical transmitters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optical communication","optical information processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital processing","optical communications","electrical domain","all-optical technologies","electronics bandwidth limitation","coherent communications","algorithm complexity","nonlinear fibre impairments","optical domain"]}],"abstract":"Digital processing role in the optical communications is analyzed together with its historical evolution and perspectives. If optical systems at their early stage included weak digital processing in the electrical domain, a fast evolution towards completely all-optical technologies arises due to the bottleneck caused by the electronics bandwidth limitation. With the return of coherent communications, digital processing migrated again back to the electronic domain. Nowadays, algorithm complexity capable of mitigating for linear and nonlinear fibre impairments is becoming unsustainable due to huge level of parallelization and power demand. For such a reason one possible evolution will include processing both in the electronic and optical domain.","doi":"10.1109/ISSPA.2012.6310512","publicationTitle":"2012 11th International Conference on Information Science, Signal Processing and their Applications (ISSPA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 11th International Conference on Information Science, Signal Processing and their Applications (ISSPA)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6301984/6310432/06310512.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSPA.2012.6310512","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6310432","startPage":"1390","endPage":"1395","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Digital processing in the optical communications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6310512","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Digital processing in the optical communications","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 July 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6310512/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"2-5 July 2012","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2012","accessionNumber":"13033342","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6310512/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Digital processing in the optical communications","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"p1390poti.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.399882S","chronDate":"2-5 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6301984","isNumber":"6310432","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6301984","xplore-issue":"6310432","articleId":"6310512","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6310524,"authors":[{"name":"Zangen Zhu","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, SK, Canada"],"firstName":"Zangen","lastName":"Zhu","id":"38486941900"},{"name":"Khan Wahid","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, SK, Canada"],"firstName":"Khan","lastName":"Wahid","id":"37282919600"},{"name":"Paul Babyn","affiliation":["MedicaI Imaging, University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, SK, Canada"],"firstName":"Paul","lastName":"Babyn","id":"37296011100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0382-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0381-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0380-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6310524","dbTime":"32 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":147},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image reconstruction","Computed tomography","Compressed sensing","Subspace constraints","Transforms","In vivo"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compressed sensing","computerised tomography","image reconstruction","image sampling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compressed sensing","CT image reconstruction algorithm","sampling rate","image quality"]}],"abstract":"This paper propose a compressed sensing based CT image reconstruction algorithm.

cooperative spectrum sensing for Cognitive Radio Ad-Hoc Network: Hidden terminal awareness approach","abstract":"In Cognitive Radio Network, secondary users opportunistically use the licensed channels to transmit data. The secondary users first conduct the local sensing to determine the unoccupied channels and then choose the satisfied channel in the available channel set to transmit. However, the sensing results might not be accurate due to many problems: channel fading or shadowing, noise, hidden primary users or the aggregated interference caused by other secondary user transmissions. In this paper, we are interested in improving the spectrum sensing performance by reducing the missed-detection sensing caused by the hidden primary user problem. Particularly, we first proposed the channel state transition diagram capturing the hidden terminal possibility and then developed a collaborative scheme to exchange the sensing result between secondary users. Based on the summarized sensing results achieved from secondary user neighbors and local sensing, each secondary will build its own channel table listing all available channels. Numerical results show that the proposed spectrum sensing scheme enhances the sensing results and the network performance.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 July 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6310535/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"13033365","publicationDate":"July 2012","conferenceDate":"2-5 July 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6310535/","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Decentralized cooperative spectrum sensing for Cognitive Radio Ad-Hoc Network: Hidden terminal awareness approach","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Decentralized cooperative spectrum sensing for Cognitive Radio Ad-Hoc Network: Hidden terminal awareness approach","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"p146lam.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066775S","chronDate":"2-5 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6301984","isNumber":"6310432","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6301984","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6310432","articleId":"6310535","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6310562,"authors":[{"name":"Masahito Togami","affiliation":["Central Research Laboratory, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Masahito","lastName":"Togami","id":"37569544400"},{"name":"Yohei Kawaguchi","affiliation":["Central Research Laboratory, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Yohei","lastName":"Kawaguchi","id":"37577190700"},{"name":"Nobuo Nukaga","affiliation":["Central Research Laboratory, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Nobuo","lastName":"Nukaga","id":"37870155600"},{"name":"Yasunari Obuchi","affiliation":["Central Research Laboratory, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Yasunari","lastName":"Obuchi","id":"37429047400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0382-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0381-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0380-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6310562","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":45},"abstract":"A noise-robust MVBF adaptation technique under diffuse noise environments is proposed.

The online sparseness based MVBF adaptation is sensitive to diffuse noise, because diffuse noise is not sparse. However, by using diffuse noise pre-filtering based on local Gaussian modeling which can be regarded as an optimized MIMO(Multi-Input Multi-Output) diffuse noise reduction method from the probabilistic perspective, sparseness of the microphone input signal into the latter part is expected to be improved. The proposed method is evaluated by using speech signal under diffuse noise environments, and the proposed method can reduce more noise source with less distortion than the conventional online sparseness based MVBF adaptation.","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 11th International Conference on Information Science, Signal Processing and their Applications (ISSPA)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6301984/6310432/06310562.pdf","startPage":"292","endPage":"297","publicationTitle":"2012 11th International Conference on Information Science, Signal Processing and their Applications (ISSPA)","doi":"10.1109/ISSPA.2012.6310562","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSPA.2012.6310562","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6310432","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6310562","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Online mvbf adaptation under diffuse noise environments with mimo based noise pre-filtering","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Noise","Speech","Microphones","MIMO","Covariance matrix","Time frequency analysis","Noise reduction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","filtering theory","Gaussian processes","MIMO communication","probability","signal denoising","speech processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["diffuse noise environments","MIMO based noise prefiltering","noise-robust MVBF adaptation technique","semionline diffuse noise reduction","speech sources","online sparseness based MVBF adaptation technique","local Gaussian modeling","multiinput multioutput diffuse noise reduction method","optimized MIMO diffuse noise reduction method","microphone input signal","speech signal","minimum variance beamformer technique"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6310562/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 July 2012","displayDocTitle":"Online mvbf adaptation under diffuse noise environments with mimo based noise pre-filtering","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6310562/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2012","accessionNumber":"13033392","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2012","conferenceDate":"2-5 July 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Online mvbf adaptation under diffuse noise environments with mimo based noise pre-filtering","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"p292togami.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.13249S","chronDate":"2-5 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6301984","isNumber":"6310432","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6301984","xplore-issue":"6310432","articleId":"6310562","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6310567,"authors":[{"name":"Fatma Abdelkefi","affiliation":["University of Carthage, High School of Communications of Tunis (SUPCOM), Tunisia"],"firstName":"Fatma","lastName":"Abdelkefi","id":"38478613200"},{"name":"Jaouhar Ayadi","affiliation":["ECLEXYS -

Due to the presence of uncorrelated noise components at the two inputs in vehicular environments, ANC does not provide sufficient background noise reduction. To alleviate this problem, a complementary linear filter is added to ANC structure. Filter coefficients are determined to make the enhanced signal an MMSE estimation of speech signal. Therefore, the ANC structure is modified to a dual-channel Wiener structure. We prove that this structure is identical to the LMS type ANC which is followed by a Wiener post-filter. A new method is proposed for the noise spectrum estimation in the Wiener post-filter. This method does not require Voice Activity Detectors (VADs) and performs better speech enhancement in nonstationary noisy environments. Experimental results show that the proposed system can overcome the problem efficiently, at the cost of more complexity and more speech distortion.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6310589/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 July 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"2-5 July 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2012","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6310589/","accessionNumber":"13033419","displayDocTitle":"An optimum MMSE post-filter for Adaptive Noise Cancellation in automobile environment","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An optimum MMSE post-filter for Adaptive Noise Cancellation in automobile environment","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"p431khorram.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057821S","chronDate":"2-5 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6301984","isNumber":"6310432","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6301984","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6310432","articleId":"6310589","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6310608,"authors":[{"name":"Isaac Nickaein","affiliation":["Image Processing and Pattern Recognition Lab, Amirkabir University of Technology, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Isaac","lastName":"Nickaein","id":"37086765417"},{"name":"Mohammad Rahmati","affiliation":["Image Processing and Pattern Recognition Lab, Amirkabir University of Technology, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Mohammad","lastName":"Rahmati","id":"37300414400"},{"name":"Saeed Shiry Ghidary","affiliation":["Image Processing and Pattern Recognition Lab, Amirkabir University of Technology, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Saeed Shiry","lastName":"Ghidary","id":"37443997200"},{"name":"Abtin Zohrabi","affiliation":["Abtin Zohrabi, University of New Brunswick, Canada"],"firstName":"Abtin","lastName":"Zohrabi","id":"37086764273"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0382-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0381-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0380-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6310608","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":115},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bit rate","Decoding","Encoding","Estimation","Video coding","Neural networks","Video sequences"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decoding","encoding","feedback","neural nets","video codecs","video coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feedback-free video coding","hybrid distributed video coding","neural network","DVC","video coding technique","decentralized video sources","Stanford Wyner-Ziv codec","feedback channel","decoder","encoder","parity bits","bitrate estimation","computational complexity"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Distributed video coding","Wyner-Ziv (WZ) video coding","bitrate estimation","encoder rate control"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6310608","abstract":"Distributed Video Coding (DVC) is a new class of video coding techniques with the aim of coding the decentralized video sources. While the Stanford Wyner-Ziv codec is a well-known architecture in DVC literature, one of its main drawbacks is the presence of a feedback channel from the decoder to the encoder. This feedback channel makes the use of the codec impractical in some applications. Since the only application of the feedback channel is in requesting more parity bits from the encoder, it could be omitted if the encoder estimates the required parity bits and sends them at once. In this paper, a new method of bitrate estimation using a neural network trained by a new set of features is proposed. In addition, a Hybrid mode is proposed that reduces computational complexity at the decoder in a conventional Wyner-Ziv codec.","doi":"10.1109/ISSPA.2012.6310608","startPage":"528","endPage":"532","publicationTitle":"2012 11th International Conference on Information Science, Signal Processing and their Applications (ISSPA)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSPA.2012.6310608","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6310432","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 11th International Conference on Information Science, Signal Processing and their Applications (ISSPA)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6301984/6310432/06310608.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Feedback-free and hybrid distributed video coding using neural networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6310608/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Feedback-free and hybrid distributed video coding using neural networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6310608/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"13033438","publicationDate":"July 2012","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2012","conferenceDate":"2-5 July 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 July 2012","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Feedback-free and hybrid distributed video coding using neural networks","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"p528nickaein.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048999S","chronDate":"2-5 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6301984","isNumber":"6310432","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6301984","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6310432","articleId":"6310608","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6310611,"authors":[{"name":"Muhammad Martuza","affiliation":["Dept. of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, Canada"],"firstName":"Muhammad","lastName":"Martuza","id":"38483803200"},{"name":"Carl McCrosky","affiliation":["Dept. of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, Canada"],"firstName":"Carl","lastName":"McCrosky","id":"37313249100"},{"name":"Khan Wahid","affiliation":["Dept. of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, Canada"],"firstName":"Khan","lastName":"Wahid","id":"37282919600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0382-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0381-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0380-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6310611","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":228},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Transform coding","Standards","Computer architecture","Matrix decomposition","Video coding","Hardware","Decoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive codes","adders","code standards","discrete cosine transforms","field programmable gate arrays","inverse transforms","matrix decomposition","video coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["H.264","VC-1","MPEG-2","AVS","JPEG codec","inverse discrete cosine transform","AVC","matrix factorizing algorithm","IDCT","delta mapping scheme","hardware share approach","adder","shifter","FPGA","CMOS","super resolution video coding","size 0.18 mum"]}],"abstract":"The paper presents a hybrid algorithm to compute the 8\u00d78 Integer Inverse Discrete Cosine Transform (IDCT) of multiple modern codecs - AVS, VC-1, H.264/AVC, JPEG and MPEG-2.

To reduce the hardware complexities we implement the last two standards by delta mapping scheme from the architecture of VC-1. The combination of these two hardware share approach ensures the maximum circuit reuse during the computation.

In a limited-feedback MIMO system, the feedback overhead from the receiver to the transmitter is significantly reduced by using a codebook. The codebook is made up of finite set of precoding matrix that is predetermined by quantizing the CSI. The receiver selects the best precoding matrix and sends back only the index of the selected precoding matrix. However, in MIMO-OFDM if the precoding is performed per subcarrier, the feedback overhead still remains large. Therefore, to reduce the amount of feedback one precoder per a group or band of subcarriers is used. In this paper we develop reduced-complexity algorithms that select the best precoding matrix per band of subcarriers. We also derive rank adaptation algorithm for further performance improvement.","doi":"10.1109/ISSPA.2012.6310614","publicationTitle":"2012 11th International Conference on Information Science, Signal Processing and their Applications (ISSPA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 11th International Conference on Information Science, Signal Processing and their Applications (ISSPA)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6301984/6310432/06310614.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSPA.2012.6310614","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6310432","startPage":"555","endPage":"560","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Precoder selection and rank adaptation in MIMO-OFDM","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6310614","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Precoder selection and rank adaptation in MIMO-OFDM","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 July 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6310614/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"2-5 July 2012","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2012","accessionNumber":"13033444","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6310614/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Precoder selection and rank adaptation in MIMO-OFDM","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"p555ghirmai.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.082202S","chronDate":"2-5 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6301984","isNumber":"6310432","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6301984","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6310432","articleId":"6310614","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6310616,"authors":[{"name":"Hocine Ait Saadi","affiliation":["Universite Laval, Departement de genie electrique et de genie informatique, Quebec, Canada"],"firstName":"Hocine Ait","lastName":"Saadi","id":"37719846100"},{"name":"Jean-Yves Chouinard","affiliation":["Universite Laval, Departement de genie electrique et de genie informatique, Quebec, Canada"],"firstName":"Jean-Yves","lastName":"Chouinard","id":"37274195300"},{"name":"Abderrezak Guessoum","affiliation":["Universite Laval, Departement de genie electrique et de genie informatique, Quebec, Canada"],"firstName":"Abderrezak","lastName":"Guessoum","id":"38562134100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0382-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0381-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0380-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6310616","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":174},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Peak to average power ratio","Partial transmit sequences","Sociology","Statistics","Bit error rate","Vectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","evolutionary computation","OFDM modulation","power amplifiers","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed differential evolution algorithm","PAPR reduction","OFDM signal","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","multicarrier scheme","frequency selective fading mitigation","HPA","high power amplifier","partial transmit sequence method","PTS method","high computational complexity","DDE","control parameters","self adaptation","wireless channels"]}],"abstract":"Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) is a very powerful multicarrier scheme to mitigate frequency selective fading in wireless channels. However OFDM is affected by high peak to average power ratio (PAPR) conditions. A signal with high PAPR causes severe transmission problems due to the non linearity of high power amplifier (HPA) used at the transmitter end. One of the most promising methods proposed to reduce the PAPR consists of acting on the rotation phases of the OFDM symbols: this is known as the partial transmit sequence (PTS) method. Although this method achieves significant PAPR reduction, it requires an exhaustive search thus has a high computational complexity. To reduce this complexity, we propose in this paper a suboptimal algorithm based on distributed differential evolution algorithm (DDE) with self adaptation of the control parameters. The performance in PAPR reduction is close to that of the optimal case but with a significantly lower number of searches thus leading to a reduction in computational complexity.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed differential evolution algorithm for PAPR reduction of OFDM signals","publicationTitle":"2012 11th International Conference on Information Science, Signal Processing and their Applications (ISSPA)","doi":"10.1109/ISSPA.2012.6310616","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 11th International Conference on Information Science, Signal Processing and their Applications (ISSPA)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6301984/6310432/06310616.pdf","startPage":"567","endPage":"572","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSPA.2012.6310616","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6310432","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6310616","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6310616/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 July 2012","displayDocTitle":"Distributed differential evolution algorithm for PAPR reduction of OFDM signals","conferenceDate":"2-5 July 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6310616/","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2012","publicationDate":"July 2012","accessionNumber":"13033446","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed differential evolution algorithm for PAPR reduction of OFDM signals","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"p567aitsaadi.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.106565S","chronDate":"2-5 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6301984","isNumber":"6310432","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6301984","xplore-issue":"6310432","articleId":"6310616","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6310625,"authors":[{"name":"Srdjan Stankovi\u0107","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical Engineering, University of Montenegro, Podgorica, Montenegro"],"firstName":"Srdjan","lastName":"Stankovi\u0107","id":"37430155300"},{"name":"Irena Orovi\u0107","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical Engineering, University of Montenegro, Podgorica, Montenegro"],"firstName":"Irena","lastName":"Orovi\u0107","id":"37645659200"},{"name":"Moeness Amin","affiliation":["Center for Advanced Communications, Villanova University, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Moeness","lastName":"Amin","id":"37284577300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0382-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0381-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0380-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6310625","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":14,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":371},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Time frequency analysis","Robustness","Standards","Compressed sensing","Gaussian noise","Minimization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compressed sensing","estimation theory","signal reconstruction","signal representation","time-frequency analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compressed sensing","time-frequency signal representation","heavy-tailed noise","time-frequency distribution","sparse time-frequency signal reconstruction","signal power localization","robust ambiguity function","L-estimation approach","sparse time-frequency trajectory enhancement","signal component","nonGaussian noise"]}],"abstract":"A compressed sensing approach for robust time-frequency analysis of signals corrupted by strong heavy-tailed noise is proposed.

Classical beamforming techniques have been used in order to eliminate the existing ICI and enhance the capacity of downlink cooperative Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) transmission systems. However, a perfect knowledge of the Channel State Information (CSI) at the transmitter is needed in order to perform an adequate beamforming such as the Block-Diagonalization preprocessing. In practice, this is not the case due to the presence of channel estimation errors. In this paper, we model this multicell cooperative system under the presence of channel estimation errors that are often neglected but that can significantly influence the obtained results. In addition, we consider a general framework where the power that is transmitted from the base stations to the mobile stations is not constrained to be identical. To ensure zero-ICI, the beamforming is deduced from the entire null space spanned by the signals transmitted by the other users. Then, we evaluate the sum rate expression and we propose efficient alternatives in order to improve it without coupling the beamforming and the power control processes. Simulation results are given to support our claims.","pdfPath":"/iel5/6301984/6310432/06310636.pdf","startPage":"660","endPage":"665","publicationTitle":"2012 11th International Conference on Information Science, Signal Processing and their Applications (ISSPA)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6310432","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSPA.2012.6310636","doi":"10.1109/ISSPA.2012.6310636","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 11th International Conference on Information Science, Signal Processing and their Applications (ISSPA)","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6310636","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Array signal processing","Vectors","Transmitters","Channel estimation","Downlink","Noise","Interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","cooperative communication","interference suppression","MIMO communication","radiofrequency interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multicell cooperative base station","channel estimation errors","intercell interference mitigation","classical beamforming technique","MIMO transmission system","downlink cooperative multiple input multiple output transmission system","channel state information","CSI","block-diagonalization preprocessing","zero-ICI","signals transmission","power control process"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 July 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6310636/","displayDocTitle":"Multicell cooperative base stations in presence of channel estimation errors","accessionNumber":"13033466","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2012","publicationDate":"July 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6310636/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"2-5 July 2012","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multicell cooperative base stations in presence of channel estimation errors","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"p660fki.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046297S","chronDate":"2-5 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6301984","isNumber":"6310432","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6301984","xplore-issue":"6310432","articleId":"6310636","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6310643,"authors":[{"name":"Udochukwu Ogbureke","affiliation":["CNGL, School of Computer Science and Informatics, University College Dublin, Belfield, Ireland"],"firstName":"Udochukwu","lastName":"Ogbureke","id":"37086653794"},{"name":"Joao Cabral","affiliation":["CNGL, School of Computer Science and Informatics, University College Dublin, Belfield, Ireland"],"firstName":"Joao","lastName":"Cabral","id":"38477322500"},{"name":"Julie Berndsen","affiliation":["CNGL, School of Computer Science and Informatics, University College Dublin, Belfield, Ireland"],"firstName":"Julie","lastName":"Berndsen","id":"37086655836"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0382-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0381-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0380-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6310643","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":170},"abstract":"This paper presents a novel approach to explicit duration modelling for HMM-based speech synthesis. The proposed approach is a two-step process. The first step in this process is state level phone alignment and conversion of phone durations into the number of frames. In the second step, a hidden Markov model (HMM) is trained whereby the observation is the number of frames in each state and the hidden state the phone. Finally, the duration of each state (the number of frames) is generated from the trained HMM. Hidden semi-Markov model (HSMM) is the baseline for explicit duration modelling in HMM-based speech synthesis. Both objective and perceptual evaluation on a held-out test set showed comparable results with a baseline HSMM-based speech synthesis. This duration modelling approach is computationally simpler than HSMM and produces comparable results in terms of the quality of synthetic speech.","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 11th International

While a multi-sample fusion architecture reduces false rejects, it also increases false accepts. This impact on performance also depends on the nature of subsequent attempts, i.e., random or adaptive. Expressions for error rates are presented and experimentally evaluated in this work by considering the multi-sample fusion architecture for text-dependent speaker verification using HMM based digit dependent speaker models. Analysis incorporating correlation modeling demonstrates that the use of adaptive samples improves overall fusion performance compared to randomly repeated samples. For a text dependent speaker verification system using digit strings, sequential decision fusion of seven instances with three random samples is shown to reduce the overall error of the verification system by 26% which can be further reduced by 6% for adaptive samples. This analysis novel in its treatment of random and adaptive multiple presentations within a sequential fused decision architecture, is also applicable to other biometric modalities such as finger prints and handwriting samples.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6310657/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 July 2012","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"2-5 July 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6310657/","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2012","publicationDate":"July 2012","accessionNumber":"13033487","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Sequential fusion of decisions from adaptive and random samples for controlled verification errors","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sequential fusion of decisions from adaptive and random samples for controlled verification errors","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"p776nallagatla.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04347S","chronDate":"2-5 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6301984","isNumber":"6310432","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6301984","xplore-issue":"6310432","articleId":"6310657","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6310664,"authors":[{"name":"Azam Karami","affiliation":["Department of Communications and Electronics, School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Shiraz University, Shiraz, Iran"],"firstName":"Azam","lastName":"Karami","id":"37586141900"},{"name":"Soosan Beheshti","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Ryerson University, Toronto, Canada"],"firstName":"Soosan","lastName":"Beheshti","id":"37397290600"},{"name":"Mehran Yazdi","affiliation":["Department of Communications and Electronics, School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Shiraz University, Shiraz, Iran"],"firstName":"Mehran","lastName":"Yazdi","id":"37266169900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0382-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0381-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0380-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6310664","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":343},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Support vector machines","Hyperspectral imaging","Discrete cosine transforms","Image coding","Image reconstruction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data compression","discrete cosine transforms","image coding","learning (artificial intelligence)","support vector machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hyperspectral image compression","3D discrete cosine transform","support vector machine learning","three-dimensional discrete cosine transform","3D-DCT","SVM","hyperspectral images"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Hyperspectral Images","Support Vector Machine","Three Dimensional Discrete Cosine Transform","Image Compression"]}],"abstract":"Hyperspectral images exhibit significant spectral correlation, whose exploitation is crucial for compression. In this paper, an efficient method for hyperspectral image compression is presented using the three-dimensional discrete cosine transform (3D-DCT) and support vector machine (SVM). The core idea behind our proposed technique is to apply SVM on the 3D-DCT coefficients of hyperspectral images in order to determine which coefficients (support vectors) are more critical for being preserved. Our method not only exploits redundancies between the bands, but also uses spatial correlations of every image band. Consequently, as simulation results applied to real hyperspectral images demonstrate, the proposed method leads to a remarkable compression ratio and quality.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hyperspectral image compression using 3D discrete cosine transform and support vector machine learning","publicationTitle":"2012 11th International Conference on Information Science, Signal Processing and their Applications (ISSPA)","doi":"10.1109/ISSPA.2012.6310664","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 11th International Conference on Information Science, Signal Processing and their Applications (ISSPA)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6301984/6310432/06310664.pdf","startPage":"809","endPage":"812","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSPA.2012.6310664","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6310432","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6310664","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6310664/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 July 2012","displayDocTitle":"Hyperspectral image compression using 3D discrete cosine transform and support vector machine learning","conferenceDate":"2-5 July 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6310664/","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2012","publicationDate":"July 2012","accessionNumber":"13033494","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hyperspectral image compression using 3D discrete cosine transform and support vector machine learning","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"p809karami.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066617S","chronDate":"2-5 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6301984","isNumber":"6310432","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6301984","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6310432","articleId":"6310664","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6310668,"authors":[{"name":"Malika-Djahida Kedir-Talha","affiliation":["USTHB, Laboratory of instrumentation, Algiers, Algeria"],"firstName":"Malika-Djahida","lastName":"Kedir-Talha","id":"38305874600"},{"name":"Saliha Ould-Slimane","affiliation":["USTHB, Laboratory of instrumentation, Algiers, Algeria"],"firstName":"Saliha","lastName":"Ould-Slimane","id":"38296531500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0382-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0381-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0380-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6310668","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":243},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Heart beat","Electrocardiography","Support vector machines","Libraries","Kernel","Training","Optimization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electrocardiography","patient diagnosis","radial basis function networks","support vector machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["heartbeat classification","cardiac dysfunctions diagnosis","long-term ECG signal recordings","heartbeat modelling","support vector machines","SVM classification algorithm","neural networks learning","generalized orthogonal forward regression","GOFR algorithm","Gaussians","MIT-BIH arrhythmia database","SVM algorithm","radial basis function kernel","SVM diagnostic system"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6310668","abstract":"The diagnosis of cardiac dysfunctions requires the analysis of long-term ECG signal recordings, often containing hundreds to thousands of heartbeats.

orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) over highly-selective fading channels for Long Term Evolution (LTE) systems. The conventional Alamouti STBC receiver suffers from performance degradation when the channel is not constant during the period of Alamouti codeword transmission. The principle of the new method is a modification of MIMO decoding at the receiver to adapt to the channel variations and improve consequently the link reliability of LTE system. Performance evaluation of the proposed method is confirmed by simulations and through a comparative study with well-known MIMO coding methods; the Vertical Bell-Labs layered Space Time Block code (VBLAST-STBC) and Golden Space-Time Trellis Code (Golden STTC). Also, performance evaluation, using estimated channels by the standard methods; Wiener estimator and Spline interpolator confirm that the modified Alamouti-based method can adapt to the channel variations and give a better channel equalization even over highly-selective fading estimated channels which subsequently improve the service quality and the link reliability.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6310690/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 July 2012","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"2-5 July 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6310690/","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2012","publicationDate":"July 2012","accessionNumber":"13029550","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Modified Alamouti decoding for highly selective channels for LTE systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modified Alamouti decoding for highly selective channels for LTE systems","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"p940omri.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05051S","chronDate":"2-5 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6301984","isNumber":"6310432","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6301984","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6310432","articleId":"6310690","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6310692,"authors":[{"name":"Imad Barhumi","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering, United Arab Emirates University, A1-Ain, UAE"],"firstName":"Imad","lastName":"Barhumi","id":"38480400700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0382-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0381-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0380-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6310692","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":155},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6310692","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Equalizers","OFDM","Frequency domain analysis","Covariance matrix","Decoding","Vectors","Detectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["approximation theory","channel coding","fading channels","FIR filters","Gaussian processes","least mean squares methods","multipath channels","numerical analysis","OFDM modulation","quadrature phase shift keying","time-varying channels","turbo codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["linear minimum mean square error turbo equalization scheme","LMMSE turbo code equalization","doubly selective channel","multicarrier system","MC system","single carrier system","SC system","CE-BEM","time-varying multipath fading channel","time-invariant FIR filter","time-varying complex exponential basis function model","Gaussian approximation","extrinsic information","a-posteriori information","a-priori information","QPSK modulation","orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing","OFDM","numerical simulation"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6310432","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 11th International Conference on Information Science, Signal Processing and their Applications (ISSPA)","publicationTitle":"2012 11th International Conference on Information Science, Signal Processing and their Applications (ISSPA)","doi":"10.1109/ISSPA.2012.6310692","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Minimum mean square error turbo equalization of doubly selective channels using the BEM","startPage":"951","endPage":"955","pdfPath":"/iel5/6301984/6310432/06310692.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSPA.2012.6310692","abstract":"In this paper, linear minimum mean square error (LMMSE) turbo equalization for transmission over doubly selective channels is proposed for single carrier (SC) as well as for multi-carrier (MC) systems.

The existing literature on cooperative channel estimation assumes block lengths are long and that channel estimation takes place within a fading block. To reduce the forwarding delay, short block lengths are preferred and adaptive estimation through multiple blocks is required. In this paper, we consider estimating the relay-to-destination channel in decode-and-forward relay systems for which the presence of training data is probabilistic since it is unknown whether the relay participates in the forwarding round. A detector is used before the update of the least mean square channel estimate so that an update is made only when the detector decides the presence of training data. We use the generalized likelihood ratio test and focus on the detector threshold for deciding whether the training sequence is present. To improve the convergence speed and reduce the estimation error, a heuristic objective function is proposed which leads to an proper threshold. Extensive numerical results show the superior performance of using this threshold as opposed to fixed thresholds.","publicationTitle":"2012 46th Annual Conference on Information Sciences and Systems (CISS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 46th Annual Conference on Information Sciences and Systems (CISS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6299180/6310704/06310714.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doi":"10.1109/CISS.2012.6310714","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CISS.2012.6310714","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6310704","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive channel estimation in decode and forward relay networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6310714/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 March 2012","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive channel estimation in decode and forward relay networks","htmlLink":"/document/6310714/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2012","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2012","accessionNumber":"13034711","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"21-23 March 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive channel estimation in decode and forward relay networks","confLoc":"Princeton, NJ, USA","sourcePdf":"100.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052302S","chronDate":"21-23 March 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6299180","isNumber":"6310704","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6299180","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6310704","articleId":"6310714","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6310717,"authors":[{"name":"Kianoush Hosseini","affiliation":["The Edward S.

However, the spatially random installation of FAPs and lack of coordination between the FAPs and cellular tiers results in co-channel interference which limit the system performance. This paper designs an interference avoidance scheme for cognitive femtocell networks based on a hierarchical architecture that exploits clustering. Each FAP senses the licensed spectrum to find \u201cblank spaces\u201d, measures its mutual similarity with only its neighboring FAPs, and forms simple messages which serve as incentives for active FAPs to partition into coalition clusters. Then, the chosen cluster head coordinates its members' transmissions. Cluster formation is updated on large time scales and is not susceptible to the instantaneous channel variations, thereby reducing the overhead in real-time communication. Our proposed scheme not only minimizes cross-tier interference, but also maximizes indoor data rates. Numerical results show that the proposed distributed scheme outperforms (centralized) spectral clustering algorithm for different number of FAPs.","doi":"10.1109/CISS.2012.6310717","publicationTitle":"2012 46th Annual Conference on Information Sciences and Systems (CISS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 46th Annual Conference on Information Sciences and Systems (CISS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6299180/6310704/06310717.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CISS.2012.6310717","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6310704","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed clustering and interference avoidance in cognitive femtocell networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6310717","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Distributed clustering and interference avoidance in cognitive femtocell networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 March 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6310717/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"21-23 March 2012","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2012","accessionNumber":"13034714","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6310717/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed clustering and interference avoidance in cognitive femtocell networks","confLoc":"Princeton, NJ, USA","sourcePdf":"106.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.096393S","chronDate":"21-23 March 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6299180","isNumber":"6310704","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6299180","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6310704","articleId":"6310717","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6310721,"authors":[{"name":"Anand Guruswamy","affiliation":["Lehigh University, Bethlehem, PA, US"],"firstName":"Anand","lastName":"Guruswamy","id":"38467148000"},{"name":"V.U.

Under this setting, we derive closed form expressions for the optimal Neyman-Pearson detector and the detector signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). It is also shown that for radars with widely separated antennas, orthogonal waveforms maximize detector SNR at high received SNRs.

Some recovery algorithms employ the signal sparsity model to enhance the compressive sensing performance. These algorithms generally incorporate the extra information with the recovery algorithm. In this paper, we propose to exploit the extra information to deliberately employ the direct sampling for the dense parts of a signal vector.

The aim is to automatically classify 14 different classes of cell lines including 7 classes of breast and 7 classes of liver cancer cells. Microscopic images containing irregular carcinoma cell patterns are represented by randomly selected subwindows which possibly correspond to foreground pixels. For each subwindow, a correlation descriptor utilizing the fractional unbalanced wavelet transform coefficients and several morphological attributes as pixel features is computed. Directionally selective textural features are preferred primarily because of their ability to characterize singularities at multiple orientations, which often arise in carcinoma cell lines. A Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier with Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel is employed for final classification. Over a dataset of 280 images, we achieved an accuracy of 88.2%, which outperforms the classical correlation based methods.","doi":"10.1109/CISS.2012.6310726","publicationTitle":"2012 46th Annual Conference on Information Sciences and Systems (CISS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 46th Annual Conference on Information Sciences and Systems (CISS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6299180/6310704/06310726.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CISS.2012.6310726","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6310704","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Carcinoma cell line discrimination in microscopic images using unbalanced wavelets","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6310726","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Carcinoma cell line discrimination in microscopic images using unbalanced wavelets","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 March 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6310726/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"21-23 March 2012","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2012","accessionNumber":"13034723","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6310726/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Carcinoma cell line discrimination in microscopic images using unbalanced wavelets","confLoc":"Princeton, NJ, USA","sourcePdf":"120.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052624S","chronDate":"21-23 March 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6299180","isNumber":"6310704","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6299180","xplore-issue":"6310704","articleId":"6310726","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6310727,"authors":[{"name":"Yang Liu","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, Lehigh University, Bethlehem, PA"],"firstName":"Yang","lastName":"Liu","id":"38240164400"},{"name":"Jing Li","affiliation":["Lehigh University, Bethlehem, PA, US"],"firstName":"Jing","lastName":"Li"},{"name":"Kai Xie","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, Lehigh University, Bethlehem, PA"],"firstName":"Kai","lastName":"Xie","id":"37285594300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-3140-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-3139-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-3138-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6310727","dbTime":"29 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":117},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Vectors","Detectors","Decoding","Reed-Solomon codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["BCH codes","channel coding","discrete cosine transforms","discrete Fourier transforms","diversity reception","linear codes","maximum likelihood detection","mean square error methods","OFDM modulation","Reed-Solomon codes","space-time codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["linear channel analysis","continuous code space","linear analog coding","linear analog matrices","space-time codes","modulation diversity","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","OFDM","mean square error","MSE","linear minimum mean square error","LMMSE detector","maximum likelihood detector","LMMSE detection","signal-to-noise ratio","unitary codes","discrete cosine transform codes","discrete Fourier codes","BCH analog codes","Reed-Solomon analog codes","DCT codes","DFT codes"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["unitary matrix","linear analog codes","lower bound","maximum likelihood","minimum mean square error"]}],"abstract":"Linear analog coding, or, transformation through linear analog matrices, exhibits interesting relation to space-time codes and modulation diversity, and finds useful application in orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM).

An optimal transmission policy maximizing the average rate within a finite time horizon is found for a given energy harvesting scenario. In contrast to previous results for optimal power allocations with energy harvesting transmitters, it is observed that storage losses encourage instantaneous consumption of harvested energy without storage for moderate harvest rates. It is also shown that this policy converges to the known constant power transmission policies when storage efficiency goes to unity. Based on the optimal offline policy, an online policy based on constant charging and discharging thresholds is proposed. The performance of the optimal offline and proposed online algorithms are simulated along with naive transmission policies, and the behavior of the algorithms for various storage efficiencies is discussed.","doi":"10.1109/CISS.2012.6310730","publicationTitle":"2012 46th Annual Conference on Information Sciences and Systems (CISS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 46th Annual Conference on Information Sciences and Systems (CISS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6299180/6310704/06310730.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CISS.2012.6310730","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6310704","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal power policy for energy harvesting transmitters with inefficient energy storage","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6310730","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Optimal power policy for energy harvesting transmitters with inefficient energy storage","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 March 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6310730/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"21-23 March 2012","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2012","accessionNumber":"13034727","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6310730/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal power policy for energy harvesting transmitters with inefficient energy storage","confLoc":"Princeton, NJ, USA","sourcePdf":"125.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052498S","chronDate":"21-23 March 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6299180","isNumber":"6310704","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6299180","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"6310704","articleId":"6310730","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":6310732,"authors":[{"name":"Virgilio Rodriguez","affiliation":["Communication Networks (ComNets) Research Group, RWTH Aachen, Aachen, Germany"],"firstName":"Virgilio","lastName":"Rodriguez","id":"37279118700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-3140-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-3139-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-3138-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6310732","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":59},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6310732","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cognitive radio","Information processing","Jamming","Sensors","Probabilistic logic","Economics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy limitations","sophisticated computing system","optimal probabilistic response","Shannon-theoretic mutual information","secondary dynamic spectrum access","inattentive cognitive radio information processing capacity"]}],"doi":"10.1109/CISS.2012.6310732","publicationTitle":"2012 46th Annual Conference on Information Sciences and Systems (CISS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 46th Annual Conference on Information Sciences and Systems (CISS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6299180/6310704/06310732.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CISS.2012.6310732","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6310704","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Inattentive cognitive radios: Cognition with information processing constraints","abstract":"A \u201ctrue\u201d cognitive radio is a sophisticated devise that is aware of, can adapt to, and even learn from its environment. To do so, such device would need to perform many complex (parallel) tasks in minuscule amounts of time, and within tight size, weight, heat, and energy limitations. In any sophisticated computing system, communication and computation limit each other. Here we discuss a formal model that abstract an information-processing limited rational entity (human or not) seeking to maximise a performance function that depends on both an action under its control, and and an exogenous input. The entity finds and optimal probabilistic response such that the Shannon-theoretic mutual information between input and output does not exceed an information capacity constraint. The possible application to secondary dynamic spectrum access receives special attention, but the framework is of interest whenever the practical limits on a cognitive radio information processing capacity cannot be neglected. Rather than proposing a particular algorithm and showing numerical results, our aims are to (i) introduce an important practical problem affecting \u201ctrue\u201d cognitive radios, (ii) introduce a body of existing scientific literature not widely known in engineering, and (iii) discuss potential applications of this literature to cognitive radio research.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 March 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6310732/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"13034729","publicationDate":"March 2012","conferenceDate":"21-23 March 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6310732/","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Inattentive cognitive radios: Cognition with information processing constraints","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Inattentive cognitive radios: Cognition with information processing constraints","confLoc":"Princeton, NJ, USA","sourcePdf":"127.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077828S","chronDate":"21-23 March 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6299180","isNumber":"6310704","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6299180","xplore-issue":"6310704","articleId":"6310732","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6310733,"authors":[{"name":"Felip Riera-Palou","affiliation":["Mobile Communications Group, University of the Balearic Islands, Illes Balears, Spain"],"firstName":"Felip","lastName":"Riera-Palou","id":"38276004600"},{"name":"Guillem Femenias","affiliation":["Mobile Communications Group, University of the Balearic Islands, Illes Balears, Spain"],"firstName":"Guillem","lastName":"Femenias","id":"37266545400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-3140-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-3139-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-3138-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6310733","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":84},"abstract":"Optimum detection based on maximum likelihood (ML) has been recently explored within the context of linearly precoded subcarrier cooperative MIMO-OFDM systems, showing that large performance gains can be obtained in comparison to an all-linear setup (i.e., linear transmitter/receiver) at the cost of increased computational complexity. Nonetheless, low complexity alternatives, yet retaining optimality, have been also proposed. Most of these previous works have assumed the availability of perfect channel state information at the transmitter (CSIT) despite this is rarely the case since feedback delay and/or quantisation effects will usually render imperfect CSIT. This paper studies how these imperfections affect the performance of the ML-based receiver. Particularly, it focuses on fully loaded setups, that is, those configurations where the number of independent streams transmitted equals the number of available spatial modes. Remarkably, for these configurations, an interesting interplay arises between the presence of CSIT imperfections, the spreading of the information symbols in the frequency and spatial domains and the diversity order achieved.","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 46th Annual Conference on Information Sciences and Systems (CISS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6299180/6310704/06310733.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2012 46th Annual Conference on Information Sciences and Systems (CISS)","doi":"10.1109/CISS.2012.6310733","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CISS.2012.6310733","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6310704","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6310733","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On optimal detection for linearly precoded MIMO-OFDM systems with imperfect CSIT","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resource management","Next generation networking"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cooperative communication","linear codes","maximum likelihood estimation","MIMO communication","OFDM modulation","precoding","radio receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimal detection","CSIT","maximum likelihood","linearly precoded subcarrier cooperative MIMO-OFDM systems","computational complexity","channel state information at the transmitter","CSIT","feedback delay","ML-based receiver","spatial modes"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6310733/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 March 2012","displayDocTitle":"On optimal detection for linearly precoded MIMO-OFDM systems with imperfect CSIT","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6310733/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2012","accessionNumber":"13034730","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2012","conferenceDate":"21-23 March 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On optimal detection for linearly precoded MIMO-OFDM systems with imperfect CSIT","confLoc":"Princeton, NJ, USA","sourcePdf":"128.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056024S","chronDate":"21-23 March 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6299180","isNumber":"6310704","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6299180","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6310704","articleId":"6310733","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6310736,"authors":[{"name":"Kai Xie","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, Lehigh University, Bethlehem, PA"],"firstName":"Kai","lastName":"Xie","id":"37285594300"},{"name":"Jing Li","affiliation":["Lehigh University, Bethlehem, PA, US"],"firstName":"Jing","lastName":"Li"},{"name":"Yang Liu","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, Lehigh University, Bethlehem, PA"],"firstName":"Yang","lastName":"Liu","id":"38240164400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-3140-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-3139-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-3138-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6310736","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":218},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Block codes","Hamming distance","Finite element methods","Measurement","Generators","Vectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error correction codes","linear codes","mean square error methods","nonlinear codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["real-/complex-valued source data mapping","real-/complex-valued codeword","digital error correction code","linear analog error correction coding","minimum squared Euclidean distance ratio","minimum distance ratio","mean square error","MSE performance","maximum squared Euclidean distance ratio expansible","MDRE","code design","MDS","distance metrics","unitary code","nonlinear analog code"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["analog error correction","maximum distance separable","maximum likelihood","maximum distance ratio expansible"]}],"abstract":"Analog error correction codes, by mapping real-/complex-valued source data to real-/complex-valued codewords, present generalization of the conventional digital error correction codes. This paper studies the theory of linear analog error correction coding. Since classical concepts of minimum Hamming distance and minimum Euclidean distance fail in the analog context, a new metric, termed the \u201cminimum (squared Euclidean) distance ratio,\u201d is defined. It is shown that the linear analog code that achieves the biggest possible minimum distance ratio also achieves the smallest possible mean square error (MSE) performance. Based on this achievability, a concept of \u201cmaximum (squared Euclidean) distance ratio expansible (MDRE)\u201d is established for analog codes, similar in spirit to \u201cmaximum distance separable (MDS)\u201d for digital codes. Code design and analysis reveal that the criteria of MDRE and MDS, although evaluated against different distance metrics, need not conflict each other, but can be effectively unified in the same code design. It is shown that unitary codes are best linear analog codes that simultaneously achieves MDRE and MDS; at the same time, however, nonlinear analog codes appear to outperform the best linear analog codes.","publicationTitle":"2012 46th Annual Conference on Information Sciences and Systems (CISS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 46th Annual Conference on Information Sciences and Systems (CISS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6299180/6310704/06310736.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Linear analog codes: The good and the bad","doi":"10.1109/CISS.2012.6310736","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6310704","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CISS.2012.6310736","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6310736","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6310736/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 March 2012","displayDocTitle":"Linear analog codes: The good and the bad","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2012","publicationDate":"March 2012","accessionNumber":"13034733","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"21-23 March 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6310736/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Linear analog codes: The good and the bad","confLoc":"Princeton, NJ, USA","sourcePdf":"132.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073943S","chronDate":"21-23 March 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6299180","isNumber":"6310704","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6299180","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6310704","articleId":"6310736","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6310741,"authors":[{"name":"Abdullah Cay","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Old Dominion University, Norfolk, VA, 23529"],"firstName":"Abdullah","lastName":"Cay","id":"37449566700"},{"name":"Dimitrie C.

The game is between the jammer and the transmitter. We formulate their interaction as a two-player, zero-sum game. The jammer is assumed to be a Gaussian pulse-noise jammer with a fixed average power. A Jammer's strategy consists of choosing a duty factor such that transmitter's payoff is minimized. We consider a transmitter that has two possible options to communicate with the receiver; the transmitter can use a \u201clow-rate code\u201d which can be recovered at the receiver regardless of the jammer's activity, or he can use a \u201chigh-rate code\u201d that will be lost if the jammer is active. We study two scenarios in which transmitter uses the codes in different manners; in the first scenario, the transmitter uses one code at a time with a duty factor (or probability) while in the second scenario, he superimposes the high-rate code over the low-rate code and transmits both codes simultaneously. We study these two scenarios against the jammer's strategy and identify a mixed-strategy Nash equilibrium and the game value for both cases. We show that superposition coding can achieve a higher payoff to the transmitter than the first scenario.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Jamming","Games","Receivers","Radio transmitters","Game theory","Encoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["codes","game theory","Gaussian noise","jamming","probability","radio receivers","radio transmitters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["jamming games","multirate superposition coding transmitter","communicating node","game theoretic framework","two-player zero-sum game","Gaussian pulse-noise jammer","jammer strategy","low-rate code","high-rate code","duty factor","probability","Nash equilibrium","game value"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Superposition Coding","Game Theory","Jamming"]}],"doi":"10.1109/CISS.2012.6310744","publicationTitle":"2012 46th Annual Conference on Information Sciences and Systems (CISS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 46th Annual Conference on Information Sciences and Systems (CISS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6299180/6310704/06310744.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6310704","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CISS.2012.6310744","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Jamming games against multi-rate superposition coding transmitters","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6310744","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Jamming games against multi-rate superposition coding transmitters","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6310744/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6310744/","accessionNumber":"13034741","conferenceDate":"21-23 March 2012","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 March 2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Jamming games against multi-rate superposition coding transmitters","confLoc":"Princeton, NJ, USA","sourcePdf":"140.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047058S","chronDate":"21-23 March 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6299180","isNumber":"6310704","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6299180","xplore-issue":"6310704","articleId":"6310744","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6310745,"authors":[{"name":"Yueqian Li","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Northeastern University, Boston, MA"],"lastName":"Yueqian Li","id":"37310404200"},{"name":"Masoud Salehi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Northeastern University, Boston, MA"],"firstName":"Masoud","lastName":"Salehi","id":"37300562800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-3140-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-3139-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-3138-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6310745","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":170},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Space-time codes","Fading","Decoding","Modulation","Complexity theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel coding","fading channels","MIMO communication","modulation","space division multiplexing","space-time codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["coded MIMO systems","modulation diversity","block-fading channels","multiple-input multiple-output scheme","spatial multiplexing","full diversity","transmit antennas","receive antennas","channel code","space-time code","time diversity","space diversity","processing complexity"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Block-fading channels","multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)","space-time coding","modulation diversity","sphere decoder"]}],"abstract":"We propose a new coded multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) scheme based on modulation diversity technique for block-fading channels.

In this paper, we consider secondary spectrum trading between one seller (i.e., the primary spectrum owner, PO) and multiple buyers (i.e., the secondary users, SUs) in a hybrid spectrum market with both guaranteed contract buyers (future market) and spot purchasing buyers (spot market).We focus on the PO's profit maximization with stochastic network information, and formulate the PO's expected profit maximization problem, where the optimal solution serves as a policy guiding the allocation of every spectrum under every possible information realization. We study systematically the optimal solutions under both information symmetry and information asymmetry, depending on whether the PO can observe the SUs' realized information. Under information symmetry, we show that the optimal solution (benchmark) maximizes both the PO's expected profit (optimality) and the social welfare (efficiency). Under information asymmetry, an incentive-compatible mechanism is necessary for eliciting the SUs' realized information. We propose the ContrAuction, an integrated contract and auction design, where the PO acts as virtual bidders (in addition to the role of an auctioneer) on behalf of the guaranteed contracts. We derive the optimal ContrAuction under the constraint of efficiency, and characterize the PO's expected profit loss (compared to that under information symmetry) induced by the information rent for the SUs.","doi":"10.1109/CISS.2012.6310751","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 46th Annual Conference on Information Sciences and Systems (CISS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6299180/6310704/06310751.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6310704","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CISS.2012.6310751","publicationTitle":"2012 46th Annual Conference on Information Sciences and Systems (CISS)","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"ContrAuction: An integrated contract and auction design for dynamic spectrum sharing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6310751","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 March 2012","displayDocTitle":"ContrAuction: An integrated contract and auction design for dynamic spectrum sharing","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6310751/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6310751/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2012","accessionNumber":"13034748","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2012","conferenceDate":"21-23 March 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"ContrAuction: An integrated contract and auction design for dynamic spectrum sharing","confLoc":"Princeton, NJ, USA","sourcePdf":"152.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072441S","chronDate":"21-23 March 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6299180","isNumber":"6310704","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6299180","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6310704","articleId":"6310751","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6310766,"authors":[{"name":"Nidhi Hegde","affiliation":["Technicolor, Paris Research Lab, France"],"firstName":"Nidhi","lastName":"Hegde","id":"37297867600"},{"name":"Alexandre Prouti\u00e8re","affiliation":["Kungliga Tekniska Hogskolan, Stockholm, SE"],"firstName":"Alexandre","lastName":"Prouti\u00e8re"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-3140-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-3139-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-3138-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6310766","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":229},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel allocation","Convergence","Approximation algorithms","Algorithm design and analysis","Heuristic algorithms","Throughput","Resource management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["carrier sense multiple access","Markov processes","Monte Carlo methods","optimisation","scheduling","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["simulation-based optimization algorithms","dynamic spectrum access","wireless systems","unlicensed part","radio spectrum","WiFi","frequency bands","decentralized manner","decentralized protocols","utility-optimal allocations","spectrum resources","optimal static channel allocation","channel assignment problem","optimal algorithms","reversible Monte Carlo Markov chain","MCMC methods","channel selection algorithms","scheduling","CSMA protocols","op- timal decentralized scheduling","channel selection algorithms"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6310766","doi":"10.1109/CISS.2012.6310766","publicationTitle":"2012 46th Annual Conference on Information Sciences and Systems (CISS)","abstract":"Wireless systems operating on the unlicensed part of the radio spectrum (e.g. WiFi and their evolutions) must share a (potentially large) number of frequency bands or channels in a decentralized manner.

In this paper, we propose and analyze decentralized protocols that aim at achieving utility-optimal allocations of spectrum resources. We first address the problem of finding an optimal static channel allocation (a classical channel assignment problem). We illustrate how optimal algorithms based on simple reversible Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) methods can be designed. We also evaluate the mixing time of these algorithms. We then consider scenarios where scheduling and channel selection algorithms operate at the same time-scale and have to be designed jointly. We formulate the corresponding optimization problem and combine CSMA protocols and MCMC methods to devise optimal decentralized scheduling and channel selection algorithms. The proposed algorithms differ from existing algorithms as they mimic centralized steepest coordinate ascent methods, yielding faster convergence.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CISS.2012.6310766","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6310704","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 46th Annual Conference on Information Sciences and Systems (CISS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6299180/6310704/06310766.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Simulation-based optimization algorithms with applications to dynamic spectrum access","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6310766/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 March 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6310766/","displayDocTitle":"Simulation-based optimization algorithms with applications to dynamic spectrum access","conferenceDate":"21-23 March 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2012","accessionNumber":"13034763","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Simulation-based optimization algorithms with applications to dynamic spectrum access","confLoc":"Princeton, NJ, USA","sourcePdf":"169.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059066S","chronDate":"21-23 March 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6299180","isNumber":"6310704","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6299180","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"6310704","articleId":"6310766","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6310767,"authors":[{"name":"Anand D.

This work falls in the framework of consensus or gossip algorithms - individuals have local observations of a global phenomenon and wish to estimate a global quantity through synchronous (consensus) or asynchronous (gossip) protocols. Our approach departs from consensus-based models of communication by using a message model based on the exchange of randomly selected messages. In most cases these messages are much simpler to transmit than the full state information required by a consensus protocols. In other words, agents collect information and form beliefs via sampling: agents take local (noisy) samples of the global phenomenon of interest and social samples from the belief neighbors in the network. We propose an appropriate analytic framework and provide examples to demonstrate how social sampling can enable social learning.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6310704","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CISS.2012.6310767","publicationTitle":"2012 46th Annual Conference on Information Sciences and Systems (CISS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 46th Annual Conference on Information Sciences and Systems (CISS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6299180/6310704/06310767.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doi":"10.1109/CISS.2012.6310767","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed learning from social sampling","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 March 2012","displayDocTitle":"Distributed learning from social sampling","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"21-23 March 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6310767/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2012","accessionNumber":"13034764","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6310767/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed learning from social sampling","confLoc":"Princeton, NJ, USA","sourcePdf":"170.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.089349S","chronDate":"21-23 March 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6299180","isNumber":"6310704","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6299180","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6310704","articleId":"6310767","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6310768,"authors":[{"name":"Vincent Y.

For the Slepian-Wolf problem (distributed lossless source coding), we introduce a fundamental quantity known as the entropy dispersion matrix. We show that if this matrix is positive-definite, the optimal rate region under the constraint of a fixed blocklength and non-zero error probability has a curved boundary compared to being polyhedral for the asymptotic Slepian-Wolf scenario. In addition, the entropy dispersion matrix governs the rate of convergence of the non-asymptotic region to the asymptotic one. We develop a general universal achievability procedure for finite blocklength analyses of other network information theory problems such as the multiple-access channel and broadcast channel. We provide inner bounds to these problems using a key result known as the vector rate redundancy theorem which is proved using a multidimensional version of the Berry-Ess\u00e8en theorem. We show that a so-called information dispersion matrix characterizes these inner bounds.","doi":"10.1109/CISS.2012.6310768","publicationTitle":"2012 46th Annual Conference on Information Sciences and Systems (CISS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 46th Annual Conference on Information Sciences and Systems (CISS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6299180/6310704/06310768.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CISS.2012.6310768","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6310704","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the dispersions of three network information theory problems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6310768","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 March 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6310768/","displayDocTitle":"On the dispersions of three network information theory problems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2012","accessionNumber":"13034765","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6310768/","conferenceDate":"21-23 March 2012","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the dispersions of three network information theory problems","confLoc":"Princeton, NJ, USA","sourcePdf":"171.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.089397S","chronDate":"21-23 March 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6299180","isNumber":"6310704","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6299180","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"6310704","articleId":"6310768","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-28"},{"_id":6310769,"authors":[{"name":"A.

In this paper, we formulate a sequentially-adaptive algorithm for training a complex baseband predistorter that minimizes mean-square-error between the complex input signal and the eventual amplifier output.

Often, however, the convergence threshold is optimized based on the general LDPC code ensemble (i.e., the degree profile only) without taking into account the imposed structure, leading to a mismatch of anticipated and actual threshold performance. In this paper, we study this mismatch in more detail and restrict ourselves to the simplest yet most popular constraint: the dual-diagonal structure of the parity-check matrix of a repeat-accumulate code, enabling linear-time encoding. We show that convergence threshold predictions based on density evolution (DE) or EXIT charts need an appropriate choice of component code models. We quantify the threshold prediction error for both BEC and AWGN channels over a wide range of code rates and degree profile optimization techniques. Finally, we provide an explicit example illustrating the achievable gains by using properly designed degree profiles.","publicationTitle":"2012 46th Annual Conference on Information Sciences and Systems (CISS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 46th Annual Conference on Information Sciences and Systems (CISS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6299180/6310704/06310800.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On threshold prediction of low-density parity-check codes with structure","doi":"10.1109/CISS.2012.6310800","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6310704","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CISS.2012.6310800","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6310800","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6310800/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 March 2012","displayDocTitle":"On threshold prediction of low-density parity-check codes with structure","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2012","publicationDate":"March 2012","accessionNumber":"13034788","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"21-23 March 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6310800/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On threshold prediction of low-density parity-check codes with structure","confLoc":"Princeton, NJ, USA","sourcePdf":"27.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069576S","chronDate":"21-23 March 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6299180","isNumber":"6310704","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6299180","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6310704","articleId":"6310800","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6310809,"authors":[{"name":"Chunxuan Ye","affiliation":["InterDigital Communications, LLC., King of Prussia, PA"],"firstName":"Chunxuan","lastName":"Ye","id":"37278732800"},{"name":"Alpaslan Demir","affiliation":["InterDigital Communications, LLC., 781 Third Ave, King of Prussia, PA 19406, USA"],"firstName":"Alpaslan","lastName":"Demir"},{"name":"Yan Li","affiliation":["InterDigital Communications, LLC., King of Prussia, PA"],"firstName":"Yan","lastName":"Li","id":"37086763580"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-3140-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-3139-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-3138-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6310809","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":67},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6310809","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Signal to noise ratio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","energy conservation","fading channels","sensor fusion","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["preliminary performance evaluation","sensor network","intermediate fusion helper","cognitive radios","binary decision","data fusion center","wireless fading channel","energy inefficiency","spectral inefficiency","traffic load"]}],"doi":"10.1109/CISS.2012.6310809","publicationTitle":"2012 46th Annual Conference on Information Sciences and Systems (CISS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 46th Annual Conference on Information Sciences and Systems (CISS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6299180/6310704/06310809.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CISS.2012.6310809","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6310704","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Preliminary performance evaluation of sensor network with intermediate fusion helper for cognitive radios","abstract":"In this paper, we consider the problem of using three sensors to detect whether a certain spectrum is occupied or not. Each sensor sends its binary decision to the data fusion center through a wireless fading channel. The data fusion center combines the outcomes for an overall decision. Our analysis shows that a basic sensor network does not result in a high enough correct probability of the overall decision when the wireless fading channels experience low SNR. Then, we observe that this probability could be significantly increased with the deployment of relays in the network. However, a sensor network with relays still suffers from energy and spectral inefficiency. The sensor network with an intermediate fusion helper was recently proposed to reduce the traffic load at the data fusion center. We examine the correct probability of the overall decision resulting from a sensor network with an intermediate fusion helper. Our evaluation establishes that a sensor network with an intermediate fusion helper performs almost as good as the sensor network with relays, but with energy and spectral advantages.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 March 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6310809/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"13034797","publicationDate":"March 2012","conferenceDate":"21-23 March 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6310809/","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Preliminary performance evaluation of sensor network with intermediate fusion helper for cognitive radios","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Preliminary performance evaluation of sensor network with intermediate fusion helper for cognitive radios","confLoc":"Princeton, NJ, USA","sourcePdf":"38.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057819S","chronDate":"21-23 March 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6299180","isNumber":"6310704","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6299180","xplore-issue":"6310704","articleId":"6310809","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6310811,"authors":[{"name":"Yuewen Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University Heights, Newark, USA"],"lastName":"Yuewen Wang","id":"37087351361"},{"name":"Ali N.

We assumed encoding is performed by an erasure-filling decoder and are interested in minimizing encoding time, subject to maintaining good error performance in decoding. We focus on a design parameter, called the recovery vector n, which controls the encoding speed of EE codes. When designing powerful block codes, this vector affords great flexibility in setting the encoding speed. Both analytic and simulation results indicate that faster encoding speed eventually implies a degraded error floor performance, and in practice the tradeoff between encoding speed and error floor performance should be evaluated to meet the actual application. In addition, an extra design rule is proposed for EE low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes, and we show that the popular irregular repeat accumulate (IRA) codes and efficiently-encodable rate-compatible (EERC) codes can be obtained by using such rule.","doi":"10.1109/CISS.2012.6310815","publicationTitle":"2012 46th Annual Conference on Information Sciences and Systems (CISS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 46th Annual Conference on Information Sciences and Systems (CISS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6299180/6310704/06310815.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6310704","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CISS.2012.6310815","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance of efficiently-encodable iteratively-decodable block codes","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6310815","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 March 2012","displayDocTitle":"Performance of efficiently-encodable iteratively-decodable block codes","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6310815/","publicationDate":"March 2012","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2012","accessionNumber":"13034803","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6310815/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"21-23 March 2012","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance of efficiently-encodable iteratively-decodable block codes","confLoc":"Princeton, NJ, USA","sourcePdf":"44.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06507S","chronDate":"21-23 March 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6299180","isNumber":"6310704","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6299180","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6310704","articleId":"6310815","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6310816,"authors":[{"name":"Fabio Iannello","affiliation":["CWCSPR, New Jersey Institute of Technology, Newark, New Jersey, USA"],"firstName":"Fabio","lastName":"Iannello","id":"37317492300"},{"name":"Osvaldo Simeone","affiliation":["CWCSPR, New Jersey Institute of Technology, Newark, New Jersey, USA"],"firstName":"Osvaldo","lastName":"Simeone","id":"37269653500"},{"name":"Umberto Spagnolini","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Elettronica e Informazione, Politecnico di Milano, Milan, Italy"],"firstName":"Umberto","lastName":"Spagnolini","id":"37269649600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-3140-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-3139-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-3138-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6310816","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":17,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":288},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy harvesting","Markov processes","scheduling","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["myopic scheduling optimality","single-hop wireless sensor network","M energy harvesting-capable sensors","FC","K orthogonal communication resources","energy harvesting-discharging process","EH","partially observable Markov decision processes","POMDP","restless multi-armed bandit framework","RMAB framework","Whittle index policy"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6310816","abstract":"Consider a single-hop wireless sensor network, where a central node (or fusion center, FC) collects data from a set of M energy harvesting (EH)-capable sensors (or nodes). In each time-slot only a subset of K \u2264 M nodes can be scheduled by the FC for transmission over K orthogonal communication resources (e.g., frequencies). The scheduling problem is tackled by assuming that the FC has no direct access to the instantaneous states of the nodes' batteries, but it only knows the outcomes of previous transmissions attempts and the statistical properties of the energy harvesting/discharging processes. Based on a simple Markovian modeling of the EH and battery leakage processes, the FC's scheduling problem is formulated as partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) and then cast into a restless multi-armed bandit (RMAB) framework. It is shown that in some special cases, a myopic (or greedy) scheduling policy is optimal, and that such a policy coincides with the so called Whittle index policy.","doi":"10.1109/CISS.2012.6310816","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CISS.2012.6310816","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 46th Annual Conference on Information Sciences and Systems (CISS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6299180/6310704/06310816.pdf","publicationTitle":"2012 46th Annual Conference on Information Sciences and Systems (CISS)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6310704","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimality of myopic scheduling and whittle indexability for energy harvesting sensors","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 March 2012","displayDocTitle":"Optimality of myopic scheduling and whittle indexability for energy harvesting sensors","conferenceDate":"21-23 March 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2012","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2012","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6310816/","accessionNumber":"13034804","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6310816/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimality of myopic scheduling and whittle indexability for energy harvesting sensors","confLoc":"Princeton, NJ, USA","sourcePdf":"45.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059506S","chronDate":"21-23 March 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6299180","isNumber":"6310704","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6299180","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"6310704","articleId":"6310816","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6310817,"authors":[{"name":"Jan Oksanen","affiliation":["SMARAD CoE, Aalto University, Finland"],"firstName":"Jan","lastName":"Oksanen","id":"37410241600"},{"name":"Jarmo Lund\u00e9n","affiliation":["SMARAD CoE, Aalto University, Finland"],"firstName":"Jarmo","lastName":"Lund\u00e9n","id":"37304324400"},{"name":"Visa Koivunen","affiliation":["SMARAD CoE, Aalto University, Finland"],"firstName":"Visa","lastName":"Koivunen","id":"37269798700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-3140-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-3139-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-3138-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6310817","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":205},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sensors","Learning systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","combinatorial mathematics","learning (artificial intelligence)","multi-access systems","probability","radio networks","search problems","telecommunication computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimal spectrum sensing policy design","multiuser multiband cognitive radio network","combinatorial problem","nonparametric reinforcement learning-based method","multiband radio spectrum","suboptimal sensing policy search algorithm","multiuser multiband access policy","randomized Chair-Varshney rule","probability of false alarms","probability of detection"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cognitive radio","sensing policy","reinforcement learning"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6310817","doi":"10.1109/CISS.2012.6310817","publicationTitle":"2012 46th Annual Conference on Information Sciences and Systems (CISS)","abstract":"Finding an optimal sensing policy for a particular access policy and sensing scheme is a laborious combinatorial problem that requires the system model parameters to be known.

Unlike pure distributed beamforming, where the ith transmit coefficient depends only on the ith transmit node's channel to the intended receiver, the transmit coefficients of a distributed nullformer each depend on the channel responses from all of the transmit nodes to all of the protected nodes. The requirement for each transmit node to know all of the channels in the system makes distributed transmit nullforming challenging to implement in the presence of channel time variations. This paper describes a receiver-coordinated distributed transmission protocol, in the context of a state-space dynamic channel model, in which the receive nodes feed back periodic channel measurements to the transmit cluster. The transmit nodes use this feedback to generate optimal channel predictions and then calculate a time-varying transmit vector that minimizes the average total power at the protected receivers while satisfying an average power constraint at the intended receiver during distributed transmission. We demonstrate via analysis and numerical simulation the efficacy of the technique even with low channel measurement overhead, infrequent update intervals, and significant feedback latency.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CISS.2012.6310822","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6310704","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 46th Annual Conference on Information Sciences and Systems (CISS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6299180/6310704/06310822.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Receiver-coordinated distributed transmit nullforming with channel state uncertainty","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6310822/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 March 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6310822/","displayDocTitle":"Receiver-coordinated distributed transmit nullforming with channel state uncertainty","conferenceDate":"21-23 March 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2012","accessionNumber":"13034810","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Receiver-coordinated distributed transmit nullforming with channel state uncertainty","confLoc":"Princeton, NJ, USA","sourcePdf":"52.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071055S","chronDate":"21-23 March 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6299180","isNumber":"6310704","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6299180","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"6310704","articleId":"6310822","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6310825,"authors":[{"name":"Sachin Chaudhari","affiliation":["SMARAD CoE, Aalto University School of Electrical Engineering, Finland"],"firstName":"Sachin","lastName":"Chaudhari","id":"37409477600"},{"name":"Jarmo Lund\u00e9n","affiliation":["SMARAD CoE, Aalto University School of Electrical Engineering, Finland"],"firstName":"Jarmo","lastName":"Lund\u00e9n","id":"37304324400"},{"name":"Visa Koivunen","affiliation":["SMARAD CoE, Aalto University School of Electrical Engineering, Finland"],"firstName":"Visa","lastName":"Koivunen","id":"37269798700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-3140-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-3139-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-3138-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6310825","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":162},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Zinc","Quantization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","decision making","error statistics","quantisation (signal)","radio spectrum management","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sequential detection quantization","sequential detection channel errors","cognitive radios","SD scheme","cooperative spectrum sensing","distributed parallel detection network","local log-likelihood ratios","LLR","sequential decision","quantized local LLR","erroneous reporting channels","binary symmetric channels","BSC","bit error probability","BEP","average sample number","ASN","fixed sample size test","unquantized FSS test"]}],"abstract":"This paper studies the impact of quantization and reporting channel errors on the performance of a sequential detection (SD) scheme for cooperative spectrum sensing in cognitive radios. The analyzed system model is a distributed parallel detection network in which the sensors quantize their local log-likelihood ratios (LLRs) and transmit them to the FC which makes the decision sequentially. The quantized local LLRs are transmitted through erroneous reporting channels. These reporting channels are modeled as binary symmetric channels (BSCs) that cause errors with a certain bit error probability (BEP). The quantization and reporting channel errors are shown to increase the average sample number (ASN) of the SD. Later the performances of the SD and fixed sample size (FSS) test are compared to show the superiority of the SD over the FSS test even in the presence of quantization and reporting channel errors regardless of the BEP. Even the ASN of the SD with 1-bit quantization is shown to be smaller than the ASN of an unquantized FSS test with the same error probabilities in the considered scenario.","doi":"10.1109/CISS.2012.6310825","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 46th Annual Conference on Information Sciences and Systems (CISS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6299180/6310704/06310825.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6310704","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CISS.2012.6310825","publicationTitle":"2012 46th Annual Conference on Information Sciences and Systems (CISS)","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Effects of quantization and channel errors on sequential detection in cognitive radios","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6310825","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 March 2012","displayDocTitle":"Effects of quantization and channel errors on sequential detection in cognitive radios","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6310825/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6310825/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2012","accessionNumber":"13034813","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2012","conferenceDate":"21-23 March 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Effects of quantization and channel errors on sequential detection in cognitive radios","confLoc":"Princeton, NJ, USA","sourcePdf":"55.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.126422S","chronDate":"21-23 March 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6299180","isNumber":"6310704","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6299180","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6310704","articleId":"6310825","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6310826,"authors":[{"name":"Fan Sun","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Systems, Aalborg University, Aalborg, Denmark"],"lastName":"Fan Sun","id":"37598019900"},{"name":"Elisabeth de Carvalho","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Systems, Aalborg University, Aalborg, Denmark"],"firstName":"Elisabeth","lastName":"de Carvalho","id":"37293743600"},{"name":"Chan Dai Truyen Thai","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Systems, Faculty of Engineering and Science, Aalborg University, DK-9220, Denmark"],"firstName":"Chan Dai Truyen","lastName":"Thai"},{"name":"Petar Popovski","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Systems, Aalborg University, Aalborg, Denmark"],"firstName":"Petar","lastName":"Popovski","id":"37281987200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-3140-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-3139-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-3138-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6310826","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":132},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Array signal processing","Wireless communication","Signal to noise ratio","Interference","Annealing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplify and forward communication","array signal processing","network coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["beamforming design","coordinated direct systems","relay systems","joint processing","multiple communication flows","wireless systems","transmission techniques","two-way relaying","wireless network coding","coordinated direct and relay transmissions","CDR transmissions","traffic flow constellation","traffic flows","amplify-and-forward","multiple antennas","downlink users","beamforming criteria","egoistic","altruistic","sum-rate maximization","sum-rate criterion","nonconvex problem","iterative solution"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cooperative transmission","amplify-and-forward","beamforming","a priori information"]}],"abstract":"Joint processing of multiple communication flows in wireless systems has given rise to a number of novel transmission techniques, notably the two-way relaying based on wireless network coding. Recently, a related set of techniques has emerged, termed coordinated direct and relay (CDR) transmissions, where the constellation of traffic flows is more general than the two-way. Regardless of the actual traffic flows, in a CDR scheme the relay has a central role in managing the interference. In this paper we investigate the novel transmission modes, based on amplify-and-forward, that arise when the relay is equipped with multiple antennas and can use beamforming. We focus on one representative traffic type, with two downlink users and consider three different beamforming criteria: egoistic, altruistic, and sum-rate maximization. The sum-rate criterion leads to a non-convex problem and we introduce an iterative solution, as well as derive an upper performance bound. The numerical results demonstrate a clear benefit from usage of multiple antennas at the relay node.","doi":"10.1109/CISS.2012.6310826","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 46th Annual Conference on Information Sciences and Systems (CISS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6299180/6310704/06310826.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6310704","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CISS.2012.6310826","publicationTitle":"2012 46th Annual Conference on Information Sciences and Systems (CISS)","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Beamforming design for coordinated direct and relay systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6310826","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 March 2012","displayDocTitle":"Beamforming design for coordinated direct and relay systems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6310826/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6310826/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2012","accessionNumber":"13034814","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2012","conferenceDate":"21-23 March 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Beamforming design for coordinated direct and relay systems","confLoc":"Princeton, NJ, USA","sourcePdf":"56.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05313S","chronDate":"21-23 March 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6299180","isNumber":"6310704","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6299180","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6310704","articleId":"6310826","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6310827,"authors":[{"name":"Dusadee Treeumnuk","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Old Dominion University, Norfolk, VA, USA"],"firstName":"Dusadee","lastName":"Treeumnuk","id":"37681915400"},{"name":"Dimitrie C.

Due to its simplicity, energy detection is a main approach to identify spectrum opportunities in CR systems. However, the performance of energy-based spectrum sensing depends on accurate estimation of the noise energy which is required to determine the optimal sensing threshold that implies desired values for the probabilities of detection and false alarm. In this paper we study the use of Hidden Markov Models (HMM) to describe the output of energy detectors used for spectrum sensing in CR systems, and we present a novel approach that enables performance awareness and noise variance estimation for the energy detector. The proposed approach uses the values of the probabilities of detection and false alarm estimated from the HMM output to determine when the detector performance degrades due to changes in noise variance and to estimate the new variance value. Numerical results obtained from simulations are presented to illustrate application of the proposed approach.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6310827/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 March 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2012","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2012","accessionNumber":"13034815","htmlLink":"/document/6310827/","conferenceDate":"21-23 March 2012","displayDocTitle":"Using Hidden Markov Models to enable performance awareness and noise variance estimation for energy detection in cognitive radio","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Using Hidden Markov Models to enable performance awareness and noise variance estimation for energy detection in cognitive radio","confLoc":"Princeton, NJ, USA","sourcePdf":"57.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055992S","chronDate":"21-23 March 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6299180","isNumber":"6310704","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6299180","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6310704","articleId":"6310827","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6310828,"authors":[{"name":"Yichao Huang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA"],"firstName":"Yichao","lastName":"Huang","id":"38065540400"},{"name":"Bhaskar D.

In practical systems with finite M and heterogeneous users having diverse large scale channel effects, in order to guarantee fairness among users and exploit multiuser diversity as well, an alternate scheduling policy is needed. In this paper, we leverage the cumulative distribution function based scheduling policy to achieve the two desired requirements and carry out both exact analysis and asymptotic analysis for systems employing random beamforming. The closed form sum rate with heterogeneous users is first derived by a recently proposed probability density function decomposition. We study individual scaling laws to examine the rate scaling for each individual user. Furthermore, asymptotic (in users) rate approximation is derived which tracks the exact performance well for small number of users.","doi":"10.1109/CISS.2012.6310828","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 46th Annual Conference on Information Sciences and Systems (CISS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6299180/6310704/06310828.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6310704","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CISS.2012.6310828","publicationTitle":"2012 46th Annual Conference on Information Sciences and Systems (CISS)","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance analysis of random beamforming with heterogeneous users","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6310828","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 March 2012","displayDocTitle":"Performance analysis of random beamforming with heterogeneous users","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6310828/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6310828/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2012","accessionNumber":"13034816","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2012","conferenceDate":"21-23 March 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance analysis of random beamforming with heterogeneous users","confLoc":"Princeton, NJ, USA","sourcePdf":"58.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.114948S","chronDate":"21-23 March 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6299180","isNumber":"6310704","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6299180","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6310704","articleId":"6310828","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6310829,"authors":[{"name":"Richard E.

Anomaly-based techniques to classify logins as fraudulent or legitimate have been proposed and used successfully, however the lack of clear mathematical structure in the space of IP addresses means that many of these methods require significant supplemental information such as payload, failed token usages, or user activity upon the secured network in order to achieve accurate detection rates. When this additional information is not available, such as in network-based intrusion detection systems, many systems to detect fraudulent security token usage require a series of usages before a classification can be made. We present an anomaly detection system based upon IP addresses, a mapping of geographic location as inferred from IP address, and usage timestamps that is capable of identifying fraudulent token usage with as little as a single instance of fraudulent usage while overcoming the often significant limitations in geographic IP address mappings.","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 46th Annual Conference on Information Sciences and Systems (CISS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6299180/6310704/06310829.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2012 46th Annual Conference on Information Sciences and Systems (CISS)","doi":"10.1109/CISS.2012.6310829","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CISS.2012.6310829","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6310704","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6310829","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Identification of anomalous network security token usage via clustering and density estimation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Geology","IP networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer network security","IP networks","pattern clustering","token networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["anomalous network security token usage identification","clustering estimation","density estimation","mathematical strncture","IP address","geographic location","geographic IP address mapping"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6310829/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 March 2012","displayDocTitle":"Identification of anomalous network security token usage via clustering and density estimation","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6310829/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2012","accessionNumber":"13034817","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2012","conferenceDate":"21-23 March 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Identification of anomalous network security token usage via clustering and density estimation","confLoc":"Princeton, NJ, USA","sourcePdf":"59.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.153704S","chronDate":"21-23 March 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6299180","isNumber":"6310704","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6299180","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6310704","articleId":"6310829","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6310830,"authors":[{"name":"Ankita Panwar","affiliation":["Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur, India"],"firstName":"Ankita","lastName":"Panwar","id":"37086204159"},{"name":"Piyush Bhardwaj","affiliation":["Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur, India"],"firstName":"Piyush","lastName":"Bhardwaj","id":"37086175855"},{"name":"Onur Ozdemir","affiliation":["ANDRO Computational Solutions, LLC, Rome, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Onur","lastName":"Ozdemir","id":"37285612700"},{"name":"Engin Masazade","affiliation":["Department of EECS, Syracuse University, Syracuse, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Engin","lastName":"Masazade","id":"38477850700"},{"name":"Chilukuri K.

We first show that these problems are NP-hard. Then we propose three different suboptimal algorithms for the first problem based on convex relaxation with tree pruning (CRTP), convex relaxation with gradual removal (CRGR) and genetic algorithms (GA). These algorithms offer different tradeoffs in terms of goodness of their solutions and computational complexity. For the second problem, we propose a multiobjective evolutionary algorithm which can generate a Pareto front in a time-efficient manner.

In a single cell downlink with instantaneous channel information, the well-known uplink-downlink duality via Lagrange interpretation helps in algorithm design. By leveraging nonlinear Perron-Frobenius theory, we establish the network duality for the max-min weighted SINR problem in a general multicell network with multiple serving users per cell, whose generic feature reduces to two special scenarios: the single cell multiuser scenario and the multiuser ad hoc network scenario. The network duality can be observed through Perron-Frobenius characterization, and holds for both forms of channel information: the instantaneous channel information and statistical channel information. This characterization of network duality further enables the design of distributed algorithms with geometrically fast convergence rate, which are readily applicable to practical implementation.","doi":"10.1109/CISS.2012.6310832","publicationTitle":"2012 46th Annual Conference on Information Sciences and Systems (CISS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 46th Annual Conference on Information Sciences and Systems (CISS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6299180/6310704/06310832.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CISS.2012.6310832","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6310704","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multicell network duality with instantaneous and statistical channel information: A nonlinear Perron-Frobenius characterization","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6310832","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 March 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6310832/","displayDocTitle":"Multicell network duality with instantaneous and statistical channel information: A nonlinear Perron-Frobenius characterization","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2012","accessionNumber":"13034820","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6310832/","conferenceDate":"21-23 March 2012","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multicell network duality with instantaneous and statistical channel information: A nonlinear Perron-Frobenius characterization","confLoc":"Princeton, NJ, USA","sourcePdf":"62.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074824S","chronDate":"21-23 March 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6299180","isNumber":"6310704","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6299180","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6310704","articleId":"6310832","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6310837,"authors":[{"name":"Malik Muhammad Usman Gul","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, Georgia"],"lastName":"Malik Muhammad Usman Gul","id":"37863126300"},{"name":"Sungeun Lee","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, Georgia"],"lastName":"Sungeun Lee","id":"37086720555"},{"name":"Xiaoli Ma","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, Georgia"],"lastName":"Xiaoli Ma","id":"37279528400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-3140-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-3139-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-3138-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6310837","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":1932},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robustness","OFDM","Estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","intersymbol interference","OFDM modulation","synchronisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["robust synchronization","Zadoff-Chu sequence","ZC sequences","time synchronization","OFDM systems","carrier frequency offsets","CFO","integer frequency offsets","IFO estimation","intersymbol interference","channel estimation"]}],"abstract":"Zadoff-Chu (ZC) sequences have been proposed for time synchronization of OFDM systems due to their ideal correlation properties. In this paper, we examine the performance of ZC sequence based time synchronization in the presence of large carrier frequency offsets (CFOs). We show that the performance of synchronization in the presence of integer frequency offsets (IFOs), is dependent on the root index of the ZC sequence and some sequences may fail entirely in the presence of IFOs. We develop the conditions to choose such root indices for which inter symbol interference can be avoided for a given maximum IFO. We then design a preamble based on the selected ZC sequences to perform timing synchronization as well as IFO estimation.

It is shown both theoretically and numerically, that the new approach improves the receiver performance of the system by up to 3dB without a change to the modulated signal.","doi":"10.1109/CISS.2012.6310840","publicationTitle":"2012 46th Annual Conference on Information Sciences and Systems (CISS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 46th Annual Conference on Information Sciences and Systems (CISS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6299180/6310704/06310840.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CISS.2012.6310840","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6310704","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new improved-performance decoding technique for Asymmetrically-Clipped Optical-OFDM","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6310840","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 March 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6310840/","displayDocTitle":"A new improved-performance decoding technique for Asymmetrically-Clipped Optical-OFDM","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2012","accessionNumber":"13034828","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6310840/","conferenceDate":"21-23 March 2012","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new improved-performance decoding technique for Asymmetrically-Clipped Optical-OFDM","confLoc":"Princeton, NJ, USA","sourcePdf":"75.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.091155S","chronDate":"21-23 March 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6299180","isNumber":"6310704","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6299180","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"6310704","articleId":"6310840","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6310843,"authors":[{"name":"Wednel Cadeau","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, State University of New York at Binghamton, Binghamton, NY"],"firstName":"Wednel","lastName":"Cadeau","id":"38076186100"},{"name":"Xiaohua Li","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, State University of New York at Binghamton, Binghamton, NY"],"firstName":"Xiaohua","lastName":"Li","id":"37086732016"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-3140-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-3139-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-3138-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6310843","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":295},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6310843","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Jamming","Abstracts","Timing","Modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","jamming","Markov processes","probability","radio spectrum management","Rayleigh channels","telecommunication switching"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antijamming performance","cognitive radio network","uncoordinated jammers","fading environment","cognitive-radio-based jammer","antijamming capability","uncooperative jammers","Rayleigh flat-fading propagation","Markov model","CRN transmission","cross-layer analysis","transitional probabilities","smart jamming attack strategy","average throughput expression","CRN communication","CRN spectrum sensing","channel switching"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["cognitive radio networks","dynamic spectrum access","transmission power","jamming","throughput"]}],"doi":"10.1109/CISS.2012.6310843","publicationTitle":"2012 46th Annual Conference on Information Sciences and Systems (CISS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 46th Annual Conference on Information Sciences and Systems (CISS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6299180/6310704/06310843.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CISS.2012.6310843","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6310704","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Anti-jamming performance of cognitive radio networks under multiple uncoordinated jammers in fading environment","abstract":"In this paper, we study both the jamming capability of the cognitive-radio-based jammers and the anti-jamming capability of the cognitive radio networks (CRN), by considering multiple uncooperative jammers and independent Rayleigh flat-fading propagations.

A sequential setup, in which the cognitive users estimate available channels one by one, is considered. In addition, the channel estimation for each channel is also sequential. In particular, cognitive users will determine whether to finish the estimation process of the current channel and switch to next channel for estimation based on the training symbols received so far. To balance the tradeoff between the estimation error and time spent on the channel estimation, we aim to design a switch function and an estimator that minimize a linear combination of these two factors. We obtain the optimal solution for the general case.

Wireless multipath fading links make the network data delivery more challenging. To cope with network dynamics and link failures, we propose a novel network modulation (NeMo) approach for OFDM over large-scale wireless systems. NeMo enhances data persistence by guaranteeing the symbol recovery at the sink(s) without pre-storing or delaying the decoding process by collecting enough symbols. We consider practical channel conditions and show that NeMo enjoys diversity from grouping and subcarrier mapping strategies in OFDM.

Research are mainly based on the asymptotic or limiting distributions of extreme eigenvalues, which require large numbers of samples and sensors. Here we probe into the question of what will happen when the sample size or number of sensors is small. Exploiting a recent result on multivariate analysis of variance, under the presence of primary user's signal, we give a new expression for the distribution of the largest eigenvalue of the sample covariance matrix. It turns out to be much more accurate than existing approximations under asymptotic or limiting assumptions. Noticing the connection between the Moment Generating Function of the distribution of the largest eigenvalue and the certain form of Lauricella function, compact expressions for the Probability Density Function as well as Cumulative Distribution Function of largest eigenvalue of non-central Wishart matrix are given. These results are then applied to analyse the detection performance of our test.

Noting that a water-filling strategy in designing the transmitted waveform implies maximizing channel capacity, we acknowledge previous results on radar waveform design which proved that water-filling maximizes the mutual information between a target impulse response and the received radar signal. We then discuss the radar waveform design problem in the context of multiple waveforms and/or multiple targets, outlining similarities between the corresponding radar scenarios and multiuser communication scenarios.","doi":"10.1109/CISS.2012.6310860","publicationTitle":"2012 46th Annual Conference on Information Sciences and Systems (CISS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 46th Annual Conference on Information Sciences and Systems (CISS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6299180/6310704/06310860.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CISS.2012.6310860","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6310704","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A vector channel approach to waveform design for radar systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6310860","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A vector channel approach to waveform design for radar systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 March 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6310860/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"21-23 March 2012","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2012","accessionNumber":"13034848","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6310860/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A vector channel approach to waveform design for radar systems","confLoc":"Princeton, NJ, USA","sourcePdf":"96.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058018S","chronDate":"21-23 March 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6299180","isNumber":"6310704","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6299180","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6310704","articleId":"6310860","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6310861,"authors":[{"name":"Arsenia Chorti","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Institute of Computer Science (ICS) of the Foundation for Research and Technology - Hellas, Heraklion, Crete, Greece"],"firstName":"Arsenia","lastName":"Chorti","id":"37294375300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-3140-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-3139-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-3138-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6310861","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":198},"abstract":"Physical layer security encompasses information theoretic approaches that could guarantee perfect secrecy in wireless communication systems. In this framework, helping interferer strategies rely on intentionally creating confusion at a potential eavesdropper by injecting a jamming signal. In cases where the information signal has a Gaussian probability density function (pdf) it has been demonstrated that the optimal jamming signal, under an overall power constraint, should also be Gaussian. However, in practical communication systems where data symbols are typically drawn from discrete uniform probability mass functions (pmf), commonly M-ary Quadrature Amplitude and M-ary Phase Shift Keying modulation schemes, the structure of the optimal jamming signal is still an open question. In the present work we aim at shedding light into this question. Our approach is based on formulating a secrecy capacity maximization problem by expressing the optimal arbitrary helping interferer pdf as a mixture of unknown Gaussians. The proposed approximation is well-suited for jamming signals of practical interest, i.e. Gaussian or M-QAM interferers and reveals that in certain scenarios it is advantageous to use jamming signals whose statistical structure resembles the data rather than the noise.","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 46th Annual Conference on Information Sciences and Systems (CISS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6299180/6310704/06310861.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2012 46th Annual Conference on Information Sciences and Systems (CISS)","doi":"10.1109/CISS.2012.6310861","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CISS.2012.6310861","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6310704","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6310861","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Helping interferer physical layer security strategies for M-QAM and M-PSK systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["USA Councils","Approximation methods","Cryptography","Quadrature amplitude modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["jamming","phase shift keying","probability","quadrature amplitude modulation","radio networks","telecommunication security"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["interferer physical layer security strategies","M-QAM systems","M-PSK systems","wireless communication systems","eavesdropper","jamming signal","Gaussian probability density function","optimal jamming signal","discrete uniform probability mass functions","M-ary quadrature amplitude","M-ary phase shift keying modulation","shedding light","secrecy capacity maximization problem","Gaussian interferers","M-QAM interferers","statistical structure"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6310861/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 March 2012","displayDocTitle":"Helping interferer physical layer security strategies for M-QAM and M-PSK systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6310861/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2012","accessionNumber":"13034849","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2012","conferenceDate":"21-23 March 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Helping interferer physical layer security strategies for M-QAM and M-PSK systems","confLoc":"Princeton, NJ, USA","sourcePdf":"97.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069439S","chronDate":"21-23 March 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6299180","isNumber":"6310704","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6299180","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"6310704","articleId":"6310861","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6310873,"authors":[{"name":"Nan Wang","affiliation":["Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Nan","lastName":"Wang","id":"37086765048"},{"name":"Jizhong Han","affiliation":["Institute of Information Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jizhong","lastName":"Han","id":"37085393261"},{"name":"Jinyun Fang","affiliation":["Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jinyun","lastName":"Fang","id":"37398097600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-4722-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1889-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6310873","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":429},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Grammar","Compression algorithms","Statistical analysis","Hidden Markov models","Markov processes","Training","Entropy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["information theory","Markov processes","security of data","telecommunication security"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["anomaly detection algorithm","lossless compression","network security","anomaly detection method","Markovian method","Markovian model","information theory","information theoretic measures","information theoretic anomaly detection framework","information quantity","compression algorithm","grammar compression","data structure","intrusion detection","bug detection"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["anomaly detection","data mining","grammar-based compression"]}],"abstract":"Anomaly detection is essential in network security. It has been researched for decades. Many anomaly detection methods have been proposed. Because of the simplicity of principles, statistical and Markovian methods dominate these approaches. However, their effectiveness is constrained by specific preconditions, which make them work for only appropriate data sets which satisfy their premises. Other than statistical and Markovian model, information theory provides a different perspective about anomaly detection. However, the computation of information theoretic measures is still based on statistics. In this paper, we present a novel, information theoretic anomaly detection framework. Instead of statistics, it employs lossless compression for measuring the information quantity, and detects outliers according to compression result. We also discuss the selection of underlying compression algorithm, and choose a grammar compression for utilizing the structure of data. With grammar compression, our method overcomes the shortcomings of statistical and Markovian methods. In addition, the implementation and operation of our method is even simpler than traditional approaches. We test our method on four data sets about text analyzing, host intrusion detection and bug detection. Experimental results show that, even traditional methods fail in some situations, our simple method works well in all cases.","doi":"10.1109/NAS.2012.8","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE Seventh International Conference on Networking, Architecture, and Storage","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE Seventh International Conference on Networking, Architecture, and Storage","pdfPath":"/iel5/6310178/6310787/06310873.pdf","startPage":"31","endPage":"38","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NAS.2012.8","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6310787","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Anomaly Detection Algorithm Based on Lossless Compression","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6310873","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 June 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6310873/","displayDocTitle":"An Anomaly Detection Algorithm Based on Lossless Compression","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2012","accessionNumber":"13045606","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6310873/","conferenceDate":"28-30 June 2012","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Anomaly Detection Algorithm Based on Lossless Compression","confLoc":"Xiamen, China","sourcePdf":"4722a031.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058791S","chronDate":"28-30 June 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6310178","isNumber":"6310787","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6310178","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"6310787","articleId":"6310873","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6310884,"authors":[{"name":"Li Ruixing","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Information Engineering, Anhui University, Hefei, China"],"firstName":"Li","lastName":"Ruixing","id":"37086769914"},{"name":"Bai Na","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Information Engineering, Anhui University, Hefei, China"],"firstName":"Bai","lastName":"Na","id":"38070785000"},{"name":"Lv Baitao","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Information Engineering, Anhui University, Hefei, China"],"firstName":"Lv","lastName":"Baitao","id":"37086767260"},{"name":"Zhu Jiafeng","affiliation":["National ASIC System Engineering Research Center, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Zhu","lastName":"Jiafeng","id":"37085644713"},{"name":"Wu Xiulong","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Information Engineering, Anhui University, Hefei, China"],"firstName":"Wu","lastName":"Xiulong","id":"37719887700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-4722-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1889-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6310884","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":504},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Leakage current","Random access memory","Integrated circuit modeling","Simulation","Capacitors","Educational institutions","Transistors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compensation","integrated circuit design","leakage currents","SRAM chips","transistor circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bitline leakage current compensation circuit","high-performance SRAM design","high-performance demand","read operation","differential bitline voltage","predetermined leakage current compensation process","VDD","transistor threshold voltage"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6310884","abstract":"The leakage current existing in the bitline of SRAM has attracted more and more concerns for the operation of high-performance SRAM design, especially with the decrease of the threshold voltage of the transistor for high-performance demand, the leakage current would increase exponentially. The increased leakage current may slowdown the performance of the read operation of SRAM because the existence of the leakage current in the bitline may postpone the time to resolve the sufficient differential bitline voltage for SA to sense correctly. In this paper, a new bitline leakage current compensation circuit has been proposed. Different from the traditional technique, the proposed bitline leakage current compensation circuit cancels the \"pre-determined\" leakage current compensation process. Therefore, it dodges the dilemma where the performance of the SRAM may be degraded in some circumstances if the bit-line leakage current is compensated pre-determinedly. The simulation results show that by adopting the proposed compensation circuit, the time needed to develop 1/2 VDD can be reduced by almost 126.4% under the tt process corner.","doi":"10.1109/NAS.2012.19","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE Seventh International Conference on Networking, Architecture, and Storage","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE Seventh International Conference on Networking, Architecture, and Storage","pdfPath":"/iel5/6310178/6310787/06310884.pdf","startPage":"109","endPage":"113","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6310787","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NAS.2012.19","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bitline Leakage Current Compensation Circuit for High-Performance SRAM Design","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6310884/","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 June 2012","displayDocTitle":"Bitline Leakage Current Compensation Circuit for High-Performance SRAM Design","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6310884/","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2012","publicationDate":"June 2012","accessionNumber":"13045617","conferenceDate":"28-30 June 2012","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bitline Leakage Current Compensation Circuit for High-Performance SRAM Design","confLoc":"Xiamen, China","sourcePdf":"4722a109.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051511S","chronDate":"28-30 June 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6310178","isNumber":"6310787","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6310178","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6310787","articleId":"6310884","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6310895,"authors":[{"name":"Qiang Guan","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of North Texas, Denton, Texas, USA"],"firstName":"Qiang","lastName":"Guan","id":"37603022700"},{"name":"Chi-Chen Chiu","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of North Texas, Denton, Texas, USA"],"firstName":"Chi-Chen","lastName":"Chiu","id":"38484742100"},{"name":"Ziming Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of North Texas, Denton, Texas, USA"],"firstName":"Ziming","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37405437200"},{"name":"Song Fu","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of North Texas, Denton, Texas, USA"],"firstName":"Song","lastName":"Fu","id":"37274930100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-4722-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1889-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6310895","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":230},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Extraterrestrial measurements","Clustering algorithms","Redundancy","Servers","Mutual information","Covariance matrix"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","system monitoring"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["anomaly identification","reduced metric space","utility clouds","cloud computing systems","system component complexity","health monitoring tools","metric selection framework","online anomaly detection","metric space combination","metric dimensionality","high detection complexity"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Anomaly Detection","Metric Space","Utility Cloud Management","Statistics","Algorithms"]}],"abstract":"The online detection of anomalies is a vital element of operations in utility clouds. Detection should function for different levels of abstraction including hardware and software, and for the various metrics used in cloud computing systems.

High metric dimensionality and existence of interacting metrics compromise the detection accuracy and lead to high detection complexity. In this paper, we present a metric selection framework and propose systematic approaches to effectively identify and select the most essential metrics for online anomaly detection in utility clouds. Specifically, a mutual information based approach selects metrics with the maximized mutual relevance and the minimized redundancy. Then metric space combination and separation are explored to reduce the metric dimensionality further.

technologies, which provides many benefits, such as high density, non-volatility and low leakage power. However, the limited write endurance of PRAM prevents it from being used as a drop-in replacement of SRAM cache. Moreover, the inherent high latency and power dissipation of write operations are both hindrances that PRAM faces. In this paper, we study the L2 cache write operations incurred by different types of data, and accordingly, propose Wear-Resistant Hybrid Cache Architecture (WRHCA), in which the write access behavior of the hybrid L2 cache, that is composed of SRAM and PRAM, is optimized. Through the prediction of data access patterns, the proposed WRHCA prevents write-prone data from entering PRAM L2 cache, and consequently, the wear-out issue of PRAM is alleviated efficiently. Experimental results on the basis of the trace-driven simulator demonstrate that, as compared to the baseline system with pure PRAM L2 cache, our optimized WRHCA saved 85.5% write operations to PRAM on average, and boosted the performance by the averaged 6.4% CPI reduction. Last but not least, as compared with the primitive 3-level SRAM cache with the same chip area, our WRHCA achieved 60.9% reduction in terms of power consumption.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6310902/","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 June 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"June 2012","accessionNumber":"13045635","htmlLink":"/document/6310902/","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2012","conferenceDate":"28-30 June 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Wear-Resistant Hybrid Cache Architecture with Phase Change Memory","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wear-Resistant Hybrid Cache Architecture with Phase Change Memory","confLoc":"Xiamen, China","sourcePdf":"4722a268.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056775S","chronDate":"28-30 June 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6310178","isNumber":"6310787","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6310178","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6310787","articleId":"6310902","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6310908,"authors":[{"name":"Michael J.

A subset of the devices are mobile users that desire specific files. Each user may already have certain popular files in its cache. The remaining devices are access points that typically have access to a larger set of files. Users can download packets of their requested file from an access point or from a nearby user. Our prior work optimizes peer scheduling in a general setting, but the resulting delay can be large when applied to mobile networks. This paper focuses on the mobile case, and develops a new algorithm that reduces delay by opportunistically grabbing packets from current neighbors. However, it treats a simpler model where each user desires a single file with infinite length. An algorithm that provably optimizes throughput utility while incentivizing participation is developed for this case. The algorithm extends as a simple heuristic in more general cases with finite file sizes and random active and idle periods.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6310704","publicationTitle":"2012 46th Annual Conference on Information Sciences and Systems (CISS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 46th Annual Conference on Information Sciences and Systems (CISS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6299180/6310704/06310908.pdf","doi":"10.1109/CISS.2012.6310908","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CISS.2012.6310908","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Wireless peer-to-peer scheduling in mobile networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 March 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6310908/","displayDocTitle":"Wireless peer-to-peer scheduling in mobile networks","htmlLink":"/document/6310908/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"21-23 March 2012","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"13034853","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2012","publicationDate":"March 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wireless peer-to-peer scheduling in mobile networks","confLoc":"Princeton, NJ, USA","sourcePdf":"184.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061401S","chronDate":"21-23 March 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6299180","isNumber":"6310704","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6299180","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"6310704","articleId":"6310908","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6310913,"authors":[{"name":"Fatemeh Hamidi-Sepehr","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Texas A and M University, USA"],"firstName":"Fatemeh","lastName":"Hamidi-Sepehr","id":"38270025400"},{"name":"Henry D.

A Poisson arrival process is chosen to allow fair comparisons between different block lengths and code rates. A Markov chain, based on the queue length and channel state, is constructed and used to analyze the tail probability of the queue. Our methods are used to evaluate both the probability of decoding failure, under a constraint of the probability of undetected error, and the queueing performance.

The fundamental principle behind such models and much of game theory has been the reliance on expected utility theory (EUT). In this paper, we consider a simple wireless random access game where instead of following the precepts of EUT, the players follow the precepts of Prospect Theory (PT), a theory developed by Kahneman and Tversky to explain real-life decision making that often deviates from the behavior expected under EUT. Specifically, we consider a game where selfish players adjust their transmission probabilities over a collision channel according to rewards received for successful transmission while incurring energy and delay costs. We compare and contrast the Nash equilibria achieved under both EUT and PT and highlight the differences in them.","doi":"10.1109/CISS.2012.6310922","publicationTitle":"2012 46th Annual Conference on Information Sciences and Systems (CISS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 46th Annual Conference on Information Sciences and Systems (CISS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6299180/6310704/06310922.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CISS.2012.6310922","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6310704","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Prospects in a wireless random access game","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6310922","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Prospects in a wireless random access game","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 March 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6310922/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"21-23 March 2012","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2012","accessionNumber":"13034867","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6310922/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Prospects in a wireless random access game","confLoc":"Princeton, NJ, USA","sourcePdf":"198.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061217S","chronDate":"21-23 March 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6299180","isNumber":"6310704","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6299180","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"6310704","articleId":"6310922","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":6310927,"authors":[{"name":"Galen Reeves","affiliation":["Stanford University, Stanford, CA, US"],"firstName":"Galen","lastName":"Reeves","id":"37391923300"},{"name":"Michael Gastpar","affiliation":["Department of EECS, University of California Berkeley, USA"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Gastpar","id":"37273006200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-3140-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-3139-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-3138-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6310927","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":138},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Vectors","Compressed sensing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compressed sensing","information theory","interference (signal)","mean square error methods","message passing","minimax techniques","statistical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compressed sensing phase transition","replica prediction","rigorous bounds","information-theoretic argument","heuristic prediction","statistical physics","sparse recovery","signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio","MMSE dimension","minimax behavior","approximate message passing"]}],"abstract":"In recent work, two different methods have been used to characterize the fundamental limits of compressed sensing. On the one hand are rigorous bounds based on information-theoretic arguments or the analysis of specific algorithms. On the other hand are exact but heuristic predictions made using the replica method from statistical physics. In this paper, it is shown that, for certain problem settings, these bounds are in agreement, and thus provide a rigorous and accurate characterization of the compressed sensing problem. This characterization shows that the limits of sparse recovery can be quantified succinctly in terms of an effective signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio, that depends on the number of measurements and the behavior of the sparse components themselves. Connections with the MMSE dimension by Wu and Verdu and minimax behavior of approximate message passing by Donoho et al. are discussed.","doi":"10.1109/CISS.2012.6310927","publicationTitle":"2012 46th Annual Conference on Information Sciences and Systems (CISS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 46th Annual Conference on Information Sciences and Systems (CISS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6299180/6310704/06310927.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CISS.2012.6310927","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6310704","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Compressed sensing phase transitions: Rigorous bounds versus replica predictions","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6310927","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 March 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6310927/","displayDocTitle":"Compressed sensing phase transitions: Rigorous bounds versus replica predictions","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2012","accessionNumber":"13034872","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6310927/","conferenceDate":"21-23 March 2012","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Compressed sensing phase transitions: Rigorous bounds versus replica predictions","confLoc":"Princeton, NJ, USA","sourcePdf":"204.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.093535S","chronDate":"21-23 March 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6299180","isNumber":"6310704","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6299180","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6310704","articleId":"6310927","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6310931,"authors":[{"name":"Sanjit K.

These applications desire status updates at the recipients to be as timely as possible; however, this is typically constrained by limited network resources. We employ a time-averaged age metric for characterizing performance of such status update systems. We use system abstractions consisting of a source, a service facility and monitors, with the model of the service facility (physical constraints) a given. While prior work examined first-come-first-served (FCFS) queues, this paper looks at the queue discipline of last-come-first-served (LCFS). We explore LCFS systems with and without the ability to preempt the packet currently in service. For each we derive a general expression for system age and solve for the average age a Poisson source can achieve given memoryless service. Specifically, when preemption is allowed, we evaluate how the source would share the service facility with other independent Poisson sources.","doi":"10.1109/CISS.2012.6310931","publicationTitle":"2012 46th Annual Conference on Information Sciences and Systems (CISS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 46th Annual Conference on Information Sciences and Systems (CISS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6299180/6310704/06310931.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6310704","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CISS.2012.6310931","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Status updates through queues","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6310931","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 March 2012","displayDocTitle":"Status updates through queues","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6310931/","publicationDate":"March 2012","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2012","accessionNumber":"13034876","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","conferenceDate":"21-23 March 2012","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Status updates through queues","confLoc":"Princeton, NJ, USA","sourcePdf":"208.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072886S","chronDate":"21-23 March 2012","isNumber":"6310704","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6299180","citationCount":"187","articleId":"6310931","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-23"},{"_id":6310934,"authors":[{"name":"Junyoung Nam","affiliation":["Mobile Communications Division, Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Junyoung","lastName":"Nam","id":"37290298400"},{"name":"Jae-Young Ahn","affiliation":["Mobile Communications Division, Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jae-Young","lastName":"Ahn","id":"37403231000"},{"name":"Ansuman Adhikary","affiliation":["Ming-Hsieh Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Southern California, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Ansuman","lastName":"Adhikary","id":"37847743700"},{"name":"Giuseppe Caire","affiliation":["Ming-Hsieh Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Southern California, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Giuseppe","lastName":"Caire","id":"37267243200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-3140-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-3139-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-3138-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6310934","dbTime":"18 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":86,"citationCountPatent":7,"totalDownloads":4065},"abstract":"We propose Joint Spatial Division and Multiplexing (JSDM), an approach to multiuser MIMO downlink that exploits the structure of the channel vectors correlation in order to allow for a large number of base station antennas while requiring a considerably reduced channel state information (CSI) feedback from the users. Thanks to the reduced CSI requirement, JSDM allows the use of a large number of base station antennas also in FDD systems. This work presents the correlated channel model, the main idea of JSDM precoding, and the design of JSDM precoding, formed by the concatenation of a pre-beamforming matrix based only on the structure of the channel covariance, with suitable multiuser precoding based on the CSI of the reduced dimensional transformed channels. We show that in some cases JSDM incurs no loss of optimality with respect to the MIMO broadcast channel with full CSI.","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 46th Annual Conference on Information Sciences and Systems (CISS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6299180/6310704/06310934.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2012 46th Annual Conference on Information Sciences and Systems (CISS)","doi":"10.1109/CISS.2012.6310934","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CISS.2012.6310934","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6310704","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6310934","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint spatial division and multiplexing: Realizing massive MIMO gains with limited channel state information","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Covariance matrix","Downlink","Joints","Vectors","Correlation","Antennas","Channel estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","array signal processing","broadcast channels","channel coding","correlation methods","covariance matrices","feedback","MIMO communication","precoding","space division multiplexing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["joint spatial division multiplexing","massive MIMO gains","limited channel state information","multiuser MIMO downlink approach","channel vector correlation","base station antennas","channel state information feedback","CSI feedback","FDD systems","correlated channel model","JSDM precoding","prebeamforming matrix","channel covariance matrix","multiuser precoding","reduced dimensional transformed channels","MIMO broadcast channel"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6310934/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 March 2012","displayDocTitle":"Joint spatial division and multiplexing: Realizing massive MIMO gains with limited channel state information","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6310934/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2012","accessionNumber":"13034879","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2012","conferenceDate":"21-23 March 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint spatial division and multiplexing: Realizing massive MIMO gains with limited channel state information","confLoc":"Princeton, NJ, USA","sourcePdf":"212.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067596S","chronDate":"21-23 March 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6299180","isNumber":"6310704","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6299180","citationCount":"86","xplore-issue":"6310704","articleId":"6310934","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6310942,"authors":[{"name":"Viveck Cadambe","affiliation":["Research Laboratory of Electronics, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Viveck","lastName":"Cadambe","id":"37540467200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-3140-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-3139-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-3138-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6310942","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":131},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6310942","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Receivers","Encoding","Network coding","Indexes","Context","Computer architecture"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["broadcast channels","network coding","radio receivers","scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multi-way relay based deterministic broadcast","side information","pair-wise network coding","sum-capacity optimal","broadcast channel","receivers","identity function","multi-way relay channel","XOR","scheduling"]}],"doi":"10.1109/CISS.2012.6310942","publicationTitle":"2012 46th Annual Conference on Information Sciences and Systems (CISS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 46th Annual Conference on Information Sciences and Systems (CISS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6299180/6310704/06310942.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"3","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CISS.2012.6310942","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6310704","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-way relay based deterministic broadcast with side information: Pair-wise network coding is sum-capacity optimal","abstract":"We consider a K user deterministic broadcast channel where the receivers have apriori side information of a set of messages. The (deterministic) broadcast channel defined by the identity function on {0; 1}, i.e., all the receivers receive the input bit free-of-noise. The message set is inspired by the multi-way relay channel which has K users communicating through a relay, where each user has an independent message for the remaining K - 1 users. The multi-way relay channel can be converted to a broadcast channel with side information if the relay is able to decode all the messages. Thus, in the broadcast set up, there are K(K - 1) messages, with K - 1 messages intended for each receiver. Each receiver has apriori side information of a (different) set of K-1 messages. In this set up, when there are K= 2 users, it is well known that the optimal strategy for sum-capacity is to use network coding, i.e., to send an XOR of the two messages since each receiver can cancel the interfering message using its side information. The main result of this note is an outerbound for the K user version of this channel showing that scheduling users pairwise and using network coding for the scheduled pair is optimal.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 March 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6310942/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"13034887","publicationDate":"March 2012","conferenceDate":"21-23 March 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6310942/","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Multi-way relay based deterministic broadcast with side information: Pair-wise network coding is sum-capacity optimal","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-way relay based deterministic broadcast with side information: Pair-wise network coding is sum-capacity optimal","confLoc":"Princeton, NJ, USA","sourcePdf":"222.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.092854S","chronDate":"21-23 March 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6299180","isNumber":"6310704","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6299180","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"6310704","articleId":"6310942","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6310950,"authors":[{"name":"Sergio Verd\u00fa","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Princeton University, Princeton, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Sergio","lastName":"Verd\u00fa","id":"37274351500"},{"name":"Ioannis Kontoyiannis","affiliation":["Department of Informatics, Athens University of Economics and Business, Athens, Greece"],"firstName":"Ioannis","lastName":"Kontoyiannis","id":"37283907600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-3140-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-3139-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-3138-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6310950","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":124},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6310950","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Approximation methods","Random variables","Entropy","Data compression","Dispersion","Blogs","Gaussian approximation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data compression","entropy codes","Gaussian processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["lossless data compression rate","asymptotics","non-asymptotics","fixed-to-variable lossless compression","source information spectrum","arbitrary sources","Gaussian approximations","optimum rate","entropy rate","varentropy rate","blocklengths","optimum fixed-to-variable code"]}],"abstract":"This paper considers the distribution of the optimum rate of fixed-to-variable lossless compression.

The data deduplication technology has been demonstrated to be very effective in shortening the backup window and saving the network bandwidth and storage space in cloud backup, archiving and primary storage systems such as VM platforms. However, the delay and power consumption of the restore operations from a deduplicated storage can be significantly higher than those without deduplication. The main reason lies in the fact that a file or block is split into multiple small data chunks that are often located in non-sequential locations on HDDs after deduplication, which can cause a subsequent read operation to invoke many HDD I/O requests involving multiple disk seeks. To address this problem, in this paper we propose SAR, an SSD Assisted Restore scheme, that effectively exploits the high random-read performance and low power-consumption properties of SSDs and the unique data sharing characteristic of deduplication-based storage system by storing in SSDs the unique data chunks with high reference count, small size and non-sequential characteristics. In this way, many critical random-read requests to HDDs are replaced by read requests to SSDs, thus significantly improving the system performance and energy efficiency. The extensive trace-driven and VM restore evaluations on the prototype implementation of SAR show that SAR outperforms the traditional deduplication-based schemes significantly, in terms of both restore performance and energy efficiency.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NAS.2012.48","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6310787","startPage":"328","endPage":"337","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE Seventh International Conference on Networking, Architecture, and Storage","pdfPath":"/iel5/6310178/6310787/06310961.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"SAR: SSD Assisted Restore Optimization for Deduplication-Based Storage Systems in the Cloud","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6310961/","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 June 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6310961/","displayDocTitle":"SAR: SSD Assisted Restore Optimization for Deduplication-Based Storage Systems in the Cloud","conferenceDate":"28-30 June 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2012","accessionNumber":"13045645","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SAR: SSD Assisted Restore Optimization for Deduplication-Based Storage Systems in the Cloud","confLoc":"Xiamen, China","sourcePdf":"4722a328.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.098152S","chronDate":"28-30 June 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6310178","isNumber":"6310787","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6310178","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"6310787","articleId":"6310961","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6311135,"authors":[{"name":"Hieu V.

Before performing PCR-RFLP for SNP genotyping, the feasible primer pair and the available restriction enzymes for discriminating the target SNP are required. This is a tedious and time-consuming task when using manual search without any computer assisting. Genetic Algorithm (GA) has been widely applied to many fields and yielded good solutions. However, in many used GAs, the number of generations are usually fixed and make them are inefficient in determining their adequate terminations. In this paper, we use GA with an adaptive stopping criterion to implement the PCR-RFLP primer design. The different numbers of generations are used to perform the PCR-RFLP primer design, and the adaptive generations are also observed and discussed.","doi":"10.1109/ICCI-CC.2012.6311176","pdfPath":"/iel5/6302081/6311124/06311176.pdf","startPage":"372","endPage":"379","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 11th International Conference on Cognitive Informatics and Cognitive Computing","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 11th International Conference on Cognitive Informatics and Cognitive Computing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCI-CC.2012.6311176","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6311124","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Apply genetic algorithm with an adaptive stopping criterion to PCR-RFLP Primer Design","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6311176/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 Aug. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Apply genetic algorithm with an adaptive stopping criterion to PCR-RFLP Primer Design","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2012","accessionNumber":"13016258","publicationDate":"Aug. 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6311176/","conferenceDate":"22-24 Aug. 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Apply genetic algorithm with an adaptive stopping criterion to PCR-RFLP Primer Design","confLoc":"Kyoto, Japan","sourcePdf":"56.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.106075S","chronDate":"22-24 Aug. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6302081","isNumber":"6311124","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6302081","xplore-issue":"6311124","articleId":"6311176","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6311188,"authors":[{"name":"Runhua Wang","affiliation":["Chongqing University of Science and Technology, Chongqing, China"],"firstName":"Runhua","lastName":"Wang","id":"37899525000"},{"name":"Yi Tang","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Chongqing University of Science and Technology, Chongqing, China"],"firstName":"Yi","lastName":"Tang","id":"37896701600"},{"name":"Guoquan Liu","affiliation":["College of Automation, Chongqing University, Chongqing, China"],"firstName":"Guoquan","lastName":"Liu","id":"37900762200"},{"name":"Lei Li","affiliation":["Network Information Center, Chongqing University of Science and Technology, Chongqing, China"],"firstName":"Lei","lastName":"Li","id":"38486678900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2795-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2794-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-2793-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6311188","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":88},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Genetics","Genetic algorithms","Biological neural networks","Biological cells","Predictive models","Encoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feedforward neural nets","forecasting theory","generalisation (artificial intelligence)","genetic algorithms","learning (artificial intelligence)","purchasing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["book purchasing model","improved genetic neural network","modeling method","scientific purchasing mode","uniform purchasing mode","book purchasing process","improved standard genetic algorithm","feed forward neural network training","threshold value","feed forward neural network weight adjustment","optimized neural network","forecast classification","simulation experiment","forecast performance","generalization ability"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Book purchasing model","genetic neural network","optimization"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6311188","abstract":"A modeling method based on genetic neural network used for book purchasing is put forward on account of lacking of a set of scientific and uniform purchasing mode and model in current book purchasing process.

We analyze and simplify a MU Markov decision process (MDP), whose objective is to maximize the long-term sum of utilities across the video terminals in a decentralized fashion, by jointly optimizing the packet scheduling and physical layer, under the assumption that some nodes are willing to act as cooperative relays. The resulting MU-MDP is a pricing-based distributed resource allocation algorithm, where the price reflects the expected future congestion in the network. Compared to a non-cooperative setting, we observe that the resource price increases in networks supporting low transmission rates and decreases for high transmission rates. Additionally, cooperation allows users with feeble direct signals to significantly improve their video quality, with a moderate increase in total network energy consumption that is far less than the energy these nodes would require to achieve the same video quality without cooperation.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"October  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6311216/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 September 2012","volume":"30","issue":"9","accessionNumber":"13012791","publicationDate":"October 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6311216/","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2012","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Transmitting Important Bits and Sailing High Radio Waves: A Decentralized Cross-Layer Approach to Cooperative Video Transmission","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Transmitting Important Bits and Sailing High Radio Waves: A Decentralized Cross-Layer Approach to Cooperative Video Transmission","sourcePdf":"1597jsac0912mastro.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.095291S","chronDate":"October  2012","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"6310162","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"6310162","articleId":"6311216","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6311217,"authors":[{"name":"Weiqiang Xu","affiliation":["School of Information Science & Technology, Zhejiang Sci-Tech University, Hangzhou, P.

Based on the network utility maximization framework, we formulate the problem as a non-convex optimization problem subject to the per-cell power constraints, in which a general utility function of SINR is used to characterize the network performance. To solve the problem in a distributed fashion, we devise an algorithm based on the non-cooperative game with pricing mechanism. We give a sufficient condition for the convergence of the algorithm to the Nash equilibrium (NE). Moreover, to speed up the optimization of the beam-vectors at each cell, we derive an efficient algorithm to solve the KKT conditions at each cell. We provide extensive simulation results to demonstrate that the proposed distributed multi-cell beamforming algorithm converges to an NE point in just a few iterations with low information exchange overhead. Moreover, it provides significant performance gains, especially under the strong interference scenario, in comparison with several existing multi-cell interference mitigation schemes, such as the distributed interference alignment method.","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2012.121003","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/49/6310162/06311217.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2012.121003","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6310162","startPage":"1605","endPage":"1613","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Pricing-Based Distributed Downlink Beamforming in Multi-Cell OFDMA Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6311217","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Pricing-Based Distributed Downlink Beamforming in Multi-Cell OFDMA Networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"October  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6311217/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 September 2012","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"30","issue":"9","publicationDate":"October 2012","accessionNumber":"13012792","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6311217/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Pricing-Based Distributed Downlink Beamforming in Multi-Cell OFDMA Networks","sourcePdf":"1605jsac0912xu.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.067494S","chronDate":"October  2012","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"6310162","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"6310162","articleId":"6311217","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6311218,"authors":[{"name":"Yang Cao","affiliation":["Wuhan National Laboratory for Optoelectronics, Department of Electronics and Information Engineering, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Yang","lastName":"Cao","id":"37654214200"},{"name":"Tao Jiang","affiliation":["Wuhan National Laboratory for Optoelectronics, Department of Electronics and Information Engineering, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Tao","lastName":"Jiang","id":"37279307300"},{"name":"Chonggang Wang","affiliation":["InterDigital Communication Corporation, USA"],"firstName":"Chonggang","lastName":"Wang","id":"37280016400"},{"name":"Lei Zhang","affiliation":["Wuhan National Laboratory for Optoelectronics, Department of Electronics and Information Engineering, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Lei","lastName":"Zhang","id":"38474315400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0733-8716"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0008"}],"articleNumber":"6311218","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":28,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1002},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Satellite broadcasting","Relays","Downlink","Cognitive radio","Resource management","Optimization","OFDM"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","channel allocation","cognitive radio","cooperative communication","frequency division multiple access","integer programming","OFDM modulation","relays","resource allocation","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CRAC","cognitive radio assisted cooperation","downlink transmission","OFDMA-based cellular network","orthogonal frequency-division multiple access","spectrum sensing","white space","resource allocation","transmission mode selection","relay station allocation","power-subchannel allocation transmission","sum utility maximization problem","base station","mixed integer programming problem","leverage dual decomposition method","centralized optimal solution","downlink network throughput"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cognitive radio","cooperative relay","downlink transmission","OFDMA-based cellular networks","resource allocation"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we propose a novel framework of cognitive radio assisted cooperation (CRAC) for downlink transmissions in orthogonal frequency-division multiple access (OFDMA) - based cellular networks. In the proposed CRAC framework, relay stations are deployed in each cell and have spectrum sensing capability. In turn, they can access unoccupied white space to opportunistically obtain additional sub-channels to assist relaying information for cellular users. One of promising novelties is that the proposed CRAC considers joint resource allocation which includes transmission mode selection, relay station allocation, and transmit power/sub-channel allocation, to cost-effectively provide services and applications. Specifically, we first formulate the joint resource allocation as a sum utility maximization problem with power constraints on the base station and relay stations, which is a mixed integer programming problem. Then, we leverage dual decomposition method and derive a centralized optimal solution. Extensive simulation results are presented and demonstrate that the proposed CRAC can achieve a significant performance improvement in terms of the downlink network throughput while maintaining comparable fairness among cellular users in contrast to the traditional relay-based cooperation approach.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"CRAC: Cognitive Radio Assisted Cooperation for Downlink Transmissions in OFDMA-Based Cellular Networks","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2012.121004","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/49/6310162/06311218.pdf","startPage":"1614","endPage":"1622","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2012.121004","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6310162","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6311218","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6311218/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 September 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"October  2012","displayDocTitle":"CRAC: Cognitive Radio Assisted Cooperation for Downlink Transmissions in OFDMA-Based Cellular Networks","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"30","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/6311218/","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2012","publicationDate":"October 2012","accessionNumber":"13012793","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"CRAC: Cognitive Radio Assisted Cooperation for Downlink Transmissions in OFDMA-Based Cellular Networks","sourcePdf":"1614jsac0912cao.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.083321S","chronDate":"October  2012","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"6310162","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"6310162","articleId":"6311218","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6311223,"authors":[{"name":"Lingjie Duan","affiliation":["Engineering Systems and Design Pillar, Singapore University of Technology and Design, Singapore"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/6310162/6311223/6311223-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Lingjie Duan (S'09\u2013M'12) received his Ph.D. degree in Information Engineering at The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong in 2012.

This paper considers a challenging attack scenario, where multiple attackers cooperatively maximize their aggregate spectrum utilization. Without attack-prevention mechanisms, we show that honest secondary users (SUs) are unable to opportunistically transmit over the licensed spectrum and may even get penalized for collisions caused by attackers. To prevent such attacks, we propose two attack-prevention mechanisms with direct and indirect punishments. Our key idea is to identify collisions with the primary user (PU) that should not happen if all SUs follow the fusion center's decision. Unlike prior work, the proposed simple mechanisms do not require the fusion center to identify and exclude attackers. The direct punishment can effectively prevent all attackers from behaving maliciously. The indirect punishment is easier to implement and can prevent attacks when the attackers care enough about their long-term reward.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2012.121009","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6310162","startPage":"1658","endPage":"1665","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/49/6310162/06311223.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Attack Prevention for Collaborative Spectrum Sensing in Cognitive Radio Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6311223/","chronOrPublicationDate":"October  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 September 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6311223/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Attack Prevention for Collaborative Spectrum Sensing in Cognitive Radio Networks","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"October 2012","accessionNumber":"13012798","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"30","issue":"9","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Attack Prevention for Collaborative Spectrum Sensing in Cognitive Radio Networks","sourcePdf":"1658jsac0912duan.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.10411S","chronDate":"October  2012","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"6310162","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"64","xplore-issue":"6310162","articleId":"6311223","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6311224,"authors":[{"name":"Qian Wang","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Software Engineering, Wuhan University of China, China","Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Illinois Institute of Technology, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/6310162/6311224/6311224-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Qian Wang received the B.S. degree from Wuhan University, China, in 2003, the M.S. degree from Shanghai Institute of Microsystem and Information Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, China, in 2006, and the Ph.D. degree from Illinois Institute of Technology, USA, in 2012, all in Electrical Engineering.

The state of the art, however, still suffers from major limitations,e.g., low key generation rate, lower entropy of key bits and a high reliance on node mobility. In this paper, a novel cooperative key generation protocol is developed to facilitate high-rate key generation in narrowband fading channels, where two keying nodes extract the phase randomness of the fading channel with the aid of relay node(s). For the first time, we explicitly consider the effect of estimation methods on the extraction of secret key bits from the underlying fading channels and focus on a popular statistical method - maximum likelihood estimation (MLE). The performance of the cooperative key generation scheme is extensively evaluated theoretically. We successfully establish both a theoretical upper bound on the maximum secret key rate from mutual information of correlated random sources and a more practical upper bound from Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) in estimation theory. Numerical examples and simulation studies are also presented to demonstrate the performance of the cooperative key generation system. The results show that the key rate can be improved by a couple of orders of magnitude compared to the existing approaches.","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2012.121010","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2012.121010","startPage":"1666","endPage":"1674","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/49/6310162/06311224.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6310162","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cooperative Secret Key Generation from Phase Estimation in Narrowband Fading Channels","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6311224/","chronOrPublicationDate":"October  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 September 2012","displayDocTitle":"Cooperative Secret Key Generation from Phase Estimation in Narrowband Fading Channels","volume":"30","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2012","accessionNumber":"13012799","publicationDate":"October 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6311224/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cooperative Secret Key Generation from Phase Estimation in Narrowband Fading Channels","sourcePdf":"1666jsac0912wang1.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.113116S","chronDate":"October  2012","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"6310162","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"71","xplore-issue":"6310162","articleId":"6311224","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6311236,"authors":[{"name":"Jieun Yu","affiliation":["Network Research Laboratory, the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Korea University, Seoul, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/6310162/6311236/6311236-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jieun Yu received her B.S. degree in computer science and engineering from Korea University, Seoul, Korea in 2004.

Cooperative Communication (CC) is a new technology that allows multiple nodes to simultaneously transmit the same data. It can save transmission power and extend transmission coverage. However, prior research work on topology control considers CC only in the aspect of energy saving, not that of coverage extension. We observe that CC can bridge (link) disconnected networks and therefore identify the challenges in the development of a centralized topology control scheme, named shape Cooperative Bridges, which reduces transmission power of nodes as well as increases network connectivity. We propose three algorithms that select energy efficient neighbor nodes, which assist a source node to communicate with a destination node: an optimal method and two greedy heuristics. In addition, we consider a distributed version of the proposed topology control scheme. Our findings are substantiated by an extensive simulation study, through which we show that the shape Cooperative Bridges scheme substantially increases the connectivity with tolerable increase of transmission power compared to other existing topology control schemes, which means that it outperforms in terms of a connectivity-to-power ratio.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"October  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6311236/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 September 2012","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"13012811","volume":"30","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/6311236/","publicationDate":"October 2012","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Topology Control in Cooperative Wireless Ad-Hoc Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Topology Control in Cooperative Wireless Ad-Hoc Networks","sourcePdf":"1771jsac0912yu.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.082404S","chronDate":"October  2012","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"6310162","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"6310162","articleId":"6311236","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6311240,"authors":[{"name":"Mahdi Hajiaghayi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Toronto, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/6310162/6311240/6311240-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Mahdi Hajiaghayi (S'10) received the B.Sc. degrees in electrical engineering and petroleum engineering simultaneously from Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran, in 2005, and the M.Sc. degree in electrical and computer engineering from the University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada, in 2007.

Common relaying strategies are considered, and transmission power constraints are imposed on both individual transmitters and the aggregate over all transmitters. The joint optimization problem naturally leads to a mixed-integer program. Despite the general expectation that such problems are intractable, we construct an efficient algorithm to find an optimal solution, which incurs computational complexity that is polynomial in the number of channels and the number of users. We further demonstrate through numerical experiments that the jointly optimal solution can significantly improve system performance over its suboptimal alternatives.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/49/6310162/06311240.pdf","startPage":"1806","endPage":"1814","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2012.121026","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2012.121026","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6310162","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6311240","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Jointly Optimal Channel and Power Assignment for Dual-Hop Multi-Channel Multi-User Relaying","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Resource management","Optimization","Joints","Polynomials","Computational complexity","OFDM"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel allocation","computational complexity","cooperative communication","integer programming"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["jointly optimal channel-power assignment","dual-hop multichannel multiuser relaying strategy","jointly optimizing channel pairing problem","channel-user assignment","power allocation","weighted sum-rate","single-relay cooperative system","transmission power constraints","transmitters","mixed-integer programming","computational complexity"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["multi-channel multi-user relaying","channel pairing","channel-user assignment","power allocation","joint optimization","three-dimensional assignment problem","Lagrange duality"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6311240/","chronOrPublicationDate":"October  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 September 2012","displayDocTitle":"Jointly Optimal Channel and Power Assignment for Dual-Hop Multi-Channel Multi-User Relaying","volume":"30","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/6311240/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"October 2012","accessionNumber":"13012815","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Jointly Optimal Channel and Power Assignment for Dual-Hop Multi-Channel Multi-User Relaying","sourcePdf":"1806jsac0912hajiaghay.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.083286S","chronDate":"October  2012","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"6310162","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"6310162","articleId":"6311240","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6311241,"authors":[{"name":"Walid Saad","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, University of Miami, Coral Gables, FL, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/6310162/6311241/6311241-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Walid Saad (S'07, M'10) received his B.E. from the Lebanese University in 2004, his M.E. in Computer and Communications Engineering from the American University of Beirut in 2007, and his Ph.D degree from the University of Oslo in 2010.

To address this problem, a coalitional game is formulated between the cognitive devices and an algorithm for cooperative coalition formation is proposed. It is shown that the proposed coalition formation algorithm allows the cognitive nodes that are experiencing a similar behavior from some PUs to self-organize into disjoint, independent coalitions. Inside each coalition, the cooperative cognitive nodes use Bayesian nonparametric techniques so as to improve the accuracy of the estimated PUs' activity distributions. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm significantly improves the estimates of the PUs' activity patterns.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"October  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6311241/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 September 2012","volume":"30","issue":"9","accessionNumber":"13012816","publicationDate":"October 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6311241/","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2012","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A Cooperative Bayesian Nonparametric Framework for Primary User Activity Monitoring in Cognitive Radio Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Cooperative Bayesian Nonparametric Framework for Primary User Activity Monitoring in Cognitive Radio Networks","sourcePdf":"1815jsac0912saad.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.110832S","chronDate":"October  2012","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"6310162","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"6310162","articleId":"6311241","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6311242,"authors":[{"name":"Yuan Shen","affiliation":["Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems (LIDS), Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/6310162/6311242/6311242-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yuan Shen (S'05) received his B.S. degree (with highest honor) from Tsinghua University, China, in 2005, and S.M. degree from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), Cambridge, MA, in 2008, both in electrical engineering.

The proposed scheme exploits unique characteristics of the color plus depth map stereoscopic video, where the color sequence has a more significant impact on the reconstructed video quality. The UEP scheme assigns more protection to the color sequence than the depth map so as to achieve high quality 3-D video. Different levels of protection are assigned through hierarchical 16-QAM. The color data with high priority (HP) are mapped onto the most significant bits (MSBs) of the 16- QAM constellation points and the depth map with low priority (LP) are mapped onto the less significant bits (LSBs). Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed UEP scheme outperforms the conventional equal error protection (EEP) schemes by up to 5 dB in terms of the received left and right views quality.","doi":"10.1109/TCE.2012.6311311","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/30/6311306/06311311.pdf","startPage":"731","endPage":"738","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCE.2012.6311311","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6311306","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Unequal error protection scheme based hierarchical 16-QAM for 3-D video transmission","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6311311","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 September 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"August  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6311311/","displayDocTitle":"Unequal error protection scheme based hierarchical 16-QAM for 3-D video transmission","volume":"58","issue":"3","publicationDate":"August 2012","accessionNumber":"13014809","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6311311/","dateOfInsertion":"27 September 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Unequal error protection scheme based hierarchical 16-QAM for 3-D video transmission","sourcePdf":"p0731-alajel.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.057372S","chronDate":"August  2012","xplore-pub-id":"30","isNumber":"6311306","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"30","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"6311306","articleId":"6311311","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6311312,"authors":[{"name":"Chu Yu","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, National Ilan University, Yilan, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/30/6311306/6311312/6311312-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Chu Yu (M'11) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electronic engineering from the National Taiwan University of Science and Technology, Taipei, Taiwan, in 1991 and 1993, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from the National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan, in 1999.

It also presents a memory-efficient and low-latency interleaver implementation technique for the MIMO-OFDM communication system. It is shown that among the four coding and interleaving schemes studied, the cross-antenna coding and per-antenna interleaving performs the best under all SNR conditions and for all modulation schemes. It is also the best scheme as far as the hardware resource implication and power dissipation are concerned, which are particularly important in the context of consumer electronics. Next, using the proposed interleaver, a MIMO-OFDM based transmitter employing a double data stream 2\u00d72 MIMO spatial multiplexing system is built.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCE.2012.6311315","doi":"10.1109/TCE.2012.6311315","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/30/6311306/06311315.pdf","startPage":"758","endPage":"766","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6311306","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis and design of coding and interleaving in a MIMO-OFDM communication system","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Analysis and design of coding and interleaving in a MIMO-OFDM communication system","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6311315/","chronOrPublicationDate":"August  2012","isJournal":true,"volume":"58","issue":"3","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"August 2012","accessionNumber":"13014813","dateOfInsertion":"27 September 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6311315/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 September 2012","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis and design of coding and interleaving in a MIMO-OFDM communication system","sourcePdf":"p0758-iqbal.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.065006S","chronDate":"August  2012","xplore-pub-id":"30","isNumber":"6311306","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"30","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"6311306","articleId":"6311315","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6311317,"authors":[{"name":"Jinwook Kim","affiliation":["Korea Electrotechnology Research Institute (KERI), University of Science and Technology, Ansan, Gyeonggi-Do, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/30/6311306/6311317/6311317-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["JinWook Kim (S'11) received his B.S. degree in Electronic Engineering from Ajou University, Suwon, in 2009.

Recently, the scope of WSN technologies has been expanded to places such as the home, in order to provide the residents with various intelligent services, such as home automation services or home energy management services. However, due to their architectural constraints, such as the trade-off between the performance and cost, WSNs are not effectively implemented in home environments. Therefore, this paper proposes a ZigBee-based intelligent self-adjusting sensor (ZiSAS) in order to address these concerns.

However, NAND flash memory has certain hardware limitations such as an \"erase-before-write\" constraint, which creates a long write latency. Therefore, many studies have been performed to reduce the write latency of NAND flash, one of which uses phase-changed RAM (PRAM) as a supplemental device to overcome the disadvantages of NAND flash memory. However, it is difficult to apply PRAM to storage systems owing to its limited density and high cost per capacity. To solve this problem, a novel management scheme for PRAM/NAND flash hybrid storage is proposed. Our proposed method uses limited PRAM space more efficiently by reducing the size of the data to be stored through an efficient compression scheme using differential values and rates. In addition, the proposed method improves the performance and durability of storage systems by efficiently reducing the flash program operation. Our experiments show that the proposed scheme can improve the performance and durability of PRAM/NAND flash hybrid storage with only slight increases in hardware costs.","doi":"10.1109/TCE.2012.6311324","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/30/6311306/06311324.pdf","startPage":"825","endPage":"833","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCE.2012.6311324","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6311306","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An efficient use of PRAM for an enhancement in the performance and durability of NAND storage systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 September 2012","displayDocTitle":"An efficient use of PRAM for an enhancement in the performance and durability of NAND storage systems","volume":"58","issue":"3","dateOfInsertion":"27 September 2012","accessionNumber":"13014821","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"August 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6311324/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6311324/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"August  2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An efficient use of PRAM for an enhancement in the performance and durability of NAND storage systems","sourcePdf":"p0825-lee.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.051024S","chronDate":"August  2012","xplore-pub-id":"30","isNumber":"6311306","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"30","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"6311306","articleId":"6311324","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6311326,"authors":[{"name":"Hyotaek Shim","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/30/6311306/6311326/6311326-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Hyotaek Shim received his B.S. degree in Computer Engineering from Inha University, Republic of Korea, in 2006.

In particular, in such consumer devices, energy saving is a major concern under limited battery capacity. Although a disk can be spun down during idle time for energy saving, it has been observed that there are frequent read and write requests generated by background applications, even while there is no user activity. In the hybrid storage, the flash cache is used for reducing disk activities and prolonging disk spin-down time. During the spin-down time, write requests can be temporarily stored in the flash cache, whereas read requests should be carefully handled to avoid frequent disk spin-ups. This paper presents Best-effort Energy Saving Techniques (BEST) that make the best use of the hybrid storage to provide low energy consumption, even under many background applications. In addition, the proposed techniques ensure the lifetime of the hybrid storage by considering the limited block erase and load/unload cycles of the flash memory and hard disk, respectively. Evaluation results demonstrate that the proposed techniques achieve considerable energy saving under various workloads, compared with previous studies.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hard disks","Flash memory","Spinning","Energy efficiency","Power demand","Energy consumption","Algorithm design and analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cache storage","energy consumption","flash memories","hard discs","NAND circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["BEST","best-effort energy saving techniques","NAND flash-based hybrid storage","hard disk","flash cache","mobile PC","limited battery capacity","disk activities","disk spin-down time","energy consumption"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Power consumption","disk spin-down","hybridstorage","NAND flash memory"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6311326","doi":"10.1109/TCE.2012.6311326","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/30/6311306/06311326.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCE.2012.6311326","startPage":"841","endPage":"848","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6311306","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"BEST: Best-effort energy saving techniques for NAND flash-based hybrid storage","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"BEST: Best-effort energy saving techniques for NAND flash-based hybrid storage","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6311326/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"August  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 September 2012","volume":"58","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/6311326/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"27 September 2012","publicationDate":"August 2012","accessionNumber":"13014823","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"BEST: Best-effort energy saving techniques for NAND flash-based hybrid storage","sourcePdf":"p0841-shim.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.052352S","chronDate":"August  2012","xplore-pub-id":"30","isNumber":"6311306","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"30","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6311306","articleId":"6311326","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6311327,"authors":[{"name":"Hakyong Lee","affiliation":["Samsung Electronics Corporation, Hwasung, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/30/6311306/6311327/6311327-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Hakyong Lee received his Bachelor's degree in Information and Communication engineering from Sungkyunkwan University, Korea in 2003.

However, the reliability of data stored in flash memory has dramatically decreased, requiring an efficient mechanism to detect and correct bit errors during read and write operations of the data. For this purpose, when user data are often written into a flash page, an Error Correction Code (ECC) for the data is generated and stored in the spare area of the page. ECCs tend to become longer to correct more bit errors, sometimes beyond what is affordable by the spare area. In order to cope with this problem, there have been many attempts to keep ECCs in the data area, as opposed to the spare area of the flash memory. However, an additional mapping mechanism is required to locate ECCs for a given data page, and the program time and cycle are increased due to reading/storing the ECCs. In this paper, we present a novel ECC management mechanism with an assist from PCM for NAND flash storage systems. This technique uses PCM as a temporal storage to store ECCs for the data in log blocks. Later, the pages in log blocks are merged into data blocks with their ECCs kept in the PCM. Our experimental results show that the overhead from ECC management has been improved by 57% and 69% over previous attempts in BAST and FAST mapping schemes, respectively.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Phase change materials","Error correction codes","Flash memory","Reliability","Computer architecture","Phase change random access memory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error correction codes","flash memories","NAND circuits","random-access storage"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["PCRAM assisted ECC management","data reliability","flash storage systems","percell bit density","semiconductor technology","NAND flash memories","nonvolatile storage","flash memory","error correction code","mapping mechanism","PCM","management mechanism","FAST mapping schemes","BAST mapping schemes"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["NAND flash memory","error correction codes","phase change memory"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6311327","doi":"10.1109/TCE.2012.6311327","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/30/6311306/06311327.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCE.2012.6311327","startPage":"849","endPage":"856","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6311306","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"PCRAM-assisted ECC management for enhanced data reliability in flash storage systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"PCRAM-assisted ECC management for enhanced data reliability in flash storage systems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6311327/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"August  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 September 2012","volume":"58","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/6311327/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"27 September 2012","publicationDate":"August 2012","accessionNumber":"13014824","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"PCRAM-assisted ECC management for enhanced data reliability in flash storage systems","sourcePdf":"p0849-lee.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.087226S","chronDate":"August  2012","xplore-pub-id":"30","isNumber":"6311306","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"30","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"6311306","articleId":"6311327","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6311328,"authors":[{"name":"Carlos R. del-Blanco","affiliation":["Grupo de Tratamiento de Im\u00e1genes, ETSI Telecomunicaci\u00f3n, Universidad Polit\u00e9cnica de Madrid, Madrid, Spain"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/30/6311306/6311328/6311328-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Carlos R. del Blanco received the Ph.D. degree with honors in Universidad Polit\u00e9cnica de Madrid (Spain) in 2011, and the \u201cIngeniero de Telecomunicaci\u00f3n\u201d degree with honors from Universidad Polit\u00e9cnica de Madrid (Spain) in 2005.

This is accomplished by a novel Bayesian tracking model that can manage multimodal distributions without explicitly computing the association between tracked objects and detections.

In this work, we present a novel depth video-based translation and scaling invariant human activity recognition (HAR) system utilizing R transformation of depth silhouettes. To perform HAR in indoor settings, an invariant HAR method is critical to freely perform activities anywhere in a camera view without translation and scaling problems of human body silhouettes. We obtain such invariant features via R transformation on depth silhouettes. Furthermore, in R transforming depth silhouettes, shape information of human body reflected in depth values is encoded into the features. In R transformation, 2D feature maps are computed first through Radon transform of each depth silhouette followed by computing 1D feature profile through R transform to get the translation and scaling invariant features. Then, we apply Principle Component Analysis (PCA) for dimension reduction and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) to make the features more prominent, compact and robust. Finally, Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) are used to train and recognize different human activities. Our proposed system shows superior recognition rate over the conventional approaches, reaching up to the mean recognition rate of 93.16% for six typical human activities whereas the conventional PC and IC-based depth silhouettes achieved only 74.83% and 86.33% ,while binary silhouettes-based R transformation approach achieved 67.08% respectively.

A candidate is chosen by minimum cost evaluation; cost is computed by spatial, color, and range weighting functions. Otherwise, the vacant pixel is replaced with a pixel estimated using bilinear interpolation to speed up the process. In terms of a trade-off between depth image quality and computational complexity, experimental results show that the proposed upsampler outperforms other conventional methods, such as the bilinear interpolator and joint bilateral upsampler.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6311344/","chronOrPublicationDate":"August  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 September 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6311344/","dateOfInsertion":"27 September 2012","publicationDate":"August 2012","accessionNumber":"13014833","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"58","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Fast edge-preserving depth image upsampler","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast edge-preserving depth image upsampler","sourcePdf":"p0971-kim.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.101086S","chronDate":"August  2012","xplore-pub-id":"30","isNumber":"6311306","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"30","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6311306","articleId":"6311344","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6311346,"authors":[{"name":"Demostenes Z.

In this paper, the different factors that degrade users' quality of experience (QoE) in video streaming service that use TCP as transmission protocol are studied. In this specific service, impairment factors are: number of pauses, their duration and temporal location. In order to measure the effect that each temporal segment has in the overall video quality, subjective tests. Because current subjective test methodologies are not adequate to assess video streaming over TCP, some recommendations are provided here. At the application layer, a customized player is used to evaluate the behavior of player buffer, and consequently, the end user QoE. Video subjective test results demonstrate that there is a close correlation between application parameters and subjective scores. Based on this fact, a new metrics named VsQM is defined, which considers the importance of temporal location of pauses to assess the user QoE of video streaming service. A useful application scenario is also presented, in which the metrics proposed herein is used to improve video services.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6311306","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCE.2012.6311346","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/30/6311306/06311346.pdf","startPage":"985","endPage":"992","doi":"10.1109/TCE.2012.6311346","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Quality metric to assess video streaming service over TCP considering temporal location of pauses","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"August  2012","displayDocTitle":"Quality metric to assess video streaming service over TCP considering temporal location of pauses","volume":"58","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/6311346/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"August 2012","accessionNumber":"13014834","dateOfInsertion":"27 September 2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6311346/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 September 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Quality metric to assess video streaming service over TCP considering temporal location of pauses","sourcePdf":"p0985-rodriguez.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.057337S","chronDate":"August  2012","xplore-pub-id":"30","isNumber":"6311306","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"30","citationCount":"40","xplore-issue":"6311306","articleId":"6311346","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-11"},{"_id":6311350,"authors":[{"name":"Byoung-Kyu Dan","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Korea University, Seoul, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/30/6311306/6311350/6311350-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Byoung-Kyu Dan received B.S. degree in Electronics Engineering from Korea University in 2006 and received M.S. degree in 2008.

Conventional algorithms utilize the monoscopic or stereoscopic vision data to count people. However, these vision-based people counting methods often fail due to occasional illumination change and crowded environment. In the proposed algorithm, both the top-view vision and depth images are captured by a video-plus-depth camera mounted on the ceiling. The depth image is first processed by a morphological operator to alleviate depth artifacts such as the optical noise and lost data. Then the human object is extracted using a human model from the preprocessed depth image. Finally, the trajectory of the detected object is established by applying the bidirectional matching algorithm. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm achieves over 98% accuracy in various testing environments.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6311350/","chronOrPublicationDate":"August  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 September 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"58","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"August 2012","dateOfInsertion":"27 September 2012","accessionNumber":"13014837","htmlLink":"/document/6311350/","displayDocTitle":"Robust people counting system based on sensor fusion","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust people counting system based on sensor fusion","sourcePdf":"p1013-dan.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.083797S","chronDate":"August  2012","xplore-pub-id":"30","isNumber":"6311306","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"30","citationCount":"34","xplore-issue":"6311306","articleId":"6311350","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6311398,"authors":[{"name":"Kan Yang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, City University of Hong Kong, Kowloon, Hong Kong, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/71/6570483/6311398/6311398-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Kan Yang received the BEng degree from the University of Science and Technology of China in 2008.

Due to the data outsourcing, however, this new paradigm of data hosting service also introduces new security challenges, which requires an independent auditing service to check the data integrity in the cloud. Some existing remote integrity checking methods can only serve for static archive data and, thus, cannot be applied to the auditing service since the data in the cloud can be dynamically updated. Thus, an efficient and secure dynamic auditing protocol is desired to convince data owners that the data are correctly stored in the cloud. In this paper, we first design an auditing framework for cloud storage systems and propose an efficient and privacy-preserving auditing protocol. Then, we extend our auditing protocol to support the data dynamic operations, which is efficient and provably secure in the random oracle model. We further extend our auditing protocol to support batch auditing for both multiple owners and multiple clouds, without using any trusted organizer. The analysis and simulation results show that our proposed auditing protocols are secure and efficient, especially it reduce the computation cost of the auditor.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/71/6570483/06311398.pdf","startPage":"1717","endPage":"1726","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Efficient and Secure Dynamic Auditing Protocol for Data Storage in Cloud Computing","doi":"10.1109/TPDS.2012.278","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6570483","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPDS.2012.278","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6311398","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6311398/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 September 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2013","displayDocTitle":"An Efficient and Secure Dynamic Auditing Protocol for Data Storage in Cloud Computing","dateOfInsertion":"26 July 2013","publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","accessionNumber":"13656080","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"24","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/6311398/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Efficient and Secure Dynamic Auditing Protocol for Data Storage in Cloud Computing","sourcePdf":"ttd2013091717.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.094633S","chronDate":"Sept.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"71","isNumber":"6570483","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"71","citationCount":"322","xplore-issue":"6570483","articleId":"6311398","onlineDate":"24 September 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":6311400,"authors":[{"name":"Hamzeh Khazaei","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Manitoba, Toronto, ONT, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/71/6613497/6311400/6311400-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Hamzeh Khazaei received the BS and MS degrees in computer science from Amirkabir University of Technology (Tehran Polytechnic), Iran, in 2004 and 2008, respectively.

Also, our results reveal important insights for capacity planning to control delay of servicing users requests.","doi":"10.1109/TPDS.2012.280","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/71/6613497/06311400.pdf","startPage":"2138","endPage":"2147","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPDS.2012.280","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6613497","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6311400","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Fine-Grained Performance Model of Cloud Computing Centers","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 September 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6311400/","displayDocTitle":"A Fine-Grained Performance Model of Cloud Computing Centers","volume":"24","issue":"11","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6311400/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2013","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"27 September 2013","accessionNumber":"13796301","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Fine-Grained Performance Model of Cloud Computing Centers","sourcePdf":"ttd2013112138.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.101508S","chronDate":"Nov.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"71","isNumber":"6613497","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"71","citationCount":"73","xplore-issue":"6613497","articleId":"6311400","onlineDate":"24 September 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6311403,"authors":[{"name":"Zhen Xiao","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Peking University, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/71/6507529/6311403/6311403-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Zhen Xiao is a professor in the Department of Computer Science at Peking University.

Many of the touted gains in the cloud model come from resource multiplexing through virtualization technology. In this paper, we present a system that uses virtualization technology to allocate data center resources dynamically based on application demands and support green computing by optimizing the number of servers in use. We introduce the concept of \"skewness\u201d to measure the unevenness in the multidimensional resource utilization of a server. By minimizing skewness, we can combine different types of workloads nicely and improve the overall utilization of server resources. We develop a set of heuristics that prevent overload in the system effectively while saving energy used. Trace driven simulation and experiment results demonstrate that our algorithm achieves good performance.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/71/6507529/06311403.pdf","startPage":"1107","endPage":"1117","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPDS.2012.283","doi":"10.1109/TPDS.2012.283","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6507529","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamic Resource Allocation Using Virtual Machines for Cloud Computing Environment","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 September 2012","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic Resource Allocation Using Virtual Machines for Cloud Computing Environment","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6311403/","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6311403/","dateOfInsertion":"24 April 2013","publicationDate":"June 2013","accessionNumber":"13457189","volume":"24","issue":"6","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2013","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic Resource Allocation Using Virtual Machines for Cloud Computing Environment","sourcePdf":"ttd2013061107.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.052363S","chronDate":"June  2013","xplore-pub-id":"71","isNumber":"6507529","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"71","citationCount":"473","xplore-issue":"6507529","articleId":"6311403","onlineDate":"24 September 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6311406,"authors":[{"name":"Feng Yan","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA"],"firstName":"Feng","lastName":"Yan","id":"37074760100"},{"name":"Shreyas Sundaram","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Waterloo, ONT, Canada"],"bio":{"p":["Feng Yan received the BS degree in mathematics and physics from the School of Science, Tsinghua University.

The sequential nature of online learning, however, requires a centralized learner to store data and update parameters. In this paper, we consider online learning with distributed data sources. The autonomous learners update local parameters based on local data sources and periodically exchange information with a small subset of neighbors in a communication network. We derive the regret bound for strongly convex functions that generalizes the work by Ram et al. for convex functions. More importantly, we show that our algorithm has intrinsic privacy-preserving properties, and we prove the sufficient and necessary conditions for privacy preservation in the network. These conditions imply that for networks with greater-than-one connectivity, a malicious learner cannot reconstruct the subgradients (and sensitive raw data) of other learners, which makes our algorithm appealing in privacy-sensitive applications.","doi":"10.1109/TKDE.2012.191","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/69/6604395/06311406.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TKDE.2012.191","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6604395","startPage":"2483","endPage":"2493","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed Autonomous Online Learning: Regrets and Intrinsic Privacy-Preserving Properties","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6311406","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Distributed Autonomous Online Learning: Regrets and Intrinsic Privacy-Preserving Properties","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6311406/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 September 2012","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"25","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 2013","accessionNumber":"13795095","dateOfInsertion":"19 September 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6311406/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed Autonomous Online Learning: Regrets and Intrinsic Privacy-Preserving Properties","sourcePdf":"ttk2013112483.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.101461S","chronDate":"Nov.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"69","isNumber":"6604395","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"69","citationCount":"96","xplore-issue":"6604395","articleId":"6311406","onlineDate":"24 September 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-02"},{"_id":6311409,"authors":[{"name":"Martin P.

Our survey provides a synthesis of this complex technical field along different dimensions of analysis: properties inferred, mining techniques, and empirical results.

In an anechoic environment we find that the performance of the SHD MVDR beamformer with an open array depends almost entirely on the number of microphones, as in the spatial domain.","doi":"10.1109/LSP.2012.2220351","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/97/6296742/06311426.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6296742","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LSP.2012.2220351","publicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","startPage":"773","endPage":"776","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Noise Reduction Performance of a Spherical Harmonic Domain Tradeoff Beamformer","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6311426","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 September 2012","displayDocTitle":"On the Noise Reduction Performance of a Spherical Harmonic Domain Tradeoff Beamformer","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6311426/","volume":"19","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/6311426/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2012","accessionNumber":"13028063","dateOfInsertion":"03 October 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Noise Reduction Performance of a Spherical Harmonic Domain Tradeoff Beamformer","sourcePdf":"lsp-jarrett-2220351-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.069808S","chronDate":"Nov.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"97","isNumber":"6296742","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"97","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"6296742","articleId":"6311426","onlineDate":"24 September 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6311430,"authors":[{"name":"Pai-Yen Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8/6493417/6311430/6311430-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Pai-Yen Chen (S'09) was born in Taiwan on September 19, 1982.

This may enable the realization of THz electronic switches and tunable loaded-lines for sub mm-wave antenna systems. Based on these active components, we theoretically and numerically demonstrate several digital and analog phase shifter designs for THz frequencies, with a wide range of phase shifts and small return loss, insertion loss and phase error. The proposed graphene-based phase shifters show significant advantages over other available technology in this frequency range, as they combine the low-loss and compact-size features of GPPWGs with electrically-programmable phase tuning.

The goal of the approach is to synthesize a controller that achieves both good dynamic performance and low harmonic distortion at steady state. The suggested control approach takes the switched nature of the converter into account in both the system model and the control objective. This has two main advantages. First, it removes the need for the low-pass filters which are conventionally applied to the state measurements to attenuate the switching ripple. This implies that improved dynamic performance can be obtained. Second, it penalizes the ripple deviation from the reference, which means that reduced harmonic distortion can be obtained at steady state.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Switches","Data models","Inverters","Voltage control","Harmonic distortion","Pulse width modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["control system synthesis","predictive control","PWM invertors","sampled data systems","switching convertors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hybrid sampled data model predictive control","voltage source inverter","switched mode power converters","controller synthesis","steady state","system model","control objective","dynamic performance improvement","ripple deviation penalization","harmonic distortion reduction","steady state"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Inductance-capacitor-inductance (LCL) filter","model predictive control (MPC)","optimal pulse-width modulation (PWM)","sampled data model","switched mode power converter"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TCST.2012.2214777","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/87/6578094/06311438.pdf","startPage":"1907","endPage":"1915","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6578094","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCST.2012.2214777","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sampled Data Model Predictive Control of a Voltage Source Inverter for Reduced Harmonic Distortion","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6311438","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Sampled Data Model Predictive Control of a Voltage Source Inverter for Reduced Harmonic Distortion","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6311438/","volume":"21","issue":"5","publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6311438/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"13706143","dateOfInsertion":"16 August 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 September 2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sampled Data Model Predictive Control of a Voltage Source Inverter for Reduced Harmonic Distortion","sourcePdf":"tcst-almer-2214777-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.054771S","chronDate":"Sept.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"87","isNumber":"6578094","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"87","citationCount":"47","xplore-issue":"6578094","articleId":"6311438","onlineDate":"24 September 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6311439,"authors":[{"name":"Serge L.

The approach is based on the alternative sensing-paradigm of compressed sensing (CS). The hardware platform features a fully-integrated CS receiver architecture named the random-modulation preintegrator (RMPI) fabricated in Northrop Grumman's 450 nm InP HBT bipolar technology. The software back-end consists of a novel CS parameter recovery algorithm which extracts information about the signal without performing full time-domain signal reconstruction. This approach significantly reduces the computational overhead involved in retrieving desired information which demonstrates an avenue toward employing CS techniques in power-constrained real-time applications. The developed techniques are validated on CS samples physically measured by the fabricated RMPI and measurement results are presented. The parameter estimation algorithms are described in detail and a complete description of the physical hardware is given.","doi":"10.1109/JETCAS.2012.2214634","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Emerging and Selected Topics in Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Emerging and Selected Topics in Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5503868/6374660/06311440.pdf","startPage":"626","endPage":"638","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JETCAS.2012.2214634","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6374660","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Compressed Sensing Parameter Extraction Platform for Radar Pulse Signal Acquisition","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6311440","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 September 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6311440/","displayDocTitle":"A Compressed Sensing Parameter Extraction Platform for Radar Pulse Signal Acquisition","volume":"2","issue":"3","publicationDate":"Sept. 2012","accessionNumber":"13167801","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6311440/","dateOfInsertion":"27 December 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Compressed Sensing Parameter Extraction Platform for Radar Pulse Signal Acquisition","sourcePdf":"jetcas-yoo-2214634-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.193498S","chronDate":"Sept.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"5503868","isNumber":"6374660","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5503868","citationCount":"59","xplore-issue":"6374660","articleId":"6311440","onlineDate":"24 September 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6311441,"authors":[{"name":"Hegong Wei","affiliation":["The State Key Laboratory of Analog andMixed Signal VLSI, Faculty of Science and Technology, University of Macau, Macao, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/6339059/6311441/6311441-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Hegong Wei (S'05\u2013M'10) received the B.Sc., M.Sc., and Ph.D. degrees (with honors) in electrical and electronics engineering from the University of Macau, Macao, China, in 2006, 2008, and 2011, respectively.","He was a Project Leader with the State Key Laboratory of Analog and Mixed-Signal VLSI, University of Macau, Macao, China.

The active area with the digital calibration is 0.028 mm\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n.","doi":"10.1109/JSSC.2012.2214181","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSSC.2012.2214181","startPage":"2763","endPage":"2772","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel5/4/6339059/06311441.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6339059","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An 8-b 400-MS/s 2-b-Per-Cycle SAR ADC With Resistive DAC","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6311441/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 September 2012","displayDocTitle":"An 8-b 400-MS/s 2-b-Per-Cycle SAR ADC With Resistive DAC","volume":"47","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"24 October 2012","accessionNumber":"13100288","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6311441/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"T","title":"An 8-b 400-MS/s 2-b-Per-Cycle SAR ADC With Resistive DAC","sourcePdf":"jssc-wei-2214181-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.088756S","chronDate":"Nov.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"4","isNumber":"6339059","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"60","xplore-issue":"6339059","articleId":"6311441","onlineDate":"24 September 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6311442,"authors":[{"name":"Yen-Ju Lu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and the Graduate Institute of Communication Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yen-Ju","lastName":"Lu","id":"37539052400"},{"name":"Shih-Yuan Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and the Graduate Institute of Communication Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Shih-Yuan","lastName":"Chen","id":"37277596400"},{"name":"Powen Hsu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and the Graduate Institute of Communication Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Powen","lastName":"Hsu","id":"37276890700"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1531-1309"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-1764"}],"articleNumber":"6311442","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":99,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2230},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society","url":"http://www.mtt.org/"}],"abstract":"A novel design of a differential-mode (DM) wideband bandpass filter (BPF) with enhanced common-mode (CM) suppression using a slotline resonator is presented. The BPF consists of two pairs of parallel microstrip transmission lines, a pair of transverse microstrip sections connected to the transmission lines, and a longitudinal slotline resonator placed in the ground plane. With proper placement of the slotline resonator, the mode coupling between the slotline mode and the (DM) signals can be maximized, while that between the slotline mode and the CM signals can be minimized. It is found that throughout the (DM) passband, the insertion loss of the CM signals is higher than 47.5 dB, the fractional bandwidth defined by the 10 dB return loss for the (DM) signals is about 105%, and the insertion loss for the (DM) signals ranges from 1.22 to 5.82 dB over the fractional bandwidth. Good agreement between simulated and measured results is obtained.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Microwave and Wireless Components Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/7260/6320642/06311442.pdf","startPage":"503","endPage":"505","publicationTitle":"IEEE Microwave and Wireless Components Letters","doi":"10.1109/LMWC.2012.2218279","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LMWC.2012.2218279","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6320642","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6311442","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Differential-Mode Wideband Bandpass Filter With Enhanced Common-Mode Suppression Using Slotline Resonator","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Slotline","Band pass filters","Microstrip","Transmission line measurements","Loss measurement","Wideband"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["band-pass filters","microstrip lines","microstrip resonators","resonator filters","slot line components","transmission lines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["differential-mode wideband bandpass filter","common-mode suppression","DM BPF","parallel microstrip transmission line","transverse microstrip section","longitudinal slotline resonator","mode coupling","slotline mode","DM signal","CM signal","DM passband","insertion loss","fractional bandwidth","loss 10 dB","loss 1.22 dB to 5.82 dB"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Differential-mode (DM) bandpass filters (BPFs)","microstrip-to-slotline transitions","slotline resonators"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6311442/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 September 2012","displayDocTitle":"A Differential-Mode Wideband Bandpass Filter With Enhanced Common-Mode Suppression Using Slotline Resonator","volume":"22","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/6311442/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2012","accessionNumber":"13030354","dateOfInsertion":"03 October 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Differential-Mode Wideband Bandpass Filter With Enhanced Common-Mode Suppression Using Slotline Resonator","sourcePdf":"lmwc-chen-2218279-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044844S","chronDate":"Oct.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"7260","isNumber":"6320642","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7260","citationCount":"99","xplore-issue":"6320642","articleId":"6311442","onlineDate":"24 September 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-29"},{"_id":6311443,"authors":[{"name":"Runqi Zhang","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Runqi","lastName":"Zhang","id":"38245436500"},{"name":"Lei Zhu","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Lei","lastName":"Zhu","id":"37276565500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1531-1309"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-1764"}],"articleNumber":"6311443","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":28,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1822},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society","url":"http://www.mtt.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Band pass filters","Impedance","Wideband","Passband","Wireless communication","Couplings","Insertion loss"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["band-pass filters","resonator filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wideband bandpass filter","inductively coupled short-circuited multimode resonator","wideband BPF","MMR","cascaded transmission lines","inductive coupling element","filter design","transfer function","frequency response","equal-ripple in-band response","fifth-order ultra-wide filter"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Multi-mode resonator (MMR)","synthesis design","wideband and ultra-wide bandpass filter (BPF)"]}],"abstract":"In this letter, a class of wideband bandpass filters (BPFs) with short-circuited multi-mode resonators (MMRs) is proposed and designed by a synthesis approach.

A local controller on each bus of the network monitors the bus voltage and, whenever there is a voltage violation, it uses locally available information to estimate the amount of reactive power that needs to be injected into the bus in order to correct the violation. If the DERs connected to the bus can collectively provide the reactive power estimated by the local controller, they are instructed to do so. Otherwise, the local controller initiates a request for additional reactive power support from other controllers at neighboring buses through a distributed algorithm that relies on a local exchange of information among neighboring controllers. We show that the proposed architecture helps prevent voltage violations and shapes the voltage profile in radial distribution networks, even in the presence of considerable penetration of variable generation and loads. We present several case studies involving 8-, 13-, and 123-bus distribution systems to illustrate the operation of the architecture.","doi":"10.1109/TPWRS.2012.2211385","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/59/6504806/06311449.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRS.2012.2211385","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6504806","startPage":"1470","endPage":"1482","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Two-Stage Distributed Architecture for Voltage Control in Power Distribution Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6311449","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Two-Stage Distributed Architecture for Voltage Control in Power Distribution Systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6311449/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 September 2012","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"28","issue":"2","publicationDate":"May 2013","accessionNumber":"13934139","dateOfInsertion":"18 April 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6311449/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Two-Stage Distributed Architecture for Voltage Control in Power Distribution Systems","sourcePdf":"tpwrs-dominguezgarcia-2211385-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.083665S","chronDate":"May  2013","xplore-pub-id":"59","isNumber":"6504806","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"198","xplore-issue":"6504806","articleId":"6311449","onlineDate":"24 September 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-22"},{"_id":6311450,"authors":[{"name":"Suresh Gautam","affiliation":["Klipsch School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, New Mexico State University, Las Cruces, NM, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/59/6504806/6311450/6311450-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Suresh Gautam (S'08) received the Bachelor of Engineering degree and the Master of Science degree in electrical engineering from the Institute of Engineering, Tribhuvan University, Nepal, in 2002 and 2007, respectively, and the Master of Science degree in electrical engineering from New Mexico State University, Las Cruces, in 2010, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree.","From 2002 to 2004, he was with Kathmandu Engineering College, Kathmandu, Nepal, as a lecturer.

The effectiveness of the method is demonstrated by designing power oscillation damping (POD) controllers for single-, four-, and 16-machine power system models.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6504806","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRS.2012.2215348","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/59/6504806/06311451.pdf","startPage":"1599","endPage":"1608","doi":"10.1109/TPWRS.2012.2215348","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust and Low Order Power Oscillation Damper Design Through Polynomial Control","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2013","displayDocTitle":"Robust and Low Order Power Oscillation Damper Design Through Polynomial Control","volume":"28","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/6311451/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 2013","accessionNumber":"13969309","dateOfInsertion":"18 April 2013","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6311451/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 September 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust and Low Order Power Oscillation Damper Design Through Polynomial Control","sourcePdf":"tpwrs-pal-2215348-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.066073S","chronDate":"May  2013","xplore-pub-id":"59","isNumber":"6504806","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"6504806","articleId":"6311451","onlineDate":"24 September 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":6311454,"authors":[{"name":"Zhi Chen","affiliation":["The Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, Clarkson University, Potsdam, NY, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Zhi Chen (S'11) received his B.E. degree in electronic science and technology from Wuhan University, China, in 2009, and the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from Polytechnic Institute of New York University, in 2011.

The proposed real-time price-based DR management application can be imbedded into smart meters and automatically executed on-line for determining the optimal operation of residential appliances within 5-minute time slots while considering uncertainties in real-time electricity prices. Operation tasks of residential appliances are categorized into deferrable/non-deferrable and interruptible/non-interruptible ones based on appliances' DR preferences as well as their distinct spatial and temporal operation characteristics. The stochastic optimization adopts the scenario-based approach via Monte Carlo (MC) simulation for minimizing the expected electricity payment for the entire day, while controlling the financial risks associated with real-time electricity price uncertainties via the expected downside risks formulation. Price uncertainty intervals are considered in the robust optimization for minimizing the worst-case electricity payment while flexibly adjusting the solution robustness. Both approaches are formulated as mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) problems and solved by state-of-the-art MILP solvers. The numerical results show attributes of the two approaches for solving the real-time optimal DR management problem for residential appliances.","doi":"10.1109/TSG.2012.2212729","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid","pdfPath":"/iel5/5165411/6397636/06311454.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSG.2012.2212729","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6397636","startPage":"1822","endPage":"1831","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Real-Time Price-Based Demand Response Management for Residential Appliances via Stochastic Optimization and Robust Optimization","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6311454","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Real-Time Price-Based Demand Response Management for Residential Appliances via Stochastic Optimization and Robust Optimization","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6311454/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 September 2012","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"3","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","accessionNumber":"13190979","dateOfInsertion":"28 December 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6311454/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Real-Time Price-Based Demand Response Management for Residential Appliances via Stochastic Optimization and Robust Optimization","sourcePdf":"tsg-wu-2212729-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.080214S","chronDate":"Dec.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"5165411","isNumber":"6397636","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5165411","citationCount":"487","xplore-issue":"6397636","articleId":"6311454","onlineDate":"24 September 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-22"},{"_id":6311456,"authors":[{"name":"Mayank Shrivastava","affiliation":["Intel Mobile Communications GmbH, Munich, Germany"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7298/6365827/6311456/6311456-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Mayank Shrivastava (S'09\u2013M'10) received the B.S. degree in engineering from Rajiv Gandhi Technical University, Bhopal, India, in 2006 and the Ph.D. degree from the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Bombay, Mumbai, India, in 2010.","From April 2008 to October 2008 and again in May 2010 to July 2010, he was a Visiting Research Scholar with Infineon Technologies AG, Munich, Germany.

However, estimating the number of endmembers, which is usually assumed to be known a priori in most endmember estimation algorithms (EEAs), still remains a challenging task. In this paper, assuming hyperspectral linear mixing model, we propose a hyperspectral data geometry-based approach for estimating the number of endmembers by utilizing successive endmember estimation strategy of an EEA. The approach is fulfilled by two novel algorithms, namely geometry-based estimation of number of endmembers\u2014convex hull (GENE-CH) algorithm and affine hull (GENE-AH) algorithm. The GENE-CH and GENE-AH algorithms are based on the fact that all the observed pixel vectors lie in the convex hull and affine hull of the endmember signatures, respectively. The proposed GENE algorithms estimate the number of endmembers by using the Neyman\u2013Pearson hypothesis testing over the endmember estimates provided by a successive EEA until the estimate of the number of endmembers is obtained. Since the estimation accuracies of the proposed GENE algorithms depend on the performance of the EEA used, a reliable, reproducible, and successive EEA, called \n<formula formulatype=\"inline\" xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex Notation=\"TeX\">$p$</tex></formula>\n-norm-based pure pixel identification (TRI-P) algorithm is then proposed.

Since different sea ice types can have similar backscattering coefficients at C-band HH polarization, it is necessary to use textural features in addition to the backscattering coefficients. The analysis revealed that the most informative texture features for the classification of multiyear ice (MYI), deformed first-year ice (FYI) (DFYI), and level FYI (LFYI) and open water/nilas are correlation, inertia, cluster prominence, energy, homogeneity, and entropy, as well as third and fourth central statistical moments of image brightness. The optimal topology of the NN, trained for ENVISAT wide-swath SAR sea ice classification, consists of nine neurons in input layer, six neurons in hidden layer, and three neurons in output layer. The classification results for a series of 20 SAR images, acquired in the central part of the Arctic Ocean during winter months, were compared to expert analysis of the images and ice charts. The results of the NN classification show that the average correspondences with the expert analysis amount to 85 \n<formula formulatype=\"inline\" xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex Notation=\"TeX\">$\\%$</tex></formula>\n, 83\n<formula formulatype=\"inline\" xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex Notation=\"TeX\">$\\%$</tex></formula>\n, and 80\n<formula formulatype=\"inline\" xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex Notation=\"TeX\">$\\%$</tex></formula>\n for LFYI, DFYI, and MYI, respectively.

For proper functioning of such systems good pulsewidth modulation (PWM) strategy is of crucial importance. Control complexity of multiphase multilevel inverters increases rapidly with an increase in the number of phases and the number of levels. This paper deals with a three-level neutral point clamped (NPC) inverter supplied five-phase induction motor drive and analyses five PWM strategies: three are carrier-based (CBPWM) and two are space vector based (SVPWM). The aim is to provide a detailed comparison and thus conclude on pros and cons of each solution, providing a guideline for the selection of the most appropriate PWM technique. Experimental results are provided for all analysed PWM methods. The comparison of the PWM techniques is given in terms of the voltage and current waveforms and spectra, as well as the total harmonic distortion (THD) in a whole linear modulation index range, which is used as the global figure of merit. Properties of the common mode voltage (CMV) are also investigated. Complexity of the algorithms, in terms of the computational time requirements and memory consumption, is addressed as well. It is shown that the performance of the PWM techniques is very similar and that one CBPWM and one SVPWM technique are characterised with identical performance. However, using the algorithm complexity as the main criterion, space vector techniques are more involved.","doi":"10.1109/TII.2012.2220553","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TII.2012.2220553","startPage":"609","endPage":"619","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics","pdfPath":"/iel5/9424/6409420/06311465.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6409420","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Comparison of Carrier-Based and Space Vector PWM Techniques for Three-Level Five-Phase Voltage Source Inverters","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 September 2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2013","displayDocTitle":"A Comparison of Carrier-Based and Space Vector PWM Techniques for Three-Level Five-Phase Voltage Source Inverters","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2013","dateOfInsertion":"11 January 2013","volume":"9","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6311465/","accessionNumber":"13220085","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6311465/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Comparison of Carrier-Based and Space Vector PWM Techniques for Three-Level Five-Phase Voltage Source Inverters","sourcePdf":"tii-levi-2220553-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.086831S","chronDate":"May  2013","xplore-pub-id":"9424","isNumber":"6409420","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9424","citationCount":"109","xplore-issue":"6409420","articleId":"6311465","onlineDate":"24 September 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-12"},{"_id":6311466,"authors":[{"name":"Matthias Preindl","affiliation":["Department of Industrial Engineering, University of Padova, Padova, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/9424/6409420/6311466/6311466-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Matthias Preindl was born in Brixen, Italy, in 1986.

The controller is of the finite control set (FCS) type, which takes the discrete states of the voltage source inverter (VSI) into account. Each sampling period, the future behavior of the plant is predicted and inputs (voltage vectors) are selected using an optimization criterion, i.e., a cost function. Optimization, however, depend on the operation region. Maximum torque per ampere (MTPA) tracking for high electrical efficiency is aimed below rated speed, operation off the MTPA trajectory is necessary for obtaining field-weakening. In this work, a cost function is designed, which is suitable for operation at high speeds without penalizing operation below rated speed. MP-DTC is applied to permanent magnet synchronous machine (PMSM) drive systems. High control performances, i.e., dynamics, is obtained without increasing the switching frequency nor reducing significantly the torque quality. This feature is interesting above all for high power applications. The proposed control strategy has been evaluated on a small-scale (PMSM) drive system with two-level VSI for demonstration showing promising results.","doi":"10.1109/TII.2012.2220353","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics","pdfPath":"/iel5/9424/6409420/06311466.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TII.2012.2220353","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6409420","startPage":"648","endPage":"657","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Model Predictive Direct Torque Control With Finite Control Set for PMSM Drive Systems, Part 2: Field Weakening Operation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6311466","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Model Predictive Direct Torque Control With Finite Control Set for PMSM Drive Systems, Part 2: Field Weakening Operation","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6311466/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 September 2012","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"9","issue":"2","publicationDate":"May 2013","accessionNumber":"13220086","dateOfInsertion":"11 January 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6311466/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Model Predictive Direct Torque Control With Finite Control Set for PMSM Drive Systems, Part 2: Field Weakening Operation","sourcePdf":"tii-preindl-2220353-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.075926S","chronDate":"May  2013","xplore-pub-id":"9424","isNumber":"6409420","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9424","citationCount":"159","xplore-issue":"6409420","articleId":"6311466","onlineDate":"24 September 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6311471,"authors":[{"name":"Ronit Bustin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Technion-Israel Institute of Technology, Technion City, Haifa, Israel"],"firstName":"Ronit","lastName":"Bustin","id":"37546631400"},{"name":"Shlomo Shamai","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Technion-Israel Institute of Technology, Technion City, Haifa, Israel"],"firstName":"Shlomo","lastName":"Shamai","id":"37267375900"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9448"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9654"}],"articleNumber":"6311471","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":14,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":488},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Information Theory Society","url":"http://www.itsoc.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6311471","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Signal to noise ratio","Mutual information","Receivers","Interference channels","Decoding","Optimization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["AWGN channels","channel coding","error statistics","least mean squares methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["minimum mean square error methods","bad codes","additive Gaussian noise channel","reliable communication","signal-to-noise ratio","point-to-point capacity","nonoptimal codes","superposition codebooks","mutual information behavior","finite length codes","error probability","MMSE contrained codes"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Bad codes","disturbance","Gaussian channel","I-MMSE","interference","MMSE constrained codes","nonoptimal codes","superposition codebooks"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6413249","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2012.2220518","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MMSE of \u201cBad\u201d Codes","startPage":"733","endPage":"743","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/6413249/06311471.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2012.2220518","abstract":"We examine codes, over the additive Gaussian noise channel, designed for reliable communication at some specific signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and constrained by the permitted minimum mean-square error (MMSE) at lower SNRs.

With full knowledge of the CSI, the receiver should compute the optimal beamforming vectors, jointly quantize them, and feed them back to the transmitter. The achievable forward data rate depends on the rate of the feedback link. The optimal tradeoff between the forward and feedback rates is characterized using rate distortion theory in the limit of infinite number of subcarriers with fixed amount of feedback per subcarrier. The distortion metric is the difference between the forward rate achieved with limited feedback and the capacity with perfect CSI at the transmitter. The rate distortion function gives the forward rate as a function of the feedback rate. Numerical results show that to achieve a target forward rate, the required feedback rate can be substantially reduced by joint quantization of the beamformers across subcarriers. A simple quantizer amenable to practical implementation is shown to approach the rate distortion bound with near-linear computational complexity.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6311475/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 September 2012","volume":"59","issue":"2","accessionNumber":"13234716","publicationDate":"Feb. 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6311475/","dateOfInsertion":"16 January 2013","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Multicarrier Beamforming With Limited Feedback: A Rate Distortion Approach","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multicarrier Beamforming With Limited Feedback: A Rate Distortion Approach","sourcePdf":"tit-xu-2220517-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.074677S","chronDate":"Feb.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"6413249","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6413249","articleId":"6311475","onlineDate":"24 September 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6311529,"authors":[{"name":"A.

Thermal and curing studies were performed using Thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA) and Differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) respectively. The new compound was used as a curing agent for thermosetting epoxy resin Diglycidyl ether of Bispheol-A (DGEBA). The in built phenolic moiety accelerates the curing rate along with the amines thereby relatively lowering the curing temperature compared to the commercial aromatic curing agent such as diamino diphenyl ether (DDE) and also gives longer pot life compared to aliphatic amine such as triethyltriamine (TETRA). Cured polymer of DGEBA/APHCTA showed lower glass transition temperature(Tg) which imparts the flexibility and it also exhibits good thermal stability up to 340 \u00b0C. Activation energy (E\u03b1) based on model free kinetics (MFK) method indicates the extent of curing of the reaction. Isothermal curing thermogram showed that the resin cures at lower temperature. Electrochemical Impedance study for the cured film of DGEBA/APHCTA coated on the copper plate exhibits good corrosion inhibition. The new curing agent containing amines, phenolic and thiourea is a potential candidate for use as a latent curing agent for single part epoxy resin for impregnation of AC motor rotors and stators.","doi":"10.1109/TDEI.2012.6311529","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6311485","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TDEI.2012.6311529","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Dielectrics and Electrical Insulation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Dielectrics and Electrical Insulation","pdfPath":"/iel5/94/6311485/06311529.pdf","startPage":"1791","endPage":"1798","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Novel latent epoxy curing agent for secondary insulation in electrical rotors and stators","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 October 2012","displayDocTitle":"Novel latent epoxy curing agent for secondary insulation in electrical rotors and stators","volume":"19","issue":"5","chronOrPublicationDate":"October  2012","dateOfInsertion":"02 October 2012","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6311529/","publicationDate":"October 2012","accessionNumber":"13030095","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6311529/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Novel latent epoxy curing agent for secondary insulation in electrical rotors and stators","sourcePdf":"p1791-burkanudeen.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.09821S","chronDate":"October  2012","xplore-pub-id":"94","isNumber":"6311485","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"94","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"6311485","articleId":"6311529","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6311637,"authors":[{"name":"Chao Yang","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Information Engineering, Surveying,  Mapping and Remote Sensing, Wuhan University of China, Wuhan, Hubei, China"],"firstName":"Chao","lastName":"Yang","id":"37537198200"},{"name":"Yuanzheng Shao","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Information Engineering, Surveying,  Mapping and Remote Sensing, Wuhan University of China, Wuhan, Hubei, China"],"firstName":"Yuanzheng","lastName":"Shao","id":"37593078200"},{"name":"Nengcheng Chen","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Information Engineering, Surveying,  Mapping and Remote Sensing, Wuhan University of China, Wuhan, Hubei, China"],"firstName":"Nengcheng","lastName":"Chen","id":"37538739200"},{"name":"Liping Di","affiliation":["Center for Spatial Information Science and Systems (CSISS), George Mason University, Fairfax, VA, USA"],"firstName":"Liping","lastName":"Di","id":"37305594100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2496-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2495-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2494-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6311637","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":303},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cloud computing","Geospatial analysis","Simple object access protocol","Vegetation mapping","XML","Remote sensing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["agriculture","cloud computing","crops","geophysics computing","Web services"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dynamic agro-geoinformation processing","OGC Web services","online geospatial data","top-to-end operational unit","Internet","computational Web resources","cloud computing technology application","agriculture geospatial information research field","Web processing services","WPS environment","Amazon cloud computing platform","normalized difference vegetation index value","crop condition","NDVI"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cloud Computing","OGC","WPS","NDVI","Agro-geoinformation"]}],"abstract":"How to evaluate all sorts of heterogeneously online geospatial web resources (e.g., OGC web services, online geospatial data) as a top-to end operational unit is a main geospatial research topic in this period.

The cross-correlation coefficient is a measure of the similarity between two variables. The change detection problem can be understood as the process to partition two input images into two distinct regions, namely \u201cchanged\u201d and \u201cunchanged\u201d, according to the binary change detection mask. Each region in the pair of the images of the corresponding position is considered as two sets of variables, whose cross-correlation coefficient is calculated in order to provide an optimal partition of the changed and unchanged regions. In the optimal partition, it is obvious that the cross-correlation coefficient of the set of the unchanged variables should be the maximum, while the absolute-value of that of the changed variables should be the minimum, because the corresponding unchanged regions are similar while the changed regions are quite different. Genetic Algorithm is used to obtain the optimal non-dominated solution as the change detection using cross-correlation coefficient is a multi-objective optimization problem. The simulation experiment shows that the result using the new method is effective and robust to radiometric difference.","doi":"10.1109/Agro-Geoinformatics.2012.6311693","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"2012 First International Conference on Agro- Geoinformatics (Agro-Geoinformatics)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/Agro-Geoinformatics.2012.6311693","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6311594","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 First International Conference on Agro- Geoinformatics (Agro-Geoinformatics)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6301983/6311594/06311693.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Image change detection based on cross-correlation coefficient by using Genetic Algorithm","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6311693/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Image change detection based on cross-correlation coefficient by using Genetic Algorithm","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6311693/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"13035131","publicationDate":"Aug. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"27 September 2012","conferenceDate":"2-4 Aug. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 Aug. 2012","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Image change detection based on cross-correlation coefficient by using Genetic Algorithm","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"agrogeoinfo2012submission54.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07221S","chronDate":"2-4 Aug. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6301983","isNumber":"6311594","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6301983","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6311594","articleId":"6311693","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":6311821,"authors":[{"name":"Charles M.

The authors have monitored the pricing trends of DRAM chips in the past 14 years and observed a surprisingly regular behaviour in the rate of price reduction and in the time interval of introducing a new DRAM with a 4:1 density improvement. They have found that the initial high price of a new DRAM declines rapidly with a rate |\n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">dP</i>\n/\n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">dt</i>\n| much larger than $1/year, where \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">P</i>\n is the average price per packaged DRAM chip in dollars and \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">t</i>\n is the time in years. The rate approaches $1/year at a price level of about $3. This price level is of critical importance because it corresponds to the peak volume of DRAM shipment as well as the maximum return on investment of the DRAM project. This price level is designated the \u03c0 level because the transcendental number \u03c0 has a value fairly close to three. Beyond the \u03c0 level, the price continues to decline and eventually settles at a level corresponding to about one-half the price at \u03c0 level, i.e. $\u03c0/2. The illustration may also be used as a reference for the pricing trends of static random-access memories (SRAM). A SRAM with a given number of bits is approximately four times more complex than a DRAM having the same number of bits. Therefore, for SRAMs, the pricing curves will be shifted by one generation.","doi":"10.1109/MCD.1985.6311924","publicationTitle":"IEEE Circuits and Devices Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Circuits and Devices Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel5/101/6311914/06311924.pdf","startPage":"53","endPage":"54","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MCD.1985.6311924","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6311914","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"DRAM pricing trends \u2014 The \u03c0 rule","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1985","displayDocTitle":"DRAM pricing trends \u2014 The \u03c0 rule","volume":"1","issue":"1","dateOfInsertion":"25 September 2012","accessionNumber":"2478685","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 1985","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6311924/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1985","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"DRAM pricing trends \u2014 The \u03c0 rule","sourcePdf":"053054.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.030076S","chronDate":"Jan.  1985","isNumber":"6311914","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"101","citationCount":"5","articleId":"6311924","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1985","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6311946,"authors":[{"name":"Randall L.

The model takes into consideration drift velocity saturation, channel length modulation, and subthreshold current effects. In addition, the model depends primarily on physical (i.e. material and geometric) rather than empirical parameters. Combined with the SPICE program, a general CAD tool is formed which can be used to aid in the design of GaAs circuits such a power amplifiers, oscillators, mixers, and fast-switching digital integrated circuits.

Nevertheless, because of its subtle nature and the relatively low probability of its occurrence in conventional systems, this phenomenon is neither well understood nor widely appreciated. With continuing advances in digital technology, however, there is a growing interest in large-scale highly parallel systems. Such systems are likely to involve numerous high-frequency asynchronous interactions, which may result in frequent measures to prevent such failures. In recent years, a number of researchers have been working with some success to develop techniques for dealing with this failure mode. The purpose of this paper is to present a comprehensive theory of metastable operation that may lead to a better understanding of this phenomenon and provide theoretical support for further work in this area.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"General theory of metastable operation","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","doi":"10.1109/TC.1981.6312173","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/12/6312170/06312173.pdf","startPage":"107","endPage":"115","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.1981.6312173","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6312170","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6312173","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6312173/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb.  1981","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  1981","displayDocTitle":"General theory of metastable operation","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"C-30","issue":"2","dateOfInsertion":"25 September 2012","publicationDate":"Feb. 1981","accessionNumber":"1670872","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"General theory of metastable operation","sourcePdf":"107115.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.0276S","chronDate":"Feb.  1981","isNumber":"6312170","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"76","articleId":"6312173","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1981","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6312174,"authors":[{"name":"Marc Davio","affiliation":["Philips Research National Laboratory, Brussels, Belgium"],"firstName":"Marc","lastName":"Davio","id":"37320153500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9340"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9956"},{"format":"CD","value":"2326-3814"}],"articleNumber":"6312174","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":124,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":299},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org"}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Kronecker products and shuffle algebra","abstract":"Relates three classical concepts, viz. mixed radix number system, Kronecker product of matrices, and perfect shuffle.

A fat-tree routing network is parameterized not only in the number of processors, but also in the amount of simultaneous communication it can support. Since communication can be scaled independently from the number of processors, substantial hardware can be saved for such applications as finite-element analysis without resorting to a special-purpose architecture. It is proved that a fat-tree of a given size is nearly the best routing network of that size. This universality theorem is established using a three-dimensional VLSI model that incorporates wiring as a direct cost. In this model, hardware size is measured as physical volume. It is proved that for any given amount of communications hardware, a fat-tree built from that amount of hardware can stimulate every other network built from the same amount of hardware, using only slightly more time (a polylogarithmic factor greater).","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6312192/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  1985","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct.  1985","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"C-34","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 1985","dateOfInsertion":"25 September 2012","accessionNumber":"2582046","displayDocTitle":"Fat-trees: Universal networks for hardware-efficient supercomputing","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fat-trees: Universal networks for hardware-efficient supercomputing","sourcePdf":"892901.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.042858S","chronDate":"Oct.  1985","isNumber":"6312188","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"461","articleId":"6312192","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1985","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6312194,"authors":[{"name":"Jim Crammond","affiliation":["Department of Applied Mathematics, Weizmann Institute of Science, Israel","Department of Computer Science, Heriot-Watt University, Edinburgh, UK"],"firstName":"Jim","lastName":"Crammond","id":"38488456600"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9340"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9956"},{"format":"CD","value":"2326-3814"}],"articleNumber":"6312194","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":23},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Vectors","Indexes","Reactive power","Algorithm design and analysis","Memory management","Parallel processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer architecture","file organisation","logic programming","program interpreters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["unification algorithms","OR-parallel execution","logic languages","computer architecture","memory management techniques","multiple binding environments","Prolog-like interpreter","logic programs","performance analysis"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Logic programming","memory management","OR-parallelism","performance evaluation"]}],"abstract":"As a step toward designing a computer architecture suitable for executing parallel logic languages, the author has studied some memory management techniques proposed for creating multiple binding environments, which are required with OR-parallelism.

A quantitative investigation of the performance impact of such contention and the effectiveness of combining in reducing this impact is reported. The effect of a nonuniform traffic pattern consisting of a single hot spot of higher access rate superimposed on a background of uniform traffic was investigated. The potential degradation due to even moderate hot spot traffic was found to be very significant, severely degrading all memory access, not just access to shared lock locations, due to an effect the authors call tree saturation. The technique of message combining was found to be an effective means of eliminating this problem if it arises due to lock or synchronization contention.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"\u201cHot spot\u201d contention and combining in multistage interconnection networks","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","doi":"10.1109/TC.1985.6312198","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/12/6312188/06312198.pdf","startPage":"943","endPage":"948","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.1985.6312198","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6312188","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6312198","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6312198/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct.  1985","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  1985","displayDocTitle":"\u201cHot spot\u201d contention and combining in multistage interconnection networks","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"C-34","issue":"10","dateOfInsertion":"25 September 2012","publicationDate":"Oct. 1985","accessionNumber":"2582052","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"\u201cHot spot\u201d contention and combining in multistage interconnection networks","sourcePdf":"943948.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.02888S","chronDate":"Oct.  1985","isNumber":"6312188","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"253","articleId":"6312198","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1985","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6312199,"authors":[{"name":"Wilfried Oed","affiliation":["Zentralinstitut f\u00fcr Angewandte Mathematik, Kernforschungsanlage J\u00fclich GmbH, Julich, Germany"],"firstName":"Wilfried","lastName":"Oed","id":"38488542300"},{"name":"Otto Lange","affiliation":["Allgemeine Elektrotechnik und Datenverarbeitungssysteme, Rheinisch-Westf\u00e4lische Technische Hochschule Aachen University, Aachen, Germany"],"firstName":"Otto","lastName":"Lange","id":"38488414500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9340"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9956"},{"format":"CD","value":"2326-3814"}],"articleNumber":"6312199","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":38,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":103},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6312199","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the effective bandwidth of interleaved memories in vector processor systems","abstract":"Memory interleaving and multiple access ports are the key to a high memory bandwidth in vector processor systems.

The processing elements have been designed to reduce the number of VLSI component types required and for modularity of the physical system. The modular nature of the architecture allows a range of throughput and reliability requirements to be met. The model of execution, derived from original data-flow principles, is presented, as well as the various software tools which give the system its high-level language programmability.

It consists of a switched-capacitor integrator, comparator, and digital logic circuit. Driven by the two phase clock, the integrator accumulates consecutively the incremental signal charge while extracting the quantized reference charge from the accumulated signal charge each time its output becomes positive, to keep their charge balance. The ratio between the accumulated and extracted frequencies for a given period of time then provides the digital representation of an input analog signal. A conversion accuracy higher than 14 bits can be expected from its integrated realization because the offset voltage and the finite open-loop gain of an op-amp and the parasitic capacitance have no effect upon the conversion process. It also features a small device-count integrate onto a very small chip area. Some applications are also presented to demonstrate its validity.","doi":"10.1109/TIM.1987.6312573","startPage":"873","endPage":"878","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","pdfPath":"/iel5/19/6312566/06312573.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIM.1987.6312573","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6312566","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A switched-capacitor charge-balancing analog-to-digital converter and its application to capacitance measurement","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Capacitance","Clocks","Accuracy","Transducers","Switches","Capacitors","Capacitance measurement"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6312573/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1987","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1987","displayDocTitle":"A switched-capacitor charge-balancing analog-to-digital converter and its application to capacitance measurement","volume":"IM-36","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 1987","dateOfInsertion":"25 September 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A switched-capacitor charge-balancing analog-to-digital converter and its application to capacitance measurement","sourcePdf":"873878.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.048116S","chronDate":"Dec.  1987","isNumber":"6312566","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"19","citationCount":"56","articleId":"6312573","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1987","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":6312589,"authors":[{"name":"T.

This method depends for its reliability improvement on the assumption that programs that have been developed independently will fail independently. An experiment is described in which the fundamental axiom is tested. In all, 27 versions of a program were prepared independently from the same specification at two universities and then subjected to one million tests. The results of the tests revealed that the programs were individually extremely reliable but that the number of tests in which more than one program failed was substantially more than expected. The results of these tests are presented along with an analysis of some of the faults that were found in the programs.

Since the construction of a thesaurus is resource consuming an automatic generation method of a thesaurus-like structure is needed. A set-theoretical model of an abstract thesaurus is developed which is related to an automatic generation method based on cooccurrences of terms in the set of texts. Replacement of a basis set in the model and transformation of cooccurrence frequencies into fuzzy sets enables the transition from the abstract mathematical model to an actual procedure of automatic generation. The generated structure is called a pseudothesaurus. An algorithm to generate the pseudothesaurus from a large amount of data is developed. Moreover, two examples based on a dictionary of scientific usage and on an actual bibliographic database are given.","doi":"10.1109/TSMC.1983.6313030","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6313021","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSMC.1983.6313030","endPage":"70","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/21/6313021/06313030.pdf","startPage":"62","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Generation of a pseudothesaurus for information retrieval based on cooccurrences and fuzzy set operations","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.-Feb.  1983","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.-Feb.  1983","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6313030/","displayDocTitle":"Generation of a pseudothesaurus for information retrieval based on cooccurrences and fuzzy set operations","volume":"SMC-13","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"2031041","dateOfInsertion":"26 September 2012","publicationDate":"Jan.-Feb. 1983","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Generation of a pseudothesaurus for information retrieval based on cooccurrences and fuzzy set operations","sourcePdf":"062070.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.072397S","chronDate":"Jan.-Feb.  1983","isNumber":"6313021","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"21","citationCount":"10","articleId":"6313030","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1983","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6313036,"authors":[{"name":"Jong-Sen Lee","affiliation":["Digital Image Processing Laboratory, Naval Research Laboratory, Department of the Navy, Washington, DC 20375"],"firstName":"Jong-Sen","lastName":"Lee"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9472"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2168-2909"}],"articleNumber":"6313036","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":81,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":935},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Systems, Man, and Cybernetics Society","url":"http://www.ieeesmc.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6313036","abstract":"Speckles appearing in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images are generated by the coherent processing of radar signals. Basically the speckles have the nature of a multiplicative noise. A simple and effective method of smoothing speckle-corrupted images by a digital computer is discussed, based on the recently developed sigma filter. The sigma filter is motivated by the sigma probability of a Gaussian distribution. The pixel to be processed is replaced by an advantage of those neighboring pixels having their gray level within two noise standard deviations from that of the concerned pixel. Consequently the speckles are suppressed without blurring edges and fine detail. Several Seasat SAR images are used for illustration, and comparisons are made with several noise-smoothing algorithms. Extensions of this algorithm to contrast enhancement and signal-dependent noise filtering are also presented. This algorithm is computationally efficient, and has the potential to achieve real or near real-time processing.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Noise","Speckle","Filtering algorithms","Synthetic aperture radar","Smoothing methods","Standards","Algorithm design and analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computerised picture processing","radar theory","remote sensing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["speckle smoothing","synthetic aperture radar images","multiplicative noise","digital computer","sigma filter","Seasat SAR images","contrast enhancement","signal-dependent noise filtering","real-time processing"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6313021","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSMC.1983.6313036","startPage":"85","endPage":"89","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/21/6313021/06313036.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TSMC.1983.6313036","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A simple speckle smoothing algorithm for synthetic aperture radar images","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.-Feb.  1983","displayDocTitle":"A simple speckle smoothing algorithm for synthetic aperture radar images","accessionNumber":"2034353","publicationDate":"Jan.-Feb. 1983","volume":"SMC-13","issue":"1","dateOfInsertion":"26 September 2012","isJournal":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6313036/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.-Feb.  1983","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A simple speckle smoothing algorithm for synthetic aperture radar images","sourcePdf":"085089.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.027325S","chronDate":"Jan.-Feb.  1983","isNumber":"6313021","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"21","citationCount":"81","articleId":"6313036","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1983","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6313074,"authors":[{"name":"James A.

The task is to balance a pole that is hinged to a movable cart by applying forces to the cart's base. It is argued that the learning problems faced by adaptive elements that are components of adaptive networks are at least as difficult as this version of the pole-balancing problem. The learning system consists of a single associative search element (ASE) and a single adaptive critic element (ACE). In the course of learning to balance the pole, the ASE constructs associations between input and output by searching under the influence of reinforcement feedback, and the ACE constructs a more informative evaluation function than reinforcement feedback alone can provide. The differences between this approach and other attempts to solve problems using neurolike elements are discussed, as is the relation of this work to classical and instrumental conditioning in animal learning studies and its possible implications for research in the neurosciences.","doi":"10.1109/TSMC.1983.6313077","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6313056","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSMC.1983.6313077","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/21/6313056/06313077.pdf","startPage":"834","endPage":"846","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neuronlike adaptive elements that can solve difficult learning control problems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.-Oct.  1983","displayDocTitle":"Neuronlike adaptive elements that can solve difficult learning control problems","volume":"SMC-13","issue":"5","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.-Oct.  1983","dateOfInsertion":"26 September 2012","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept.-Oct. 1983","accessionNumber":"2235948","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6313077/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neuronlike adaptive elements that can solve difficult learning control problems","sourcePdf":"08340846.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.023505S","chronDate":"Sept.-Oct.  1983","isNumber":"6313056","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"21","citationCount":"752","articleId":"6313077","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1983","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-22"},{"_id":6313086,"authors":[{"name":"Daniel A.

Particular attention is given to the fact that receptive field profiles of simple cells in the visual cortex often resemble even-symmetric or odd-symmetric Gabor filters; i.e. their receptive field profiles can be described by the product of a Gaussian and either a cosine or sine function. Their spatial frequency tuning is of medium bandwidth (~one octave) which is narrow enough for a cell to distinguish the third harmonic from the fundamental frequency for square-wave gratings of low spatial frequency. The responses of adjacent simple cells, tuned to the same spatial frequency, orientation, and direction, differ in their phase response to drifting sine-wave gratings by approximately either 90\u00b0 or 180\u00b0. This latter result makes it possible to consider two adjacent simple cell pairs as operating like paired Gaussian-attenuated sine and cosine filters of Gabor filters for restricted regions of visual space. The entire set of simple cells provides a complete representation of the visual scene, yet each simple cell is unique in its response properties. At the complex cell stage, the cell's mean firing rate appears to represent the amplitude of a local Fourier coefficient, but phase information is seldom conveyed with much precision in the action potential code.","doi":"10.1109/TSMC.1983.6313086","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/21/6313056/06313086.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSMC.1983.6313086","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6313056","startPage":"907","endPage":"916","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Visual cortical neurons as localized spatial frequency filters","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6313086","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Visual cortical neurons as localized spatial frequency filters","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.-Oct.  1983","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6313086/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.-Oct.  1983","isJournal":true,"volume":"SMC-13","issue":"5","publicationDate":"Sept.-Oct. 1983","accessionNumber":"2217392","dateOfInsertion":"26 September 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Visual cortical neurons as localized spatial frequency filters","sourcePdf":"09070916.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.017526S","chronDate":"Sept.-Oct.  1983","isNumber":"6313056","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"21","citationCount":"77","articleId":"6313086","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1983","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6313112,"authors":[{"name":"Rodney A.

Specifically, the distance measure is defined as the cost of recognition of nodes plus the number of transformations which include node insertion, node deletion, branch insertion, branch deletion, node label substitution and branch label substitution. The major difference between the proposed distance measure and the other ones is the consideration of the cost of recognition of nodes in the distance computation. In order to do this, the principal features of the nodes are described by one or several cost functions which are used to compute the similarity between the input nodes and the reference ones.

Estimates of total system energy are used in regulating hopping height in order to initiate hopping, to maintain level hopping, to change from one hopping height to another, and to terminate hopping.

The role of such an abstraction hierarchy in supervisory systems control is reviewed, and the difference between causal and intentional systems and formal games is discussed in terms of the role of an abstraction hierarchy in the related decision strategies. This relationship is then discussed with reference to the classical psychological problem-solving research of O. Selz (1922) and others. Finally, the implications for the design of decision-support systems are discussed. It is argued that an explicit description of the functional properties of the system to be controlled in terms of an abstraction hierarchy is necessary for a consistent design of databases and display formats for decision-support systems. Also, it is necessary to consider the role of the abstraction hierarchy in reasoning when planning experiments on human decision-making.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March-April  1985","chronOrPublicationDate":"March-April  1985","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6313353/","volume":"SMC-15","issue":"2","accessionNumber":"2523801","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March-April 1985","dateOfInsertion":"26 September 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"The role of hierarchical knowledge representation in decisionmaking and system management","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The role of hierarchical knowledge representation in decisionmaking and system management","sourcePdf":"234243.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038341S","chronDate":"March-April  1985","isNumber":"6313348","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"21","citationCount":"65","articleId":"6313353","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1985","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6313354,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Reverse engineering is considered as the process of developing a set of specifications for a complex hardware system by an orderly examination of specimens of that system. It is assumed that the specifications are being developed for the purpose of making a clone of the original hardware system, a circumstance which requires the most comprehensive form of specifications. Document formats are described for recording information and data in the reverse engineering process that are synergistic with the method recommended for use in guiding that process. The documentation suggested directs the reverse engineering process that uncovers the information which is recorded in the documents. A reverse engineering method is described that is based on the premise that a complex hardware system can be characterized as a hierarchical structure. The key feature of this method is that when it is applied to a specific level in the hardware structural hierarchy, it is used to uncover the internal particulars of a specific item of that level in terms of the elements located in the immediately subordinate level and how those elements are interconnected.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6313348","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/21/6313348/06313354.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TSMC.1985.6313354","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSMC.1985.6313354","startPage":"244","endPage":"252","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On reverse engineering","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March-April  1985","chronOrPublicationDate":"March-April  1985","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6313354/","displayDocTitle":"On reverse engineering","isJournal":true,"volume":"SMC-15","issue":"2","accessionNumber":"2531943","dateOfInsertion":"26 September 2012","publicationDate":"March-April 1985","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On reverse engineering","sourcePdf":"244252.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.015694S","chronDate":"March-April  1985","isNumber":"6313348","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"21","citationCount":"20","articleId":"6313354","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1985","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6313361,"authors":[{"name":"Rama Chellappa","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering-Systems and the Image Processing Institute, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA 90089, USA"],"firstName":"Rama","lastName":"Chellappa"},{"name":"Shankar Chatterjee","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering-Systems and the Image Processing Institute, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA 90089, USA"],"firstName":"Shankar","lastName":"Chatterjee"},{"name":"Richard Bagdazian","affiliation":["Hughes Aircraft Company, El Segundo, CA, 90245 USA"],"firstName":"Richard","lastName":"Bagdazian"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9472"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2168-2909"}],"articleNumber":"6313361","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":50,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":218},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Systems, Man, and Cybernetics Society","url":"http://www.ieeesmc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Mathematical model","Computational modeling","Boundary conditions","Vectors","Plastics","Cybernetics","Complexity theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["encoding","Markov processes","parameter estimation","picture processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["parameter estimation","texture synthesis","texture compression","picture processing","Gaussian-Markov random field models","coding","neighboring observations","periodic boundary conditions"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TSMC.1985.6313361","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/21/6313348/06313361.pdf","startPage":"298","endPage":"303","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6313348","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSMC.1985.6313361","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6313361","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Texture synthesis and compression using Gaussian-Markov random field models","abstract":"The usefulness is illustrated of two-dimensional (2-D) Gaussian-Markov random field (MRF) models for coding of textures.

The stability of a fuzzy dynamic system is based on a generalization of this notion. If a free fuzzy dynamic system has an asymptotically stable equilibrium state, the stored energy of the system displaced within the domain of attraction decays with time until it assumes its minimum value at the equilibrium state. An energy `measure' of a fuzzy dynamic system is proposed, and `an energy function' is formulated. A heuristic algorithm for determining the stability of the fuzzy system is also proposed. To illustrate the applications of the algorithm, some numerical examples are given.","doi":"10.1109/TSMC.1985.6313463","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/21/6313451/06313463.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6313451","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSMC.1985.6313463","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","startPage":"783","endPage":"792","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energetistic stability of fuzzy dynamic systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6313463","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.-Dec.  1985","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.-Dec.  1985","displayDocTitle":"Energetistic stability of fuzzy dynamic systems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6313463/","volume":"SMC-15","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov.-Dec. 1985","accessionNumber":"2620786","dateOfInsertion":"26 September 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energetistic stability of fuzzy dynamic systems","sourcePdf":"783792.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034822S","chronDate":"Nov.-Dec.  1985","isNumber":"6313451","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"21","citationCount":"67","articleId":"6313463","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1985","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6313548,"authors":[{"name":"Ivana Chingovska","affiliation":["Idiap Research Institute, Martigny, Suisse, Germany"],"firstName":"Ivana","lastName":"Chingovska","id":"38488410500"},{"name":"Andr\u00e9 Anjos","affiliation":["Idiap Research Institute, Martigny, Suisse, Germany"],"firstName":"Andr\u00e9","lastName":"Anjos","id":"38241985600"},{"name":"S\u00e9bastien Marcel","affiliation":["Idiap Research Institute, Martigny, Suisse, Germany"],"firstName":"S\u00e9bastien","lastName":"Marcel","id":"37270970400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-3-88579-290-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1010-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1617-5468"}],"articleNumber":"6313548","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":43,"citationCountPatent":5,"totalDownloads":2072},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Databases","Videos","Histograms","Face","Vectors","Training","Support vector machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biometrics (access control)","digital photography","face recognition","image texture","screens (display)","video signal processing","visual databases"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["local binary pattern","face antispoofing","face spoofing attack detection","security trait","biometric recognition system","biometric evidence","biometric modality","face recognition","texture feature","printed photograph","video processing","electronic screen","REPLAY-ATTACK","face spooling database","LBP"]}],"abstract":"Spoofing attacks are one of the security traits that biometric recognition systems are proven to be vulnerable to. When spoofed, a biometric recognition system is bypassed by presenting a copy of the biometric evidence of a valid user. Among all biometric modalities, spoofing a face recognition system is particularly easy to perform: all that is needed is a simple photograph of the user. In this paper, we address the problem of detecting face spoofing attacks. In particular, we inspect the potential of texture features based on Local Binary Patterns (LBP) and their variations on three types of attacks: printed photographs, and photos and videos displayed on electronic screens of different sizes. For this purpose, we introduce REPLAY-ATTACK, a novel publicly available face spoofing database which contains all the mentioned types of attacks. We conclude that LBP, with ~15% Half Total Error Rate, show moderate discriminability when confronted with a wide set of attack types.","publicationTitle":"2012 BIOSIG - Proceedings of the International Conference of Biometrics Special Interest Group (BIOSIG)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 BIOSIG - Proceedings of the International Conference of Biometrics Special Interest Group (BIOSIG)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6305020/6313527/06313548.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6313527","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the effectiveness of local binary patterns in face anti-spoofing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6313548","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"On the effectiveness of local binary patterns in face anti-spoofing","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-7 Sept. 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6313548/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"6-7 Sept. 2012","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2012","accessionNumber":"13029854","dateOfInsertion":"27 September 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6313548/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the effectiveness of local binary patterns in face anti-spoofing","confLoc":"Darmstadt, Germany","sourcePdf":"115ontheeffectiveness.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059632S","chronDate":"6-7 Sept. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6305020","isNumber":"6313527","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6305020","citationCount":"43","xplore-issue":"6313527","articleId":"6313548","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Gesellschaft fr Informatik","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6313570,"authors":[{"name":"Hussein Seleem","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, and Prince Sultan Advanced Technologies Research Institute (PSATRI), King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia"],"firstName":"Hussein","lastName":"Seleem","id":"38516301300"},{"name":"Abdelouahab Bentrcia","affiliation":["Prince Sultan Advanced Technologies Research Institute (PSATRI), King Saud University, Saudi Arabia"],"firstName":"Abdelouahab","lastName":"Bentrcia","id":"37284711100"},{"name":"Habib Fathallah","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, Laval University, Quebec, Canada","Electrical Engineering Department, Prince Sultan Advanced Technologies Research Institute (PSATRI), and the KACST Technology Innovation Center (RFTONICS), King Saud University, Saudi Arabia"],"firstName":"Habib","lastName":"Fathallah","id":"37372974600"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"6313570","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":13,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":457},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Detectors","Interference cancellation","Passive optical networks","Integrated optics","Multiaccess communication","Bit error rate","Computational complexity"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","interference suppression","least mean squares methods","next generation networks","passive optical networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["projected parallel interference cancellation","asynchronous upstream OCDMA-PON","next generation passive optical networks","NG-PON","multiple access interference mitigation","MAI mitigation","incoherent DS-OCDMA","linear parallel interference cancellation detector","LPIC detector","linear minimum mean square error detector","LMMSE detector"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Multiuser detector (MUD)","parallel interference cancellation (PIC)","OCDMA-PON"]}],"abstract":"OCDMA is a promising candidate for next generation passive optical networks (NG-PON). OCDMA-PON can potentially provide all customers with a Gb/s-class BW upstream with inherent flexibility. Unfortunately OCDMA suffers from multiple access interference (MAI) and various detection noises. To mitigate MAI, we propose a novel parallel interference cancellation technique for incoherent DS-OCDMA that better exploits the non-negativity of the solution. The proposed PIC scheme incorporates this additional information into its structure. The proposed PIC detector is shown to outperform the conventional correlator detector, the decorrelator detector, the linear parallel interference Cancellation (LPIC) detector and even the linear minimum mean square error (LMMSE) detector.","doi":"10.1109/LCOMM.2012.091712.120962","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/4234/6361502/06313570.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCOMM.2012.091712.120962","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6361502","startPage":"1721","endPage":"1724","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Projected Parallel Interference Cancellation for Asynchronous Upstream OCDMA-PON","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6313570","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Projected Parallel Interference Cancellation for Asynchronous Upstream OCDMA-PON","chronOrPublicationDate":"November  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6313570/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 September 2012","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"16","issue":"11","publicationDate":"November 2012","accessionNumber":"13146805","dateOfInsertion":"26 November 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6313570/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Projected Parallel Interference Cancellation for Asynchronous Upstream OCDMA-PON","sourcePdf":"1721-cl1211-seleem.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034959S","chronDate":"November  2012","xplore-pub-id":"4234","isNumber":"6361502","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4234","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"6361502","articleId":"6313570","onlineDate":"26 September 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6313571,"authors":[{"name":"Tanee Demeechai","affiliation":["National Electronics and Computer Technology Center, Pathumthani, Thailand"],"firstName":"Tanee","lastName":"Demeechai","id":"37297157300"},{"name":"Tae-Gyu Chang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Chung-Ang University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Tae-Gyu","lastName":"Chang","id":"37279408800"},{"name":"Siwaruk Siwamogsatham","affiliation":["National Electronics and Computer Technology Center, Pathumthani, Thailand"],"firstName":"Siwaruk","lastName":"Siwamogsatham","id":"37300974800"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"6313571","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":578},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Timing","Estimation","Algorithm design and analysis","Cognitive radio","Interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","frequency-domain analysis","mean square error methods","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frequency-domain OFDM-timing estimator","frequency-domain algorithm","OFDM-timing estimation","OFDM system","narrowband interference channel","cognitive radio OFDM-based overlay system","complex timing metric","power-delay profile","noise condition","channel-induced bias","estimation error","root-mean-square error"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["OFDM","synchronization","timing estimation","narrowband interference"]}],"abstract":"A frequency-domain algorithm for OFDM-timing estimation is considered useful when the OFDM system is to operate in a known narrowband interference channel, e.g., in a cognitive radio OFDM-based overlay system. We generalize a recently proposed frequency-domain algorithm for OFDM-timing estimation and then analyze the performance of the algorithm. The algorithm is based on a complex timing metric that has the mean of which the angle depends in an affine manner on the time offset. By computing the mean of the metric and the mean square of the metric component orthogonal to the mean, from the power-delay profile and noise condition of the channel, the channel-induced bias of the estimator is quantified and the root-mean-square of the estimation error is estimated. The discrepancy between analysis and simulation results on the root-mean-square error is less than one nominal sampling interval for a useful range of operating conditions.","doi":"10.1109/LCOMM.2012.091712.121139","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/4234/6331035/06313571.pdf","startPage":"1680","endPage":"1683","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCOMM.2012.091712.121139","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6331035","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance of a Frequency-Domain OFDM-Timing Estimator","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6313571","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 September 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"October  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6313571/","displayDocTitle":"Performance of a Frequency-Domain OFDM-Timing Estimator","volume":"16","issue":"10","publicationDate":"October 2012","accessionNumber":"13057055","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6313571/","dateOfInsertion":"15 October 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance of a Frequency-Domain OFDM-Timing Estimator","sourcePdf":"1680-cl1210-demeechai.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.053338S","chronDate":"October  2012","xplore-pub-id":"4234","isNumber":"6331035","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4234","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6331035","articleId":"6313571","onlineDate":"26 September 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-04"},{"_id":6313572,"authors":[{"name":"Seunghun Jang","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Yonsei University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Seunghun","lastName":"Jang","id":"37069404900"},{"name":"Young-Min Cho","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Yonsei University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Young-Min","lastName":"Cho","id":"37403266100"},{"name":"Janghoon Yang","affiliation":["Department of Newmedia, Korean German Institute of Technology, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Janghoon","lastName":"Yang","id":"37406103400"},{"name":"Dong Ku Kim","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Yonsei University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Dong Ku","lastName":"Kim","id":"37279322500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"6313572","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":368},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Transceivers","MIMO","Vectors","Power demand","Signal to noise ratio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mean square error methods","MIMO systems","multi-access systems","radio transceivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["uplink downlink mean square error duality","MSE duality","sum-MSE","per user MSE","per stream MSE","multiuser MIMO relay system","multiuser multiple-input multiple-output system","power constraint","transceiver","scale factor"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MIMO","relay","mean square error"]}],"abstract":"This paper shows how uplink (UL)-downlink (DL) mean square error (MSE) duality holds in a single relay aided multi-user multiple-input multiple-output (MU-MIMO) system.

network where the relay node harvests energy from radio frequency (RF) radiation. The source node is the only available RF generator and introduces a fundamental switching between energy harvesting and data relaying. A greedy switching (GS) policy where the relay node transmits when its residual energy ensures decoding at the destination is investigated. The GS policy is modeled as a Markov chain for a discretized battery; the stationary distribution and the outage probability of the system are derived in closed form expressions. In addition, an optimal switching policy that incorporates a-priori knowledge of the channel coefficients is proposed and solved by a mixed-integer linear programming formulation.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6313575/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 September 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"November  2012","volume":"16","issue":"11","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"13146807","dateOfInsertion":"26 November 2012","publicationDate":"November 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6313575/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"RF Energy Transfer for Cooperative Networks: Data Relaying or Energy Harvesting?","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"RF Energy Transfer for Cooperative Networks: Data Relaying or Energy Harvesting?","sourcePdf":"1772-cl1211-krikidis.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.096317S","chronDate":"November  2012","xplore-pub-id":"4234","isNumber":"6361502","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4234","citationCount":"228","xplore-issue":"6361502","articleId":"6313575","onlineDate":"26 September 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-22"},{"_id":6313577,"authors":[{"name":"Nariman Rahimian","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Texas A&M University, College Station, TX"],"firstName":"Nariman","lastName":"Rahimian","id":"37589948300"},{"name":"Hasari Celebi","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, Gebze Institute of Technology, Gebze, Turkey"],"firstName":"Hasari","lastName":"Celebi","id":"37410115200"},{"name":"Costas N.

However, these methods cannot be used for the single sample per person scenario because the within-subject variability cannot be estimated in this case. In the generic learning solution, this variability is estimated using images of a generic training set, for which more than one sample per person is available. However, because of rather poor estimation of the within-subject variability using a generic set, the performance of discriminant analysis methods is yet to be satisfactory. This problem particularly exists when images are under drastic facial expression variation. In this paper, we show that images with the same expression are located on a common subspace, which here we call it the expression subspace. We show that by projecting an image with an arbitrary expression into the expression subspaces, we can synthesize new expression images. By means of the synthesized images for subjects with one image sample, we can obtain more accurate estimation of the within-subject variability and achieve significant improvement in recognition. We performed comprehensive experiments on two large face databases: the Face Recognition Grand Challenge and the Cohn-Kanade AU-Coded Facial Expression database to support the proposed methodology.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6313589/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.-March  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 September 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6313589/","dateOfInsertion":"11 April 2013","publicationDate":"Jan.-March 2013","accessionNumber":"13429033","volume":"4","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Projection into Expression Subspaces for Face Recognition from Single Sample per Person","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Projection into Expression Subspaces for Face Recognition from Single Sample per Person","sourcePdf":"tta2013010069.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.065187S","chronDate":"Jan.-March  2013","xplore-pub-id":"5165369","isNumber":"6496213","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5165369","citationCount":"46","xplore-issue":"6496213","articleId":"6313589","onlineDate":"26 September 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6313590,"authors":[{"name":"John P.

We will see that it does seem plausible that some people might buy a love machine if it were created, but it is argued here that principles from machine ethics have a role to play in the design of these machines. This is best achieved by applying what is known about the philosophy of love, the ethics of loving relationships, and the philosophical value of the erotic in the early design stage of building robust artificial companions. The paper concludes by proposing certain ethical limits on the manipulation of human psychology when it comes to building sex robots and in the simulation of love in such machines. In addition, the paper argues that the attainment of erotic wisdom is an ethically sound goal and that it provides more to loving relationships than only satisfying physical desire. This fact may limit the possibility of creating a machine that can fulfill all that one should want out of erotic love unless a machine can be built that would help its user attain this kind of love.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 September 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"Fourth Quarter  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6313590/","volume":"3","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/6313590/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"13218970","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Fourth Quarter 2012","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Robots, Love, and Sex: The Ethics of Building a Love Machine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robots, Love, and Sex: The Ethics of Building a Love Machine","sourcePdf":"tta2012040398.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.070475S","chronDate":"Fourth Quarter  2012","xplore-pub-id":"5165369","isNumber":"6407459","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5165369","citationCount":"83","xplore-issue":"6407459","articleId":"6313590","onlineDate":"26 September 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-09"},{"_id":6313592,"authors":[{"name":"Kazim Yumbul","affiliation":["Gebze Institute of Technology, Kocaeli, Gebze, Turkey"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/12/6810193/6313592/6313592-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Kazim Yumbul received the BS and MS degrees in electrical engineering from the Electrical and Electronics Engineering Department, Ege University, \u0130zmir, Turkey, in 1998 and 2001, respectively.

As we treat each contribution as independent, the objective function is convex in the parameters and a global solution is guaranteed. We start by recovering 3D shape using a novel algorithm which incorporates generalization error of the model obtained from empirical measurements. We then describe two methods to recover facial texture, diffuse lighting, specular reflectance, and camera properties from a single image. The methods make increasingly weak assumptions and can be solved in a linear fashion. We evaluate our findings on a publicly available database, where we are able to outperform an existing state-of-the-art algorithm.

In the first stage of MGBSO, the coarse area of the global optimum is estimated using the proposed search algorithm. Then in the second stage, rescaling concept is also taken into account along with the proposed search algorithm. In this process, after an approximate convergence of the swarm in a certain scale, scale changes and a new swarm is reinitialized around the best member found so far in a finer scale, i.e. smaller search space. Rescaling continues until a termination criterion is satisfied. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm has the best performance for the rotated versions of the well-known multimodal benchmarks in comparison to several PSO variants, which makes it a suitable choice for real world complex optimization problems. Furthermore, there is no considerable degradation in the results in face of the rotated benchmarks comparing to the respective nonrotated ones, where PSO variants suffer from rotation.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Benchmark testing","Particle swarm optimization","Convergence","Optimization","Silicon","Approximation algorithms","Degradation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convergence","evolutionary computation","gradient methods","search problems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiscale gradient based swarm optimizer","adaptive gradient based search algorithm","rescaling concept","MGBSO","global optimum","approximate swarm convergence","search space","termination criterion","multimodal benchmarks","complex optimization problem"]}],"doi":"10.1109/AISP.2012.6313716","publicationTitle":"The 16th CSI International Symposium on Artificial Intelligence and Signal Processing (AISP 2012)","displayPublicationTitle":"The 16th CSI International Symposium on Artificial Intelligence and Signal Processing (AISP 2012)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6305329/6313706/06313716.pdf","startPage":"049","endPage":"053","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6313706","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AISP.2012.6313716","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiscale Gradient Based Swarm Optimizer","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6313716","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Multiscale Gradient Based Swarm Optimizer","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6313716/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6313716/","accessionNumber":"13035329","conferenceDate":"2-3 May 2012","dateOfInsertion":"27 September 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-3 May 2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiscale Gradient Based Swarm Optimizer","confLoc":"Shiraz, Iran","sourcePdf":"010.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061612S","chronDate":"2-3 May 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6305329","isNumber":"6313706","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6305329","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6313706","articleId":"6313716","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6313744,"authors":[{"name":"Yasaman Karami","affiliation":["Computer Engineering Department, Iran University of Science and Technology, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Yasaman","lastName":"Karami","id":"38488492700"},{"name":"Mahmood fathy","affiliation":["Computer Engineering Department, Malek Ashtar University, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Mahmood","lastName":"fathy","id":"37266676300"},{"name":"Hamed Khakzad","affiliation":["Biophysics Department, Tarbiat Moalem University, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Hamed","lastName":"Khakzad","id":"38488712800"},{"name":"Hossein Shirazi","affiliation":["Computer Engineering Department, Iran University of Science and Technology, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Hossein","lastName":"Shirazi","id":"37546713200"},{"name":"Shahriar Arab","affiliation":["Computer Engineering Department, Malek Ashtar University, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Shahriar","lastName":"Arab","id":"37842288600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1479-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1478-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-1477-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6313744","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":275},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Proteins","Prediction algorithms","Amino acids","Mathematical model","Computational modeling","Genetic algorithms","Lattices"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ant colony optimisation","bioinformatics","computational complexity","evolutionary computation","particle swarm optimisation","proteins"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bio-inspired algorithm","bioinformatics","protein tertiary structure prediction","NP-hard problem","evolutionary algorithms","ant colony optimization","particle swarm optimization","computational methods","amino acid sequence","PSP problem"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["protein tertiary structure prediction","bio-computing","bio-inspired algorithm","evolutionary algorithm"]}],"abstract":"One of the main problems in Bioinformatics is the prediction of protein tertiary structure from its amino acid sequence.

GMM mean vectors are used to model the space span by the power spectra of the input noisy speech frames. No assumption is made on the nature or stationarity of the noise. No Voice Activity Detection (VAD) or any other means is used to estimate the input Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR). The mean vectors derived from mixture models of Power Spectral Densities (PSDs) of speech and different noise sources are used to form sets of over-determined system of equations, as many as noise source candidates, whose solutions lead to the MMSE estimations of speech and noise power spectra. These are then used for noise suppression by applying Wiener filtering carried out on overlapping frames. The input SNR is estimated and the nature of the noise involved is determined as by-products of the method used. Results are compared with those of two variants of a method based on approximate but explicit MMSE Bayesian estimation that show good results but suffer from long processing times. It is shown that, at the cost of a slight lower improvement in SNR and PESQ score, the new algorithm reduces the computation time to 1/30 which makes it suitable for practical applications.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6313756/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-3 May 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"2-3 May 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2012","dateOfInsertion":"27 September 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6313756/","accessionNumber":"13035369","displayDocTitle":"MMSE speech enhancement using GMM","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MMSE speech enhancement using GMM","confLoc":"Shiraz, Iran","sourcePdf":"050.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06925S","chronDate":"2-3 May 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6305329","isNumber":"6313706","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6305329","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6313706","articleId":"6313756","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6313763,"authors":[{"name":"Fahimeh Ansari-Ram","affiliation":["Digital System Design Lab, Electrical Engineering Department, Ferdowsi University of Mashhad, Iran"],"firstName":"Fahimeh","lastName":"Ansari-Ram","id":"38488526700"},{"name":"Saied Hosseini-Khayat","affiliation":["Digital System Design Lab, Electrical Engineering Department, Ferdowsi University of Mashhad, Iran"],"firstName":"Saied","lastName":"Hosseini-Khayat","id":"38270673000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1479-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1478-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-1477-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6313763","dbTime":"23 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":14,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":510},"abstract":"Wearable ECG sensors can assist in prolonged monitoring of cardiac patients.

The proposed algorithm procedure is based on the well-known ART networks. In recent years, ART networks have been widely used as an online data clustering technique in many applications. The problem with the ART networks is that when the network size increases due to the formation of new clusters, the clustering performance slows down. The situation will get worse if the incoming stream of data includes many outliers which will be processed by the network as new clusters. The proposed algorithm provides an online outlier handler which will solve the mentioned problem while categorizing the multi-dimensional input data using distribution-based clustering model. The outlier handling technique in the proposed algorithm could be used in other forms of ART networks such as ART1, ART2 and Fuzzy ART.","doi":"10.1109/AISP.2012.6313767","pdfPath":"/iel5/6305329/6313706/06313767.pdf","startPage":"327","endPage":"332","displayPublicationTitle":"The 16th CSI International Symposium on Artificial Intelligence and Signal Processing (AISP 2012)","publicationTitle":"The 16th CSI International Symposium on Artificial Intelligence and Signal Processing (AISP 2012)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AISP.2012.6313767","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6313706","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A dynamic size artificial neural network for online data clustering with a new outlier handling technique","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6313767/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-3 May 2012","displayDocTitle":"A dynamic size artificial neural network for online data clustering with a new outlier handling technique","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"27 September 2012","accessionNumber":"13035380","publicationDate":"May 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6313767/","conferenceDate":"2-3 May 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A dynamic size artificial neural network for online data clustering with a new outlier handling technique","confLoc":"Shiraz, Iran","sourcePdf":"061.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059047S","chronDate":"2-3 May 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6305329","isNumber":"6313706","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6305329","xplore-issue":"6313706","articleId":"6313767","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6313772,"authors":[{"name":"Hadi Lafzi Ghazi","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Tarbiat Moalem University, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Hadi","lastName":"Lafzi Ghazi","id":"38488412100"},{"name":"Mohammad Saniee Abadeh","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Tarbiat Moalem University, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Mohammad","lastName":"Saniee Abadeh","id":"37297398800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1479-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1478-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-1477-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6313772","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":222},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6313772","abstract":"An evolutionary approach for finding fuzzy association rule with 2-tuple linguistic representation model is presented in this work.

In fact our algorithm extracts both association rules and membership function in one step. Also we use Iterative Rule Learning (IRL) process to try to cover those instances that were still uncovered. To evaluate the proposed algorithm we use the stock price dataset and compare our results with the fuzzy mining approach which uses uniform fuzzy partitioning to extract fuzzy association rule.

Finding optimal value in image thresholding is a challenge for many researchers. In this paper, a novel method for image thresholding using Otsu and based on Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is proposed. The main idea of the proposed method is combination between Otsu ability in minimizing within-class variance and transferring more visual conception information. In order to make balance between these goals, this algorithm has two parts. In pre-processing phase, we try to obtain a Canonical image that consists of sensitive parts of image in order to transfer more visual information. After that, PSO tries to search around Otsu threshold to find optimal threshold with respect to Canonical image.

Due to the complex properties of acoustic signals, effective features for fault detection cannot be easily extracted from the raw acoustic signals. To extract representative features, signal processing techniques play an important role. One of the commonest techniques is Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). This method depends on the variations in frequency domain to distinguish different operating conditions of a machine. In this study, the intension is to categorize the acoustic signals into healthy and faulty classes. Acoustic emission signals are generated from four different automobile engines in both healthy and faulty conditions. The investigated fault is within the ignition system of the engines while they might suffer from other possible problems as well that may affect the generated acoustic signals. The energy of FFT coefficients of acoustic signals for different frequency bands are calculated as features. Correlation-based Feature Selection (CFS) algorithm is used to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset. The case study is carried-out on 4 different types of automobiles using 480 automobiles to prove the independency of the proposed approach on the type of the automobile. Classification results are reported to be around 88 percent accuracy.","displayPublicationTitle":"The 16th CSI International Symposium on Artificial Intelligence and Signal Processing (AISP

voltage level and smaller area. The unintended and undesirable result of this scaling is that it makes integrated circuits susceptible to soft errors normally caused by alpha particle or neutron hits. These events of radiation strike resulting into bit upsets referred to as single event upsets(SEU), become increasingly of concern for the reliable circuit operation in the field. Storage elements are worst hit by this phenomenon. As we further scale down, there is greater interest in reliability of the circuits and systems, apart from the performance, power and area aspects. In this paper we propose an improved 12T SEU tolerant SRAM cell design. The proposed SRAM cell is economical in terms of area overhead. It is easy to fabricate as compared to earlier designs. Simulation results show that the proposed cell is highly robust, as it does not flip even for a transient pulse with 62 times the Q\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">crit</sub>\n of a standard 6T SRAM cell.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6313834/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 June 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"June 2012","accessionNumber":"13029784","htmlLink":"/document/6313834/","dateOfInsertion":"27 September 2012","conferenceDate":"27-29 June 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"SEU tolerant robust memory cell design","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SEU tolerant robust memory cell design","confLoc":"Sitges, Spain","sourcePdf":"RP04P16.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.082821S","chronDate":"27-29 June 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6304844","isNumber":"6313830","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6304844","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"6313830","articleId":"6313834","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6313836,"authors":[{"name":"Cinzia Bernardeschi","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, University of Pisa, Italy"],"firstName":"Cinzia","lastName":"Bernardeschi","id":"37611013700"},{"name":"Luca Cassano","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, University of Pisa, Italy"],"firstName":"Luca","lastName":"Cassano","id":"37887699400"},{"name":"Andrea Domenici","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, University of Pisa, Italy"],"firstName":"Andrea","lastName":"Domenici","id":"37887699800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2085-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2082-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-2084-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1942-9398"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1942-9401"}],"articleNumber":"6313836","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":133},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Circuit faults","Table lookup","Integrated circuit modeling","Field programmable gate arrays","Testing","Safety","Multiplexing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automatic test pattern generation","field programmable gate arrays","integrated circuit reliability","integrated circuit testing","logic testing","radiation hardening (electronics)","SRAM chips"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["SEU unexcitability prover","SEU-X","single event upset fault","logic resources","SRAM-FPGA systems","configuration memory","in-service testing","test pattern generation","stuck-at fault model","SAL specification language","netlist modelling","SAL model checker","ITC benchmarks","ISCAS benchmarks","fault model"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Model-Checking","SAL","Single Event Upset","SRAM-FPGA","Untestability Proof"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6313836","abstract":"We propose an un-excitability prover for Single Event Upset (SEU) faults affecting the configuration memory of logic resources of SRAM-FPGA systems.

These embedded DRAMs can be used to efficiently implement caches since DRAMs require substantially less area than SRAMs. One challenge for DRAM based caches is that a small time between refreshes is needed to ensure data retention. These refreshes increase the power consumption even when the cache is idle. To mitigate this issue, the use of longer times between refreshes combined with the use of Error Correction Codes (ECCs) has been recently proposed. The idea is that the time between refreshes can be increased significantly while only causing data retention failures on a small percentage of the cells. Then those errors can be corrected by the ECC. For this scheme to be efficient the number of additional bits required by the ECC should be small. This is achieved by using large data blocks for the ECC which in turns means that a large data block has to be accessed even when only a small portion of it is needed. This has no effect on idle power consumption but increases the dynamic power consumption and reduces the effective memory bandwidth. In this paper, a technique to mitigate this issue is proposed. It enables better granularity in the read data accesses by partitioning the ECC block into two sub-blocks and modifying the error detection and correction processes. This reduces the dynamic power consumption and increases the available memory bandwidth while requiring only a moderate increase in the number of additional bits.","doi":"10.1109/IOLTS.2012.6313845","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 18th International On-Line Testing Symposium (IOLTS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 18th International On-Line Testing Symposium (IOLTS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6304844/6313830/06313845.pdf","startPage":"79","endPage":"83","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IOLTS.2012.6313845","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6313830","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low Power embedded DRAM caches using BCH code partitioning","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Low Power embedded DRAM caches using BCH code partitioning","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"27 September 2012","accessionNumber":"13029795","publicationDate":"June 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6313845/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6313845/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 June 2012","conferenceDate":"27-29 June 2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low Power embedded DRAM caches using BCH code partitioning","confLoc":"Sitges, Spain","sourcePdf":"RP15P01.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.0498S","chronDate":"27-29 June 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6304844","isNumber":"6313830","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6304844","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6313830","articleId":"6313845","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":6313847,"authors":[{"name":"Michael Nicolaidis","affiliation":["TIMA Laboratory, INP-Grenoble, UJF,  CNRS, France"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Nicolaidis","id":"37332469200"},{"name":"Vladimir Pasca","affiliation":["TIMA Laboratory, INP-Grenoble, UJF,  CNRS, France"],"firstName":"Vladimir","lastName":"Pasca","id":"37391652200"},{"name":"Lorena Anghel","affiliation":["TIMA Laboratory, INP-Grenoble, UJF,  CNRS, France"],"firstName":"Lorena","lastName":"Anghel","id":"37274135900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2085-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2082-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-2084-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1942-9398"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1942-9401"}],"articleNumber":"6313847","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":380},"abstract":"Three-dimensional (3D) integration by die-/wafer-level stacking becomes a reality, as Through-Silicon-Via technologies emerge. However, poor reliability and yield of TSV interconnects remain major challenges of this promising technology. In this paper, we propose an efficient Built-In Self-Repair (TSV-BISR) strategy for TSV faults due to manufacturing and aging defects. After interconnect tests, we replace faulty TSVs with fault-free spares using shift operations. Among the benefits of this solution is that the self-repair signals are determined on-chip without any external intervention. Moreover, we show that with TSV-BISR better reparability is achieved with fewer spares than in existing TSV repair techniques. We also show that for 3D chips with interconnect reparability targets above 98% we reduce the area needed for spares and repair logic by up to 40%.","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 18th

The relationship between the value of modulus and the fault missing rate is analyzed theoretically in this paper for fault-tolerant FIR filter design, and the results are verified by FPGA implemented fault injections.","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 18th International On-Line Testing Symposium (IOLTS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 18th International On-Line Testing Symposium (IOLTS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6304844/6313830/06313856.pdf","startPage":"130","endPage":"133","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fault missing rate analysis of the arithmetic residue codes based fault-tolerant FIR filter design","doi":"10.1109/IOLTS.2012.6313856","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6313830","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IOLTS.2012.6313856","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6313856","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6313856/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 June 2012","displayDocTitle":"Fault missing rate analysis of the arithmetic residue codes based fault-tolerant FIR filter design","dateOfInsertion":"27 September 2012","publicationDate":"June 2012","accessionNumber":"13029806","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"27-29 June 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6313856/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fault missing rate analysis of the arithmetic residue codes based fault-tolerant FIR filter design","confLoc":"Sitges, Spain","sourcePdf":"RP26P35.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074826S","chronDate":"27-29 June 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6304844","isNumber":"6313830","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6304844","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"6313830","articleId":"6313856","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6313859,"authors":[{"name":"Shusuke Yoshimoto","affiliation":["Kobe University, Japan"],"firstName":"Shusuke","lastName":"Yoshimoto","id":"37605295600"},{"name":"Takuro Amashita","affiliation":["Kobe University, Japan"],"firstName":"Takuro","lastName":"Amashita","id":"37946119400"},{"name":"Masayoshi Yoshimura","affiliation":["Kyushu University, Japan"],"firstName":"Masayoshi","lastName":"Yoshimura","id":"37592557100"},{"name":"Yusuke Matsunaga","affiliation":["Kyushu University, Japan"],"firstName":"Yusuke","lastName":"Matsunaga","id":"37278293500"},{"name":"Hiroto Yasuura","affiliation":["Kyushu University, Japan","JST-CREST, Japan"],"firstName":"Hiroto","lastName":"Yasuura","id":"37299568300"},{"name":"Shintaro Izumi","affiliation":["Kobe University, Japan"],"firstName":"Shintaro","lastName":"Izumi","id":"37408458100"},{"name":"Hiroshi Kawaguchi","affiliation":["Kobe University, Japan"],"firstName":"Hiroshi","lastName":"Kawaguchi","id":"37270375100"},{"name":"Masahiko Yoshimoto","affiliation":["Kobe University, Japan","JST-CREST, Japan"],"firstName":"Masahiko","lastName":"Yoshimoto","id":"37269600500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2085-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2082-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-2084-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1942-9398"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1942-9401"}],"articleNumber":"6313859","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":259},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Random access memory","MOS devices","Layout","Neutrons","Atmospheric modeling","Error analysis","Single event upset"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["integrated circuit layout","MOS integrated circuits","neutron effects","SRAM chips"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neutron-induced soft error rate estimation","SRAM","PHITS","SER estimation tool","data patterns","memory cell layout","NMOS-PMOS-NMOS 6T version","inside-out PMOS-NMOS-PMOS versions","single-event-upset","SEU","horizontal multiple-cell-upset","MCU","vertical MCU SER","extracting function","PMOS-NMOS-PMOS 6T SRAM cell layout","particle transport code"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["SRAM","neutron-induced soft error rate","multiple bit upset"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents a novel neutron-induced soft-error-rate (SER) estimation tool with a particle transport code: PHITS.

Detection of such degradation is important, particularly in wireless basestations which must operate round-the-clock with high dependability. In this paper, a new approach for detecting degradation in RF transmitter systems using pilot symbols is proposed and is superior to prior algorithms because degradation can be monitored on a frame-to-frame basis independent of the data being transmitted. The response of the RF transmitter to known pilot symbols is captured at the output of the RF power amplifier using an envelope detector and is fitted to a third order transmitter model using a model-parameter solving algorithm. It is shown that the computed model parameters deviate away from their nominal values, exhibiting model anomalies once nonidealities due to electrical degradation start affecting transmitter behavior. The amount of the degradation is proportional to the magnitude of this deviation as measured by a distance metric and is easily computed using simple algorithms running on the baseband processor. Preliminary results indicate the feasibility and low cost of the proposed approach.","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 18th International On-Line Testing Symposium (IOLTS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6304844/6313830/06313860.pdf","startPage":"142","endPage":"145","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 18th International On-Line Testing Symposium (IOLTS)","doi":"10.1109/IOLTS.2012.6313860","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IOLTS.2012.6313860","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6313830","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6313860","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Pilot symbol driven monitoring of electrical degradation in RF transmitter systems using model anomaly diagnosis","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radio frequency","Degradation","Transmitters","OFDM","Power amplifiers","Computational modeling","Mathematical model"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power amplifiers","radio transmitters","radiofrequency amplifiers","signal detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["pilot symbol driven monitoring","electrical degradation","RF transmitter system","model anomaly diagnosis","RF circuits","electrical stress","thermal effect","technology scaling","degradation detection","wireless base station","RF power amplifier","envelope detector","model parameter solving algorithm","distance metric","baseband processor"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Real-time estimation","RF distortion monitoring","OFDM transmitter"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6313860/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 June 2012","displayDocTitle":"Pilot symbol driven monitoring of electrical degradation in RF transmitter systems using model anomaly diagnosis","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6313860/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2012","accessionNumber":"13029810","dateOfInsertion":"27 September 2012","conferenceDate":"27-29 June 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Pilot symbol driven monitoring of electrical degradation in RF transmitter systems using model anomaly diagnosis","confLoc":"Sitges, Spain","sourcePdf":"RP30P10.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06983S","chronDate":"27-29 June 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6304844","isNumber":"6313830","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6304844","xplore-issue":"6313830","articleId":"6313860","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6313861,"authors":[{"name":"Zhen Wang","affiliation":["Reliable Computing Laboratory, Boston University, Boston, USA"],"firstName":"Zhen","lastName":"Wang","id":"37537359500"},{"name":"Mark Karpovsky","affiliation":["Reliable Computing Laboratory, Boston University, Boston, USA"],"firstName":"Mark","lastName":"Karpovsky","id":"37275727100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2085-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2082-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-2084-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1942-9398"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1942-9401"}],"articleNumber":"6313861","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":13,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":83},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6313861","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Error correction codes","Robustness","Clocks","Error correction","Vectors","Security"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["algebraic geometric codes","error correction codes","error detection codes","integrated circuit reliability","memory architecture","symbol manipulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["modern digital system design","byte errors","unanticipated errors correction","secure memory architecture","reliable memory architecture","robust algebraic manipulation correction codes","guaranteed error detection probability","consecutive clock cycles","error correction procedure","error probability","code-based memory architecture"]}],"doi":"10.1109/IOLTS.2012.6313861","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 18th International On-Line Testing Symposium (IOLTS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 18th International On-Line Testing Symposium (IOLTS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6304844/6313830/06313861.pdf","startPage":"146","endPage":"149","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IOLTS.2012.6313861","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6313830","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reliable and secure memories based on algebraic manipulation correction codes","abstract":"The reliability and security of memories are crucial considerations in the modern digital system design.

Conventional techniques, such as Triple-Modular Redundancy (TMR), can guarantee full fault coverage, but they also introduce very large overheads. Alternatively, approximate logic circuits can provide the necessary flexibility to find an optimal balance between error coverage and overheads. In this work, we propose a new approach to build approximate logic circuits driven by testability estimations. Using the concept of unate functions, approximations are performed in lines with low testability in order to minimize the impact on error coverage. The proposed approach is scalable and can provide a variety of solutions for different trade-offs between error coverage and overheads.","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 18th International On-Line Testing Symposium (IOLTS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6304844/6313830/06313868.pdf","startPage":"176","endPage":"181","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 18th International On-Line Testing Symposium (IOLTS)","doi":"10.1109/IOLTS.2012.6313868","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IOLTS.2012.6313868","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6313830","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6313868","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Logic masking for SET Mitigation Using Approximate Logic Circuits","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Approximation methods","Circuit faults","Logic circuits","Logic gates","Vectors","Transient analysis","Logic functions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["logic circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["logic masking","SET mitigation","approximate logic circuit","single event transient","testability estimation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Single-Event Transient","Soft error","Error detection and correction","Approximate circuit","testability"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6313868/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 June 2012","displayDocTitle":"Logic masking for SET Mitigation Using Approximate Logic Circuits","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6313868/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2012","accessionNumber":"13029818","dateOfInsertion":"27 September 2012","conferenceDate":"27-29 June 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Logic masking for SET Mitigation Using Approximate Logic Circuits","confLoc":"Sitges, Spain","sourcePdf":"RP38P19.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075929S","chronDate":"27-29 June 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6304844","isNumber":"6313830","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6304844","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"6313830","articleId":"6313868","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6313871,"authors":[{"name":"Xuegui Song","affiliation":["School of Engineering, University of British Columbia, Kelowna, BC, Canada"],"bio":{"p":["Xuegui Song (S'08) received the B.Eng. degree in electrical and information engineering from the Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an, China in 2003, and the M.A.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from the University of British Columbia, Kelowna, BC, Canada, in 2009, where he is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree in the School of Engineering.","His current research interests include digital communications over fading channels, orthogonal frequency division multiplexing, and optical wireless communications."]},"firstName":"Xuegui","lastName":"Song","id":"37308677000"},{"name":"Julian Cheng","affiliation":["School of Engineering, University of British Columbia, Kelowna, BC, Canada"],"bio":{"p":["Julian Cheng (S'96\u2013M'04) received the B.Eng. degree (First Class) in electrical engineering from the University of Victoria, Victoria, BC, Canada in 1995, the M.Sc.Eng. degree in mathematics and engineering from Queen's University, Kingston, ON, Canada, in 1997, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from the University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada, in 2003.","He is currently an Associate Professor in the School of Engineering, The University of British Columbia, Kelowna, BC. from 2005 to 2006, he was an Assistant Professor with the Department of Electrical Engineering, Lakehead University, Thunder Bay, ON.

In the interactions of microwaves with bare soil, the effects are determined by scattering of electromagnetic waves by random rough surfaces. In the interactions of microwaves with terrestrial snow, the effects are determined by volume scattering of dense media characterized by densely packed particles. In this paper, we review the electromagnetic full-wave simulations that we have conducted for such problems. In volume scattering problems, one needs many densely packed scatterers in a random medium sample to simulate the physical solutions. In random rough surface scattering problems, one needs many valleys and peaks in the sample surface. In random media and rough surface problems, the geometric characterizations of the media and computer generations of statistical samples of the media are also challenges besides electromagnetic computations. In the scattering of waves by soil surfaces, we consider the soil to be a lossy dielectric medium. The random rough surface is characterized by Gaussian random processes with exponential correlation functions. Surfaces of exponential correlation functions have fine-scale structures that cause significant radar backscattering in active microwave remote sensing. Fine-scale features also cause increase in emission in passive microwave remote sensing. We apply Monte Carlo simulations of solving full 3-D Maxwell's equations for such a problem. A hybrid UV/PBTG/SMCG method is developed to accelerate method of moment solutions. The results are illustrated for coherent waves and incoherent waves. We also illustrate bistatic scattering, backscattering, and emissivity which are signatures measured in microwave remote sensing. For the case of scattering by terrestrial snow, snow is a dense medium with densely packed ice grains. We have used two models: densely packed particles and bicontinuous media. For the case of densely packed particles, we used the Metropolis shuffling method to simulate the positions of particles. The particles are also allowed to have adhesive properties. The Foldy-Lax equations of multiple scattering are used to study scattering from the densely packed spherical particles. The results are illustrated for the coherent waves and incoherent waves. For the case of bicontinuous media, the method developed by Cahn is applied to construct the interfaces from a large number of stochastic sinusoidal waves with random phases and directions. The volume scattering problem is then solved by using CGS-FFT. We illustrate the results of frequency and polarization dependence of such dense media scattering.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Electromagnetic Computation in Scattering of Electromagnetic Waves by Random Rough Surface and Dense Media in Microwave Remote Sensing of Land Surfaces","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","doi":"10.1109/JPROC.2012.2214011","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5/6413192/06313880.pdf","startPage":"255","endPage":"279","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JPROC.2012.2214011","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6413192","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6313880","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6313880/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 September 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2013","displayDocTitle":"Electromagnetic Computation in Scattering of Electromagnetic Waves by Random Rough Surface and Dense Media in Microwave Remote Sensing of Land Surfaces","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"101","issue":"2","dateOfInsertion":"16 January 2013","publicationDate":"Feb. 2013","accessionNumber":"13234848","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Electromagnetic Computation in Scattering of Electromagnetic Waves by Random Rough Surface and Dense Media in Microwave Remote Sensing of Land Surfaces","sourcePdf":"jproc-tsang-2214011-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.054607S","chronDate":"Feb.  2013","isNumber":"6413192","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"51","articleId":"6313880","onlineDate":"27 September 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6313884,"authors":[{"name":"Dheeraj Mohata","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Dheeraj","lastName":"Mohata","id":"37393283600"},{"name":"Bijesh Rajamohanan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Bijesh","lastName":"Rajamohanan","id":"38468521400"},{"name":"Theresa Mayer","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Theresa","lastName":"Mayer","id":"37279064400"},{"name":"Mantu Hudait","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Blacksburg, VA, USA"],"firstName":"Mantu","lastName":"Hudait","id":"37266361900"},{"name":"Joel Fastenau","affiliation":["IQE, Inc., Bethlehem, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Joel","lastName":"Fastenau","id":"37281799800"},{"name":"Dmitri Lubyshev","affiliation":["IQE, Inc., Bethlehem, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Dmitri","lastName":"Lubyshev","id":"37281800400"},{"name":"Amy W.

This approach is based on the principle of the orthogonal-frequency-division-multiplexing technique. Unlike multiple subband approaches, the proposed scheme allows the generation of multiple orthogonal waveforms on common spectral support and thereby enables to exploit the full bandwidth for each waveform. This letter introduces the modulation and the demodulation processing in regard to typical spaceborne SAR receive signals.

The indentation-based nanomechanical measurement provides unique quantification of material properties at specified locations. The measurement, however, is currently too slow and too narrow in frequency (range) to characterize time-elapsing material properties during dynamic evolutions (e.g., the rapid-stage of the crystallization process of polymers). These limitations exist because the excitation input force used in current methods cannot rapidly excite broadband nanomechanical properties of materials. The challenges arise as a result of the instrumental hardware dynamics being excited and convoluted with the material properties during the measurement when the frequencies in the excitation force increase, resulting in large measurement errors. Moreover, measurement takes a long time when the frequency range is large, which, in turn, leads to large temporal measurement errors upon dynamic evolution of the sample. In this paper, we develop an optimal-input design approach to tackle these challenges. Particularly, an input force profile with discrete spectrum is optimized to maximize the Fisher information matrix of the linear compliance model of the soft material. Both simulation and experiments on a Poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) sample are presented to illustrate the need for optimal input design and the efficacy of the proposed approach in probe-based nanomechanical property measurements.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6313898/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 September 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6313898/","dateOfInsertion":"16 August 2013","publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","accessionNumber":"13706145","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"21","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Optimal Excitation Force Design in Indentation-Based Rapid Broadband Nanomechanical Spectroscopy: Poly(dimethylsiloxane) Example","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal Excitation Force Design in Indentation-Based Rapid Broadband Nanomechanical Spectroscopy: Poly(dimethylsiloxane) Example","sourcePdf":"tcst-zou-2212706-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.082816S","chronDate":"Sept.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"87","isNumber":"6578094","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"87","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6578094","articleId":"6313898","onlineDate":"27 September 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6313901,"authors":[{"name":"Vijay Devabhaktuni","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Toledo, Toledo, OH, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/15/6497105/6313901/6313901-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Vijay Devabhaktuni (S\u201997\u2013M\u201903\u2013SM\u201909) received the B.Eng. degree in electrical and electronic engineering and the M.Sc. degree in physics from the Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani, Rajasthan, in 1996, and the Ph.D. degree in electronics from Carleton University, Ottawa, ON, Canada, in 2003.

The proposed approach improves the accuracy of conventional or standard neural models by reversing the input-output variables in a systematic manner, while keeping the model structures simple relative to complex knowledge-based ANNs (e.g., KBNNs). The approach facilitates accurate and fast neural network modeling of realistic EMC scenarios where training data are expensive and sparse. To establish accuracy, efficiency, and feasibility of the proposed reverse-modeling approach, PCB structures such as perforated surface-mount shields and partially shielded PCB traces are treated as proof-of-concept examples. Although the modeling examples presented in the paper are based on training data from EM simulations, the approach is generic and hence valid for EMC modeling based on the measurement data. The approach is particularly useful in the electronic manufacturing industry where PCB layouts are frequently reused with minor modifications to the existing time-tested designs.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6313901/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 September 2012","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"13429710","volume":"55","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/6313901/","publicationDate":"April 2013","dateOfInsertion":"11 April 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A New ANN-Based Modeling Approach for Rapid EMI/EMC Analysis of PCB and Shielding Enclosures","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A New ANN-Based Modeling Approach for Rapid EMI/EMC Analysis of PCB and Shielding Enclosures","sourcePdf":"temc-bunting-2214223-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.091633S","chronDate":"April  2013","xplore-pub-id":"15","isNumber":"6497105","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"15","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"6497105","articleId":"6313901","onlineDate":"27 September 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-04"},{"_id":6313902,"authors":[{"name":"Mojtaba Khosravi-Farsani","affiliation":["Electromagnetics Research Laboratory, Amirkabir University of Technology, Tehran, Iran"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/15/6497105/6313902/6313902-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Mojtaba Khosravi-Farsani was born in Farsan, Iran, in 1986.

The return stroke channel is modeled using the antenna theory model with fixed inductive loading which is appropriately incorporated into the FDTD algorithm. First, the validity of the Cooray-Rubinstein (CR) formula for the evaluation of above-ground horizontal electric field is evaluated. The obtained results confirm the recent findings of Cooray according to which it is important to include propagation effects over a lossy ground in the magnetic field used in the CR formula, except at very close distance ranges for which propagation effects can be neglected. Second, we test the validity of the Cooray formula for the evaluation of underground horizontal electric fields. The Cooray formula allows for the evaluation of the underground horizontal electric field starting from the horizontal electric field at the air-soil interface. This latter can be calculated using either 1) the original CR formula in which the magnetic field at ground level is evaluated assuming the ground as a perfect conductor or 2) taking into account propagation effects in the computation of the magnetic field. We show that the assumption of a perfectly conducting ground for the evaluation of the magnetic field at ground level might lead to inaccuracies in the Cooray formula. However, the use of the Cooray formula taking into account propagation effects in the computation of the magnetic field results in acceptable predictions of the underground horizontal electric fields.","doi":"10.1109/TEMC.2012.2211364","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electromagnetic Compatibility","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electromagnetic Compatibility","pdfPath":"/iel5/15/6497105/06313902.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEMC.2012.2211364","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6497105","startPage":"362","endPage":"370","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Validity of Approximate Formulas for the Evaluation of the Lightning Electromagnetic Fields in the Presence of a Lossy Ground","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6313902","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"On the Validity of Approximate Formulas for the Evaluation of the Lightning Electromagnetic Fields in the Presence of a Lossy Ground","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6313902/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 September 2012","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"55","issue":"2","publicationDate":"April 2013","accessionNumber":"13429711","dateOfInsertion":"11 April 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6313902/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Validity of Approximate Formulas for the Evaluation of the Lightning Electromagnetic Fields in the Presence of a Lossy Ground","sourcePdf":"temc-moini-2211364-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.080217S","chronDate":"April  2013","xplore-pub-id":"15","isNumber":"6497105","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"15","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"6497105","articleId":"6313902","onlineDate":"27 September 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":6313904,"authors":[{"name":"Ali Abdullah","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Kuwait University, Khalidiya, Kuwait"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/6525345/6313904/6313904-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ali Abdullah received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from Kuwait University, Khaldiya, Kuwait, and the M.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from the University of Southern California, Los Angeles, in 2001 and 2005, respectively.","He is currently an Assistant Professor with the Department of Electrical Engineering, Kuwait University.

The LPV systems under consideration are subject to modeling uncertainties and depend on a set of parameters that are assumed to be bounded and available online. Three schemes are proposed to achieve sensor-fault-tolerant control. First, a low-order LPV observer is proposed to simultaneously estimate the unmeasured states and the sensor faults. Second, the estimated sensor faults are used to design a fault decision scheme to detect the sensor faults and to prevent false alarms caused by modeling uncertainties and/or measurement noise. Third, a fault-tolerant control scheme is designed by using the estimated states and the estimated sensor faults to compensate for the effects of sensor faults. To show the effectiveness of the proposed results, the developed schemes are applied to three practical examples consisting of a continuous stirred tank reactor, a single-link robotic arm, and a liquid level process. The simulation results for the first two examples and the experimental results for the liquid level process example indicate that the proposed schemes work well.","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2012.2219836","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2012.2219836","startPage":"5239","endPage":"5251","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/6525345/06313904.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6525345","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sensor-Fault-Tolerant Control for a Class of Linear Parameter Varying Systems With Practical Examples","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 September 2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2013","displayDocTitle":"Sensor-Fault-Tolerant Control for a Class of Linear Parameter Varying Systems With Practical Examples","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"06 June 2013","volume":"60","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6313904/","accessionNumber":"13563547","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6313904/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sensor-Fault-Tolerant Control for a Class of Linear Parameter Varying Systems With Practical Examples","sourcePdf":"tie-abdullah-2219836-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.101507S","chronDate":"Nov.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"6525345","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"35","xplore-issue":"6525345","articleId":"6313904","onlineDate":"27 September 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-07"},{"_id":6313905,"authors":[{"name":"Xing-Si Pu","affiliation":["Advanced Drive Technology Company Limited, Gunpo, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/6512583/6313905/6313905-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Xing-Si Pu was born in Yunnan, China, in 1986.

First, a controlled ac current component is injected into the input. Then, it induces ac voltage ripples on the dc output. By manipulating these ac voltage and current components with digital filters, the value of the ESR can be calculated, where the recursive least squares algorithm is used for reliable estimation results. In addition, the value of the ESR is corrected by considering the temperature effect, for which a simple temperature-sensing circuit has been designed. The simulation and experimental results show that the estimation error of the ESR is within a reasonable range, thereby enabling the determination of the appropriate time for the replacement of the capacitor.","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2012.2218561","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","startPage":"4118","endPage":"4127","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2012.2218561","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6512583","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/6512583/06313905.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Capacitors","Voltage measurement","Switches","Temperature measurement","Estimation","Current measurement","Temperature sensors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["AC-DC power convertors","condition monitoring","digital filters","electrolytic capacitors","fault diagnosis","least squares approximations","power capacitors","PWM power convertors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fault diagnosis","three-phase AC-DC PWM converters","equivalent series resistance online estimation","ESR","DC-link electrolytic capacitor","three-phase AC-DC pulsewidth-modulation converters","condition monitoring","controlled AC current component","AC voltage ripples","digital filters","recursive least squares algorithm","temperature effect","temperature-sensing circuit","ESR estimation error"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["AC/DC pulsewidth-modulation (PWM) converters","current measurement","dc-link capacitor","equivalent series resistance (ESR)","estimation","fault diagnosis","monitoring","recursive least squares (RLS)","temperature sensing"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Fault Diagnosis of DC-Link Capacitors in Three-Phase AC/DC PWM Converters by Online Estimation of Equivalent Series Resistance","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6313905/","volume":"60","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/6313905/","accessionNumber":"13484415","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"02 May 2013","publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 September 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2013","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fault Diagnosis of DC-Link Capacitors in Three-Phase AC/DC PWM Converters by Online Estimation of Equivalent Series Resistance","sourcePdf":"tie-lee-2218561-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.07319S","chronDate":"Sept.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"6512583","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"107","xplore-issue":"6512583","articleId":"6313905","onlineDate":"27 September 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6313906,"authors":[{"name":"Li Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Research Center for Energy Technology and Strategy, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/6472101/6313906/6313906-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Li Wang (S'87\u2013M'88\u2013SM'05) received the Ph.D. degree from the Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan, in 1988.","He has been an Associate Professor and a Professor at the Department of Electrical Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, in 1988 and 1995, respectively.

The operating characteristics of the studied two OWFs are simulated by an equivalent aggregated PMSG driven by an equivalent wind turbine (WT) and an equivalent aggregated DFIG driven by an equivalent WT through an equivalent gearbox, respectively. A damping controller of the SVC is designed by using adaptive-network-based fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) to contribute adequate damping characteristics to the dominant modes of the studied SG under various operating conditions. A frequency-domain approach based on a linearized system model using root-loci technique and a time-domain scheme based on a nonlinear system model subject to various disturbances are both utilized to examine the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.

Extensive measurement campaign in RF laboratories and in an anechoic chamber was performed for complete calibration and characterization of those active antenna arrays, resulting in the proposal of a new efficient procedure. To accomplish the calibration procedure, the expansion of equations of the proposed calibration algorithms, based on the proposed active antenna array model and the derivation of the scattering matrix from the active element pattern, is presented. These algorithms deal with mutual coupling effect and gain and phase errors, and in general, the overall procedure leads to a significant reduction in time and costs associated to the measurements of the antenna under test and the proposed calibration algorithm. Significant measurement results from the Certified Laboratory of Tests and Standardization of Antennas (LEHA) located in the Universidad Polit\u00e9cnica de Madrid are presented to validate the procedure.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6399626","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIM.2012.2217662","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","pdfPath":"/iel5/19/6399626/06313910.pdf","startPage":"377","endPage":"391","doi":"10.1109/TIM.2012.2217662","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Procedure for Measurement, Characterization, and Calibration of Active Antenna Arrays","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2013","displayDocTitle":"Procedure for Measurement, Characterization, and Calibration of Active Antenna Arrays","volume":"62","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/6313910/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2013","accessionNumber":"13191328","dateOfInsertion":"04 January 2013","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6313910/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 September 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Procedure for Measurement, Characterization, and Calibration of Active Antenna Arrays","sourcePdf":"tim-salasnatera-2217662-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.111551S","chronDate":"Feb.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"19","isNumber":"6399626","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"19","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"6399626","articleId":"6313910","onlineDate":"27 September 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6313911,"authors":[{"name":"Hai Liu","affiliation":["Science and Technology on Multi-spectral Information Processing Laboratory, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/19/6399626/6313911/6313911-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Hai Liu (S'12) received the B.S. degree in computational mathematics in XiangFan University, Xiangyang, China, in 2008 and the M.S. degree in applied mathematics from Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China, in 2010, where he is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree in the Institute for Pattern Recognition and Artificial Intelligence.","His current research interests include spectral analysis, deconvolution theory, and pattern recognition."]},"firstName":"Hai","lastName":"Liu","id":"37085682440"},{"name":"Luxin Yan","affiliation":["Science and Technology on Multi-spectral Information Processing Laboratory, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/19/6399626/6313911/6313911-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Luxin Yan (M'12) received the B.S. degree in electronic communication engineering and the the Ph.D. degree from Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST), Wuhan, China, in 2001 and 2007, respectively.","He is currently an Assistant Professor and Director with the Institute for Pattern Recognition and Artificial Intelligence, HUST.

Spectral deconvolution and feature-parameter extraction are both classical problems, which are known to be difficult and have attracted major research efforts. This paper shows that the two problems are tightly coupled and can be successfully solved together. Mutual support of Raman spectral deconvolution and feature-extraction processes within a joint variational framework are theoretically motivated and validated by successful experimental results. The main idea is to recover latent spectrum and extract spectral feature parameters from slit-distorted Raman spectrum simultaneously. Moreover, a robust adaptive Tikhonov regularization function is suggested to distinguish the flat, noise, and points, which can suppress noise effectively as well as preserve details. To evaluate the performance of the proposed method, quantitative and qualitative analyses were carried out by visual inspection and quality indexes of the simulated and real Raman spectra.","doi":"10.1109/TIM.2012.2217636","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","pdfPath":"/iel5/19/6399626/06313911.pdf","startPage":"315","endPage":"327","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIM.2012.2217636","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6399626","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spectral Deconvolution and Feature Extraction With Robust Adaptive Tikhonov Regularization","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6313911","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 September 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6313911/","displayDocTitle":"Spectral Deconvolution and Feature Extraction With Robust Adaptive Tikhonov Regularization","volume":"62","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 2013","accessionNumber":"13191329","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6313911/","dateOfInsertion":"04 January 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spectral Deconvolution and Feature Extraction With Robust Adaptive Tikhonov Regularization","sourcePdf":"tim-yan-2217636-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.078582S","chronDate":"Feb.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"19","isNumber":"6399626","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"19","citationCount":"78","xplore-issue":"6399626","articleId":"6313911","onlineDate":"27 September 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-30"},{"_id":6313917,"authors":[{"name":"Bipul Luitel","affiliation":["Real-Time Power and Intelligent Systems Laboratory, Holcombe Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Clemson University, Clemson, SC, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5962385/6331030/6313917/6313917-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Bipul Luitel (S'08\u2013M'12) received the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in computer engineering from the Missouri University of Science & Technology, Rolla, in 2009 and 2012, respectively.","He is currently a Post-Doctoral Fellow with Clemson University, Clemson, SC.

These cells interact with each other in order to fulfill a common goal. The current methods involved in learning of CNNs are usually centralized (cells are trained in one location) and synchronous (all cells are trained simultaneously either sequentially or in parallel depending on the available hardware/software platform). In this paper, a generic architecture of CNNs is presented and a special case of supervised learning is demonstrated explaining the internal components of a cell. A decentralized asynchronous learning (DAL) framework for CNNs is developed in which each cell of the CNN learns in a spatially and temporally distributed environment. An application of DAL framework is demonstrated by developing a CNN-based wide-area monitoring system for power systems. The results obtained are compared against equivalent traditional methods and shown to be better in terms of accuracy and speed.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6313917/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 September 2012","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"13057106","pubMedId":"24808070","volume":"23","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/6313917/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"15 October 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Decentralized Asynchronous Learning in Cellular Neural Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Decentralized Asynchronous Learning in Cellular Neural Networks","sourcePdf":"tnnls-luitel-2216900-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.091836S","chronDate":"Nov.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"5962385","isNumber":"6331030","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5962385","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"6331030","articleId":"6313917","onlineDate":"27 September 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-02"},{"_id":6313925,"authors":[{"name":"Congzhe Gao","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China","Automation School, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/6361328/6313925/6313925-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Congzhe Gao was born in Hebei, China, in 1984.

It has been shown that a small fraction of the overall measurements are sufficient to reconstruct images with the combination of compressed sensing and parallel imaging. Various reconstruction algorithms have been proposed for compressed sensing, among which augmented Lagrangian based methods have been shown to often perform better than others for many different applications. In this paper, we propose new augmented Lagrangian based solutions to the compressed sensing reconstruction problem with analysis and synthesis prior formulations. We also propose a computational method which makes use of properties of the sampling pattern and the singular value decomposition of the system transfer function to significantly improve the speed of the reconstruction for the proposed algorithms in Cartesian sampled MRI. The proposed algorithms are shown to outperform earlier methods especially for the case of dynamic MRI for which the transfer function tends to be a very large matrix and significantly ill conditioned. It is also demonstrated that the proposed algorithm can be accelerated much further than other methods in case of a parallel implementation with graphics processing units.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Emerging and Selected Topics in Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5503868/6374660/06313929.pdf","startPage":"370","endPage":"379","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Emerging and Selected Topics in Circuits and Systems","doi":"10.1109/JETCAS.2012.2217032","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JETCAS.2012.2217032","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6374660","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6313929","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High-Speed Compressed Sensing Reconstruction in Dynamic Parallel MRI Using Augmented Lagrangian and Parallel Processing","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Magnetic resonance imaging","Compressed sensing","Algorithm design and analysis","Image reconstruction","Heuristic algorithms","Fourier transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomedical MRI","graphics processing units","image reconstruction","image resolution","parallel processing","singular value decomposition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compressed sensing reconstruction","dynamic parallel MRI","augmented lagrangian","parallel processing","magnetic resonance imaging","image resolution","parallel imaging","augmented Lagrangian based method","computational method","singular value decomposition","system transfer function","Cartesian sampled MRI","dynamic MRI","graphics processing unit"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Compressed sensing","magnetic resonance imaging","parallel processing"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6313929/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 September 2012","displayDocTitle":"High-Speed Compressed Sensing Reconstruction in Dynamic Parallel MRI Using Augmented Lagrangian and Parallel Processing","volume":"2","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/6313929/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2012","accessionNumber":"13167802","dateOfInsertion":"27 December 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High-Speed Compressed Sensing Reconstruction in Dynamic Parallel MRI Using Augmented Lagrangian and Parallel Processing","sourcePdf":"jetcas-bilen-2217032-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.115051S","chronDate":"Sept.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"5503868","isNumber":"6374660","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5503868","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"6374660","articleId":"6313929","onlineDate":"27 September 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6313932,"authors":[{"name":"Samuel Shapero","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Samuel Shapero (S'04\u2013M'05)) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electrical engineering from Stanford University, Stanford, CA, in 2005 and 2006, respectively, and is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree in bioengineering at the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta.","His current research focuses on low power analog circuit design, nonvolatile programmable circuits, neural modeling and sparse coding in both software and VLSI systems.

In this paper, a novel time-frequency signal structure is proposed to improve the system performance of TDS-OFDM over fast time-varying channels. Each TDS-OFDM symbol adopts the time-domain one-sample shifted training sequence (TS) and the frequency-domain grouped pilots as the time-frequency training information. The modulable orthogonal sequence (MOS) with perfect autocorrelation property is adopted as the TS, while each pilot group has only one non-zero central pilot surrounded by several zero pilots. The corresponding joint time-frequency channel estimation utilizes the time-domain TS for path delay estimation and the frequency-domain grouped pilots for path gain estimation, thus accurate tracking of the fast time-varying wireless channel could be achieved. Only about 1% of the total subcarriers will be occupied by the redundant grouped pilots, thus the loss in spectral efficiency is negligible. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme outperforms the conventional solutions over fast fading channels.","doi":"10.1109/TBC.2012.2219231","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting","pdfPath":"/iel5/11/6469242/06313944.pdf","startPage":"168","endPage":"173","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBC.2012.2219231","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6469242","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint Time-Frequency Channel Estimation for Time Domain Synchronous OFDM Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6313944","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 September 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6313944/","displayDocTitle":"Joint Time-Frequency Channel Estimation for Time Domain Synchronous OFDM Systems","volume":"59","issue":"1","publicationDate":"March 2013","accessionNumber":"13325787","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6313944/","dateOfInsertion":"22 February 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint Time-Frequency Channel Estimation for Time Domain Synchronous OFDM Systems","sourcePdf":"tbc-dai-2219231-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.076318S","chronDate":"March  2013","xplore-pub-id":"11","isNumber":"6469242","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"11","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"6469242","articleId":"6313944","onlineDate":"27 September 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6313947,"authors":[{"name":"Sung Ik Park","affiliation":["Broadcasting System Research Department, Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Sung Ik","lastName":"Park","id":"37280893600"},{"name":"Heung Mook Kim","affiliation":["Broadcasting System Research Department, Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Heung Mook","lastName":"Kim","id":"37292766600"},{"name":"Yiyan Wu","affiliation":["Communications Rcscarch Centre, Ottawa, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Yiyan","lastName":"Wu","id":"37281231400"},{"name":"Jeongchang Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communications Engineering, Korea Maritime University, Busan, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jeongchang","lastName":"Kim","id":"37293495200"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9316"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9611"}],"articleNumber":"6313947","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":267},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Broadcast Technology Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/organizations/society/bt/"}],"abstract":"In this paper, we propose a novel augmented data transmission (ADT) system based on low density parity check (LDPC) code for an additional data stream transmission in the Advanced Television Systems Committee (ATSC) terrestrial digital television system.

The proposed BSLM scheme embeds the side information identifying a phase sequence into itself by giving the optimal phase offset to the elements of each phase sequence, which are determined by the biorthogonal vectors for the partitioned subblocks. When \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">U</i>\n phase sequences and maximum likelihood decoder are used, the proposed BSLM scheme reduces the decoding complexity by (\n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">U</i>\n-2)/\n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">U</i>\n compared with the conventional BSLM scheme. Also, pairwise error probability (PEP) analysis for the proposed BSLM scheme is performed over the fading channel. Based on the PEP analysis, the bit error rate (BER) performance of the proposed BSLM scheme is shown to be determined by the subblock partitioning and phase offset. Finally, it is shown that for QPSK and 16-QAM, the detection failure probability and the BER of the proposed BSLM scheme are almost the same as those of the conventional BSLM scheme through numerical analysis.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A New Blind SLM Scheme With Low Decoding Complexity for OFDM Systems","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting","doi":"10.1109/TBC.2012.2216472","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting","pdfPath":"/iel5/11/6351840/06313948.pdf","startPage":"669","endPage":"676","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBC.2012.2216472","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6351840","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6313948","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6313948/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 September 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2012","displayDocTitle":"A New Blind SLM Scheme With Low Decoding Complexity for OFDM Systems","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"58","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/6313948/","dateOfInsertion":"16 November 2012","publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","accessionNumber":"13136055","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A New Blind SLM Scheme With Low Decoding Complexity for OFDM Systems","sourcePdf":"tbc-shin-2216472-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.072908S","chronDate":"Dec.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"11","isNumber":"6351840","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"11","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"6351840","articleId":"6313948","onlineDate":"27 September 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6313949,"authors":[{"name":"Keqian Yan","affiliation":["Tsinghua National Laboratory for Information Science and Technology (TNList) and the Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/11/6351840/6313949/6313949-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Keqian Yan received the B.S.E. degree from the Department of Electronic Engineering in Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China, in 2010.

Intermittent power sources, in particular, require mitigation strategies in order to maintain consistent power on the electric grid. We investigate distributed energy storage as one such strategy. Our model for optimal power flow with storage augments the usual formulation by adding simple charge/discharge dynamics for energy storage collocated with load and/or generation buses cast as a finite-time optimal control problem. We first propose a solution strategy that uses a convex optimization based relaxation to solve the optimal control problem. We then use this framework to illustrate the effects of various levels of energy storage using the topology of IEEE benchmark systems along with both time-invariant and demand-based cost functions. The addition of energy storage and demand-based cost functions significantly reduces the generation costs and flattens the generation profiles.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6313956/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 September 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2013","publicationDate":"May 2013","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6313956/","dateOfInsertion":"18 April 2013","accessionNumber":"13934174","volume":"28","issue":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Optimal power flow with large-scale storage integration","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal power flow with large-scale storage integration","sourcePdf":"tpwrs-gayme-2212286-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073852S","chronDate":"May  2013","xplore-pub-id":"59","isNumber":"6504806","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"140","xplore-issue":"6504806","articleId":"6313956","onlineDate":"27 September 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6313959,"authors":[{"name":"Huijuan Li","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, The University of Tennessee (UT), Knoxville, TN, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Huijuan Li (S'07\u2013M'11) received the Ph.D. degree from The University of Tennessee (UT) at Knoxville in 2010.","She is presently a postdoc research associate with Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), Oak Ridge, TN.","Ms. Li won the First Place Prize award at the Student Poster Contest during the IEEE PES General Meeting, Calgary, AB, Canada, in July 2009."]},"firstName":"Huijuan","lastName":"Li","id":"37407176500"},{"name":"Fangxing Li","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, The University of Tennessee (UT), Knoxville, TN, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Fangxing (Fran) Li (M'01\u2013SM'05) received the Ph.D. degree from Virginia Tech, Blacksburg, in 2001.","He is presently an Associate Professor at The University of Tennessee (UT) at Knoxville and the Director of the Education Program of the CURENT research center.

Theoretical analysis shows that there exists a corresponding formulation of the dynamic control parameters with multiple DEs to give the desired responses. Therefore, the proposed control method has a solid theoretical basis. The method is based on dynamically and adaptively adjusting DE control parameters to ensure that actual voltage responses follow the desired outputs. Also, it is based on local and the other DEs' voltages without the need of the full system data and extensive studies to tune the control parameters. Hence, the method is autonomous and adaptive for variable operational situations, and has the plug-and-play feature with a high tolerance to unavailable or inaccurate system data. Thus, it is suitable for broad utility application. Simulation results from various conditions, such as asynchronous start of multiple DEs, disappearance of the original disturbance in the middle of the control process, and operation in looped distribution systems, confirm the performance, validity, and flexibility of the proposed control method. The possible impact of communication latency on the performance of the proposed method is also discussed.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Autonomous and adaptive voltage control using multiple distributed energy resources","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","doi":"10.1109/TPWRS.2012.2213276","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/59/6504806/06313959.pdf","startPage":"718","endPage":"730","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRS.2012.2213276","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6504806","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6313959","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6313959/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 September 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2013","displayDocTitle":"Autonomous and adaptive voltage control using multiple distributed energy resources","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"28","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/6313959/","dateOfInsertion":"18 April 2013","publicationDate":"May 2013","accessionNumber":"13934203","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Autonomous and adaptive voltage control using multiple distributed energy resources","sourcePdf":"tpwrs-li-2213276-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.108294S","chronDate":"May  2013","xplore-pub-id":"59","isNumber":"6504806","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"43","xplore-issue":"6504806","articleId":"6313959","onlineDate":"27 September 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"USGov","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6313961,"authors":[{"name":"Mostafa F.

In each iteration, EVs update their charging profiles according to the control signal broadcast by the utility company, and the utility company alters the control signal to guide their updates. The algorithm converges to optimal charging profiles (that are as \u201cflat\u201d as they can possibly be) irrespective of the specifications (e.g., maximum charging rate and deadline) of EVs, even if EVs do not necessarily update their charging profiles in every iteration, and use potentially outdated control signal when they update.

The integration of variable and uncertain renewable generation sources, such as wind, increases the flexibility needed to maintain the load-generation balance. This paper aims to provide a systematic approach to evaluate the flexibility level and investigate the role of flexibility in generation planning and market operation. An \u201coffline\u201d index is proposed to estimate the technical ability of both the individual generators and the generation mix to provide the required flexibility. A dedicated unit construction and commitment (UCC) algorithm, able to consider plant investment and operation costs, is developed to determine the optimal investments in flexible generating units. Market simulation models are then implemented to determine the profits obtained from providing flexibility in different market designs. An adapted RTS-96 system is used to test the proposed models and the flexibility metric. Results demonstrate the validity of the UCC algorithm and the coherence of the proposed flexibility index. The analysis of the profits of flexibility shows that the market design plays an important role in the efficient deployment and subsequent profitability of flexibility

Exploiting the sparsity, a channel estimate can be obtained by using a matching pursuit (MP) algorithm. To improve the performance of MP algorithm based estimation, the orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) algorithm for channel estimation is proposed. In OMP, the re-selection problem of MP algorithm is avoided by using the stored dictionary at each iteration, and faster convergence to a sparse solution is obtained. we proposed to use MP algorithm based on Pseudorandom Sequences for training sequences for channel estimation. Using the proposed method, the main taps distorted by the projection of other taps is eliminated by the dictionary with orthogonal property, and more accurate channel estimates can be obtained. The results of channel estimates by using MP, OMP and the proposed method are compared, verifying that the proposed method outperforms the MP and OMP methods, with the same computational complexity as MP algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/GSMM.2012.6314001","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6313975","startPage":"33","endPage":"37","pdfPath":"/iel5/6302082/6313975/06314001.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 2012 5th Global Symposium on Millimeter-Waves","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 2012 5th Global Symposium on Millimeter-Waves","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GSMM.2012.6314001","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Matching pursuit based sparse channel estimation using Pseudorandom Sequences","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Matching pursuit algorithms","Channel estimation","Vectors","Dictionaries","Estimation","Approximation algorithms","Training"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["broadcast communication","channel estimation","computational complexity","random sequences"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sparse channel estimation","pseudorandom sequences","large delay","nonzero taps","hilly broadcast wireless communications","matching pursuit algorithm","orthogonal matching pursuit","OMP algorithm","stored dictionary","sparse solution","training sequences","computational complexity"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MP","Pseudorandom Sequences","Channel Estimation","OMP"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 May 2012","displayDocTitle":"Matching pursuit based sparse channel estimation using Pseudorandom Sequences","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6314001/","dateOfInsertion":"27 September 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6314001/","accessionNumber":"13035190","publicationDate":"May 2012","conferenceDate":"27-30 May 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Matching pursuit based sparse channel estimation using Pseudorandom Sequences","confLoc":"Harbin, China","sourcePdf":"040919.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041148S","chronDate":"27-30 May 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6302082","isNumber":"6313975","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6302082","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6313975","articleId":"6314001","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6314002,"authors":[{"name":"Xin Zhao","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory of Science and Technology on Communications, UESTC, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Xin","lastName":"Zhao","id":"38488522800"},{"name":"Lidong Zhu","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory of Science and Technology on Communications, UESTC, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Lidong","lastName":"Zhu","id":"37276567000"},{"name":"Yantao Guo","affiliation":["Science and Technology on Information Transmission and Dissemination in Communication Networks Laboratory, 54th Research Institute of CETC, Shijiazhuang, Hebei, China"],"firstName":"Yantao","lastName":"Guo","id":"38488655100"},{"name":"Xiaogang Gou","affiliation":["Science and Technology on Information Transmission and Dissemination in Communication Networks Laboratory, 54th Research Institute of CETC, Shijiazhuang, Hebei, China"],"firstName":"Xiaogang","lastName":"Gou","id":"38488526900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1305-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1302-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-1304-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6314002","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":280},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6314002","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Parity check codes","Standards","Receivers","Algorithm design and analysis","Bit rate","Decoding","Bit error rate"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cyclic codes","error statistics","parity check codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["QC-LDPC codes","dual-diagonal structure","IEEE802.16e standard","bit-rate compatibility","subcodes","BER performance","random puncturing","order puncturing"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Low Density Parity-Check Code","dual-diagonal","rate compatible","puncturing"]}],"abstract":"Puncturing is an effective method to achieve rate compatible.

The simulation shows that the proposed puncturing algorithm is simple and effective, and the sub-codes obtained through the puncturing have better BER performance than that of random puncturing and order puncturing. In addition, because the puncturing matrix does not need to send to the receiver, it reduces a lot of overhead. Overall, the proposed puncturing algorithm is very practical to achieve rate compatible.","doi":"10.1109/GSMM.2012.6314002","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6313975","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GSMM.2012.6314002","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 2012 5th Global Symposium on Millimeter-Waves","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 2012 5th Global Symposium on Millimeter-Waves","pdfPath":"/iel5/6302082/6313975/06314002.pdf","startPage":"38","endPage":"42","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An effective puncturing algorithm for QC-LDPC codes with dual-diagonal structure","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"27-30 May 2012","displayDocTitle":"An effective puncturing algorithm for QC-LDPC codes with dual-diagonal structure","isConference":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 May 2012","dateOfInsertion":"27 September 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6314002/","publicationDate":"May 2012","accessionNumber":"13035191","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6314002/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An effective puncturing algorithm for QC-LDPC codes with dual-diagonal structure","confLoc":"Harbin, China","sourcePdf":"040930.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.16918S","chronDate":"27-30 May 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6302082","isNumber":"6313975","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6302082","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6313975","articleId":"6314002","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6314003,"authors":[{"name":"Changfei Zhou","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Changfei","lastName":"Zhou","id":"38488736000"},{"name":"Jiahui Fu","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Jiahui","lastName":"Fu","id":"37334873600"},{"name":"Yuanming Guo","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Yuanming","lastName":"Guo","id":"38488654600"},{"name":"Qun Wu","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Qun","lastName":"Wu","id":"37276588400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1305-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1302-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-1304-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6314003","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":108},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Time domain analysis","Frequency domain analysis","Finite difference methods","Surface impedance","Transient analysis","Broadband communication","Broadband antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electromagnetic wave scattering","finite difference time-domain analysis","frequency-domain analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["time domain transformation","frequency domain transformation","FDTD algorithm","finite-difference time-domain","far zone scattered field"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["FDTD","near zone","far zone","time domain","frequency domain"]}],"abstract":"Thefinite-difference time-domain (FDTD) algorithm could only calculate the fields offinite region.

Whereas the previous works assumed a model of plane wavefronts, here, a local scattering in the source or receiver vicinity is considered, thereby broadening the range of applications in real-world environments. Taking into account the local scattering, these CB techniques aim to maintain the beamforming response in the desired direction equal to unity. It is shown that the so-obtained collaborative beamformers are not suitable for a distributed implementation. We hence propose a novel beamformer solution that can be implemented in a distributed fashion and, further, well-approximates both transmit and receive collaborative beam-formers. The performance of the proposed distributed CB (DCB) technique is analyzed and its advantages against the conventional DCB technique, which is designed without taking into account the presence of local scattering in the source or receiver vicinity, are analytically proved and further verified by simulations.","doi":"10.1109/IWCMC.2012.6314168","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 8th International Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing Conference (IWCMC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6299140/6314161/06314168.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6314161","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IWCMC.2012.6314168","publicationTitle":"2012 8th International Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing Conference (IWCMC)","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed collaborative beamforming with minimum overhead for local scattering environments","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6314168","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-31 Aug. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Distributed collaborative beamforming with minimum overhead for local scattering environments","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6314168/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6314168/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2012","accessionNumber":"13029564","dateOfInsertion":"27 September 2012","conferenceDate":"27-31 Aug. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed collaborative beamforming with minimum overhead for local scattering environments","confLoc":"Limassol, Cyprus","sourcePdf":"0012153.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066536S","chronDate":"27-31 Aug. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6299140","isNumber":"6314161","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6299140","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"6314161","articleId":"6314168","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6314172,"authors":[{"name":"Imad E.

However, considering only one of these parameters does not yield an optimum design, which is needed for efficient cost-effective planning with the required quality of service (QoS). Moreover, this problem becomes extremely challenging in highly dynamic environments such as airports, shopping malls and train stations where both spatial and temporal traffic variations are considerably high. Due to the continuous growth in international air traffic and the dynamic behaviour of passengers in an airport environment, providing reliable and cost-effective communication facilities to passengers and staff becomes even more difficult at different times and locations. Using data from Heathrow Terminal 4 (T4), we, in this paper, develop T4 passenger flow models which take both the spatial and temporal variations into account and help us accurately determine the traffic demand (TD), coverage area and path loss and thus outage and energy consumption. Moreover, we propose a multi-objective genetic algorithm (GA) which serves traffic demand and minimises both outage and energy consumption of the whole network. This eventually minimises the number of BSs while optimising their locations. The results reveal that only a few (i.e. 1-4) more base stations are required when we consider all three parameters together compared to the TD only. However our proposed GA, considering TD, outage and energy consumption, achieves lower outage and consumes almost 90% less transmission energy compared to the case of TD only while serving the same amount of traffic in such a dynamic environment.","doi":"10.1109/IWCMC.2012.6314172","startPage":"24","endPage":"29","publicationTitle":"2012 8th International Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing Conference (IWCMC)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IWCMC.2012.6314172","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6314161","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 8th International Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing Conference (IWCMC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6299140/6314161/06314172.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Base stations locations optimisation in an airport environment using genetic algorithms","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6314172/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Base stations locations optimisation in an airport environment using genetic algorithms","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6314172/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"13029568","publicationDate":"Aug. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"27 September 2012","conferenceDate":"27-31 Aug. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-31 Aug. 2012","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Base stations locations optimisation in an airport environment using genetic algorithms","confLoc":"Limassol, Cyprus","sourcePdf":"0051981.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077557S","chronDate":"27-31 Aug. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6299140","isNumber":"6314161","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6299140","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6314161","articleId":"6314172","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6314176,"authors":[{"name":"Mikhail Zolotukhin","affiliation":["Department of Mathematical Information Technology, University of Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4, Jyvaskyla, Finland"],"firstName":"Mikhail","lastName":"Zolotukhin","id":"38230388000"},{"name":"Timo H\u00e4m\u00e4l\u00e4inen","affiliation":["Department of Mathematical Information Technology, University of Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4, Jyvaskyla, Finland"],"firstName":"Timo","lastName":"H\u00e4m\u00e4l\u00e4inen","id":"37269442700"},{"name":"Antti Juvonen","affiliation":["Department of Mathematical Information Technology, University of Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4, Jyvaskyla, Finland"],"firstName":"Antti","lastName":"Juvonen","id":"38488433800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1379-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1378-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-1377-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2376-6492"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2376-6506"}],"articleNumber":"6314176","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":495},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Vectors","Neurons","Training","Numerical models","Testing","Servers","Quantization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer network security","hypermedia","Internet","self-organising feature maps"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["online anomaly detection","N-gram model","growing hierarchical self-organizing maps","online detection","anomalous HTTP requests","GHSOM","network logs","feature matrices","anomalous requests","Web server","online malicious attacks detection","continuously updated Web-applications"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Data mining","intrusion detection","anomaly detection","n-gram","growing hierarchical self-organizing map"]}],"abstract":"In this research, online detection of anomalous HTTP requests is carried out with Growing Hierarchical Self-Organizing Maps (GHSOMs).

However, complex radio environment makes the employment of virtualization in wireless networks become a difficult problem, in which strict isolation across different experiments is hard to maintain. What is more, present radio experimental systems mostly exploit only Time Division Multiplexing, which may cause resources waste when the scale of experiments is relatively small. In this paper, we propose a time-space combined resources allocation scheme by taking advantage of both Time Division Multiplexing and Space Division Multiplexing. In this scheme, we first select a new time slot and some unscheduled experiments. Then we adopt Space Division Multiplexing to fit in as many experiments as possible in a time slot while ensuring required isolation across them. Extensive simulation shows that our scheme improves experimental resources utilization effectively, while each experiment in the same time slot have enough bandwidth among all nodes and the fairness of resources utility is also ensured.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Time division multiplexing","Topology","Resource management","Interference","Wireless networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC:

In this work, we focus on the design of a new opportunistic cross-layer MAC protocol involving channels allocation and packet scheduling for cognitive networks in order to optimize system performance. Cognitive radio provides the opportunity for secondary users (unlicensed users) to use available portions of the licensed spectrum bands without interfering with primary users (licensed users). We consider that each secondary user is equipped with two transceivers. The role of the first transceiver is to obtain and exchange channels information on the control channel. The second transceiver is devoted to periodically detect and dynamically use the available data channels. The paper deals with channel allocation considering traffic characteristics of secondary users. So, we propose a mechanism of resource reservation to improve Quality of Service (QoS) requirements that favors successful secondary users to transmit data during x time slots without interfering with primary users. We develop a new analytical model, while taking into account the backoff mechanism. We analyze delay parameter for two scenarios with and without resource reservation. We show through simulations that our approach guarantees an optimal response delay.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IWCMC.2012.6314179","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6314161","startPage":"65","endPage":"70","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 8th International Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing Conference (IWCMC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6299140/6314161/06314179.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"New insights from a delay analysis for cognitive radio networks with and without reservation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6314179/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-31 Aug. 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6314179/","displayDocTitle":"New insights from a delay analysis for cognitive radio networks with and without reservation","conferenceDate":"27-31 Aug. 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2012","accessionNumber":"13029575","dateOfInsertion":"27 September 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"New insights from a delay analysis for cognitive radio networks with and without reservation","confLoc":"Limassol, Cyprus","sourcePdf":"0127583.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077877S","chronDate":"27-31 Aug. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6299140","isNumber":"6314161","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6299140","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"6314161","articleId":"6314179","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6314190,"authors":[{"name":"Ba Lam To","affiliation":["University Pierre and Marie Curie, Paris, France"],"firstName":"Ba","lastName":"Lam To","id":"37996162600"},{"name":"Thi Mai Trang Nguyen","affiliation":["University Pierre and Marie Curie, Paris, France"],"firstName":"Thi Mai Trang","lastName":"Nguyen","id":"38607004600"},{"name":"Guy Pujolle","affiliation":["University Pierre and Marie Curie, Paris, France"],"firstName":"Guy","lastName":"Pujolle","id":"37277718200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1379-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1378-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-1377-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2376-6492"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2376-6506"}],"articleNumber":"6314190","dbTime":"22 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":126},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Signal to noise ratio","Receivers","Power control","Transmitters","Interference constraints","Measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ad hoc networks","cognitive radio","computational complexity","convex programming","geometric programming","maintenance engineering","power control","quality of service","radio links","radio receivers","radio transmitters","telecommunication congestion control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["flow-based power control scheme","cognitive radio ad-hoc network","CRN","primary user","secondary user transmission","SU transmission","interference constraint","PU receiver","quality of service constraint","QoS constraint","SU transmitter","power transmission","concurrent SU flow number maximization","power allocation","data flow maintenance","minimum flow capacity maximization","FBPC","computational complexity","flow combination metric","geometric convex program","two-phase flow maintenance"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["cognitive radio network","power control","flow-based"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6314190","doi":"10.1109/IWCMC.2012.6314190","publicationTitle":"2012 8th International Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing Conference (IWCMC)","abstract":"In Cognitive Radio Networks (CRN), the appearance of more active primary users (PUs) might require blocking of one or more secondary user (SU) transmissions to maintain interference constraints at PU receivers and Quality of Service (QoS) constraints of SUs. In general, SU transmitters need to adjust their transmission powers to maintain these constraints at all times. In this paper, we are interested in maximizing the number of concurrent SU flows under new PU arrivals and performing power allocation for SU links belonging to maintained data flows to maximize the minimum flow capacity. In particular, we develop a flow maintenance and power control scheme to solve this problem, which is referred to as Flow-Based Power Control (FBPC). The proposed scheme comprises two phases where we attempt to find a best set of flows with maximum size in the first phase and maximize the minimum flow capacity through power control in the second phase. To reduce computation complexity required in the first phase, we develop a flow combination metric, which is used to find the best flow combination. Moreover, we formulate power allocation problem that maximizes the minimum flow capacity and show how to transform it into a geometric convex program. Numerical results are presented to show the efficiency of the proposed flow combination metric and the desirable performance of the proposed two-phase flow maintenance and power control scheme.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IWCMC.2012.6314190","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6314161","startPage":"130","endPage":"135","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 8th International Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing Conference (IWCMC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6299140/6314161/06314190.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Flow-based power control in Cognitive Radio ad-hoc Network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6314190/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-31 Aug. 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6314190/","displayDocTitle":"Flow-based power control in Cognitive Radio ad-hoc Network","conferenceDate":"27-31 Aug. 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2012","accessionNumber":"13029585","dateOfInsertion":"27 September 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Flow-based power control in Cognitive Radio ad-hoc Network","confLoc":"Limassol, Cyprus","sourcePdf":"0235767.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.0616S","chronDate":"27-31 Aug. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6299140","isNumber":"6314161","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6299140","xplore-issue":"6314161","articleId":"6314190","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6314193,"authors":[{"name":"Marios Raspopoulos","affiliation":["Sigint Solutions Limited, Nicosia, Cyprus"],"firstName":"Marios","lastName":"Raspopoulos","id":"37688921100"},{"name":"Christos Laoudias","affiliation":["KIOS Research Center for Intelligent Systems and Networks, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Cyprus, Cyprus"],"firstName":"Christos","lastName":"Laoudias","id":"37393147100"},{"name":"Loizos Kanaris","affiliation":["Sigint Solutions Limited, Nicosia, Cyprus"],"firstName":"Loizos","lastName":"Kanaris","id":"38468466800"},{"name":"Akis Kokkinis","affiliation":["Sigint Solutions Limited, Nicosia, Cyprus"],"firstName":"Akis","lastName":"Kokkinis","id":"37937953500"},{"name":"Christos G.

In addition to the fact that RSS data collection might be a tedious and time-consuming process, the measured radiomap accuracy and applicability is subject to potential changes in the wireless environment. Therefore, RT becomes a very suitable and efficient solution to tackle this problem. Moreover, in traditional fingerprint-based methods, the underlying radiomap is restricted to the mobile device for which the radiomap has been created. To overcome this limitation, we propose the use of linear data transformation to match the characteristics of various devices. We address both challenges by using 3D RT-generated radiomaps and highlight the efficiency of this approach in terms of the time spent to create the radiomap, the amount of data required to calibrate the radiomap for different devices and the positioning error which is compared against the case of using dedicated radiomaps collected with each device.","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 8th International Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing Conference (IWCMC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6299140/6314161/06314193.pdf","startPage":"147","endPage":"152","publicationTitle":"2012 8th International Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing Conference (IWCMC)","doi":"10.1109/IWCMC.2012.6314193","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IWCMC.2012.6314193","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6314161","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6314193","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cross device fingerprint-based positioning using 3D Ray Tracing","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Calibration","Ray tracing","Accuracy","Performance evaluation","Training","Training data","Position measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3G mobile communication","ray tracing","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cross device fingerprint-based positioning","3D ray tracing","WLAN received signal strength","calibration techniques","RSS data collection","radiomap","mobile device"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6314193/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-31 Aug. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Cross device fingerprint-based positioning using 3D Ray Tracing","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6314193/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2012","accessionNumber":"13029588","dateOfInsertion":"27 September 2012","conferenceDate":"27-31 Aug. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cross device fingerprint-based positioning using 3D Ray Tracing","confLoc":"Limassol, Cyprus","sourcePdf":"0267195.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.088491S","chronDate":"27-31 Aug. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6299140","isNumber":"6314161","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6299140","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6314161","articleId":"6314193","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6314197,"authors":[{"name":"Yi Liu","affiliation":["School of Elect. & Inform.

This requires each SU to start cooperations at the same time by stopping their own transmissions. In multi-hop cognitive radio networks, it is very difficult to keep all SUs synchronized with others for sensing. In this paper, we propose an asynchronous cooperative sensing scheme for multi-hop cognitive radio networks in which each SU only provides its energy information in stead of ceasing its own transmission to perform the cooperative sensing. Each energy information is assigned an appropriate weight by considering the temporal and spatial diversities of each SU. We formulate the probabilities of detection and false alarm as optimization problems to find the optimal weight for every energy information. The achievable throughput has been derived. Numerical results show that the proposed scheme is able to achieve substantially higher throughput compared with the existing schemes.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"27-31 Aug. 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6314197/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"13029592","publicationDate":"Aug. 2012","conferenceDate":"27-31 Aug. 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6314197/","dateOfInsertion":"27 September 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Asynchronous cooperative spectrum sensing in multi-hop cognitive radio networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Asynchronous cooperative spectrum sensing in multi-hop cognitive radio networks","confLoc":"Limassol, Cyprus","sourcePdf":"0303525.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049315S","chronDate":"27-31 Aug. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6299140","isNumber":"6314161","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6299140","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6314161","articleId":"6314197","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6314200,"authors":[{"name":"Sayeb Rahima","affiliation":["Communication Systems Lab, ENIT, Manar University, Tunisia"],"firstName":"Sayeb","lastName":"Rahima","id":"37973050100"},{"name":"Noureddine Hamdi","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Mathematics, INSAT, Carthage University, Tunisia"],"firstName":"Noureddine","lastName":"Hamdi","id":"37395296200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1379-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1378-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-1377-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2376-6492"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2376-6506"}],"articleNumber":"6314200","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":73},"abstract":"In this paper, we consider the generalized beam-forming (GBF) scheme for the MIMO amplify-and-forward relay channel.

However, such systems require the knowledge of the Channel State Information (CSI) at the receiver. In this paper, a new channel estimation approach is proposed using dedicated pilot subcarriers defined at fixed intervals to estimate the channel parameters. Once channel parameters at the pilot subcarriers have been estimated using known pilot symbols at the receiver, the iterative channel estimation process is initiated, and data symbols positioned at adjacent data subcarriers are recovered. Subsequently, the recovered data symbols become the new set of pilots which are then used to re-estimate the channel parameters and recover the next adjacent STBC block. Another major novel contribution of the paper is the proposal of a new group decoding method that reduces the processing time significantly via the use of subcarrier grouping for transmitted data recovery. The OFDM symbols are divided into groups to which a set of pilot subcarriers are assigned and used to initiate the channel estimation process. Designated data symbols contained within each group of the OFDM symbols are decoded simultaneously in order to improve the decoding time duration.","doi":"10.1109/IWCMC.2012.6314202","publicationTitle":"2012 8th International Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing Conference (IWCMC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 8th International Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing Conference (IWCMC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6299140/6314161/06314202.pdf","startPage":"195","endPage":"199","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IWCMC.2012.6314202","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6314161","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An iterative joint channel estimation and data detection technique for MIMO-OFDM systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6314202","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-31 Aug. 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6314202/","displayDocTitle":"An iterative joint channel estimation and data detection technique for MIMO-OFDM systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2012","accessionNumber":"13029596","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6314202/","conferenceDate":"27-31 Aug. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"27 September 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An iterative joint channel estimation and data detection technique for MIMO-OFDM systems","confLoc":"Limassol, Cyprus","sourcePdf":"0354505.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.085162S","chronDate":"27-31 Aug. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6299140","isNumber":"6314161","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6299140","xplore-issue":"6314161","articleId":"6314202","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6314203,"authors":[{"name":"Guanping Lu","affiliation":["Tsinghua National Laboratory for Information Science and Technology (TNList), Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Guanping","lastName":"Lu","id":"37533207700"},{"name":"Jun Wang","affiliation":["Tsinghua National Laboratory for Information Science and Technology (TNList), Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jun","lastName":"Wang","id":"37292907900"},{"name":"Chao Zhang","affiliation":["Tsinghua National Laboratory for Information Science and Technology (TNList), Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Chao","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37274217800"},{"name":"Zhaocheng Wang","affiliation":["Tsinghua National Laboratory for Information Science and Technology (TNList), Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zhaocheng","lastName":"Wang","id":"37404925700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1379-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1378-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-1377-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2376-6492"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2376-6506"}],"articleNumber":"6314203","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":88},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Signal to noise ratio","Estimation","Synchronization","Channel estimation","Detectors","Phase shift keying"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["OFDM modulation","telecommunication channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decision-directed tracking","frequency selective channel","burst mode OFDM transmission","broadband channel","parallel narrowband subchannels","phase error detection method","hard decision working","carrier frequency offset","sampling frequency offset"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["decision directed","synchronization","tracking","CFO","SFO"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents a decision directed frequency and clock tracking scheme to improve the spectrum efficiency of burst mode OFDM transmission with frequency selective channel.

In OFDM system, transmitter can provide high data rates by dividing channels into multiple orthogonal subcarriers and then allocates them to different users. But in the field of multicast, the conventional method ignores the differences of the channel condition between the users and therefore forces the modulation be adjusted to serve the worst user.

In this paper, we propose a dynamic-programming-based algorithm to find the maximum capacity of system in a global manner after partitioning the available power into schedulable equal pieces. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed algorithm, the system throughput gap between the proposed dynamic-programming-based algorithm and the optimal algorithm is within about 2%, and significantly outperform the lowest channel gain method as well as the previous works.","doi":"10.1109/IWCMC.2012.6314204","publicationTitle":"2012 8th International Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing Conference (IWCMC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 8th International Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing Conference (IWCMC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6299140/6314161/06314204.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IWCMC.2012.6314204","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6314161","startPage":"205","endPage":"210","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High efficiency resource allocation in multicast OFDM systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6314204","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"High efficiency resource allocation in multicast OFDM systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-31 Aug. 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6314204/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"27-31 Aug. 2012","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2012","accessionNumber":"13029598","dateOfInsertion":"27 September 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6314204/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High efficiency resource allocation in multicast OFDM systems","confLoc":"Limassol, Cyprus","sourcePdf":"0374149.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053916S","chronDate":"27-31 Aug. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6299140","isNumber":"6314161","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6299140","xplore-issue":"6314161","articleId":"6314204","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6314205,"authors":[{"name":"Wenbo Ding","affiliation":["Electronic Engineering Department, Tsinghua University and Tsinghua National Laboratory for Information Science and Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Wenbo","lastName":"Ding","id":"37889819500"},{"name":"Fang Yang","affiliation":["Electronic Engineering Department, Tsinghua University and Tsinghua National Laboratory for Information Science and Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Fang","lastName":"Yang","id":"37292384500"},{"name":"Jian Song","affiliation":["Electronic Engineering Department, Tsinghua University and Tsinghua National Laboratory for Information Science and Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jian","lastName":"Song","id":"37290858000"},{"name":"Lifeng He","affiliation":["Research Institute of China Mobile, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Lifeng","lastName":"He","id":"37395565000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1379-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1378-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-1377-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2376-6492"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2376-6506"}],"articleNumber":"6314205","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":126},"abstract":"In this paper, a signaling-embedded preamble design is proposed for the orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) system with transmit diversity.

The relative distance between the two TSs in DFT domain could be varied in order to indicate several bits of signaling information for the receiver to acquire the transmission parameters signaling (TPS) quickly. Furthermore, the preamble can also be used for frame synchronization, carrier frequency offset (CFO) estimation, and coarse channel estimation.

The cooperation phase is based on one of two schemes: (1) multiple-access (MA) and (2) single relay selection (RS) transmission. In the MA-BD-AF scheme, all N relay nodes simultaneously transmit linearly coded signals to both source nodes. A simple suboptimal relay selection scheme (i.e. SRS-BD-AF) is proposed such that the relay that maximizes the sum-of-rates is selected to transmit its network coded signal to both source nodes. Finally, a suboptimal sum-of-rates maximizing relay power allocation under the MA-BD-AF scheme is formulated and shown to reduce to the SRS-BD-AF scheme. Also, a symbol error rate performance analysis is provided, where it is shown that the SRS-BD-AF scheme achieves full diversity.

Method I is based on a recursive expansion of the MGF of effective SNR for a 2-hop CAF relay network developed in [10]. The second method is also similar to Method I except that it now requires the exact MGF of the end-to-end SNR for a 2-hop relay network. Method III involves the split of a multi-hop route path into two sections, evaluating the MGF of the \u201cweakest link\u201d in each section, and then finding the MGF of end-to-end SNR using the result in [10] for a 2-hop CAF network. We show that all the above mentioned methods closely approximate the `exact' MGF of end-to-end SNR and the average symbol error rate (ASER) of CAF relay networks. Unlike the existing bounds (which are restrictive to specific fading channels), our proposed solutions is quite general and can be applied to a wide range of fading environments while dramatically reducing the computational complexity of ASER for multi-hop multi-branch CAF relay networks. Moreover, our final solutions for the ASER are expressed in closed-form for first two methods, and in terms of a single integral for Method III. The accuracies of our approximations have been validated with \u201cexact\u201d formulas that are available for specific wireless fading environments and via Monte Carlo computer simulations.","doi":"10.1109/IWCMC.2012.6314209","pdfPath":"/iel5/6299140/6314161/06314209.pdf","startPage":"234","endPage":"239","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 8th International Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing Conference (IWCMC)","publicationTitle":"2012 8th International Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing Conference (IWCMC)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IWCMC.2012.6314209","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6314161","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Asymptotic error rate analysis of multi-hop multi-relay cooperative non-regenerative networks over generalized fading channels","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6314209/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-31 Aug. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Asymptotic error rate analysis of multi-hop multi-relay cooperative non-regenerative networks over generalized fading channels","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"27 September 2012","accessionNumber":"13029603","publicationDate":"Aug. 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6314209/","conferenceDate":"27-31 Aug. 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Asymptotic error rate analysis of multi-hop multi-relay cooperative non-regenerative networks over generalized fading channels","confLoc":"Limassol, Cyprus","sourcePdf":"0427765.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058544S","chronDate":"27-31 Aug. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6299140","isNumber":"6314161","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6299140","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6314161","articleId":"6314209","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6314211,"authors":[{"name":"Ahmed Khattab","affiliation":["The Center for Advanced Computer Studies (CACS), University of Louisiana, Lafayette, USA"],"firstName":"Ahmed","lastName":"Khattab","id":"37284161500"},{"name":"Dmitri Perkins","affiliation":["The Center for Advanced Computer Studies (CACS), University of Louisiana, Lafayette, USA"],"firstName":"Dmitri","lastName":"Perkins","id":"37666904400"},{"name":"Magdy A.

Results show that the DCF/USDMA protocol is able to achieve a significant performance gain compared to that of the conventional DCF, the analysis of which also provides some insights about how the different parameters that control the DCF/USDMA operation can be optimized.","doi":"10.1109/IWCMC.2012.6314214","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IWCMC.2012.6314214","startPage":"263","endPage":"268","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 8th International Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing Conference (IWCMC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6299140/6314161/06314214.pdf","publicationTitle":"2012 8th International Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing Conference (IWCMC)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6314161","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"DCF/USDMA: Enhanced DCF for uplink SDMA transmissions in WLANs","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"27-31 Aug. 2012","displayDocTitle":"DCF/USDMA: Enhanced DCF for uplink SDMA transmissions in WLANs","conferenceDate":"27-31 Aug. 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"27 September 2012","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6314214/","accessionNumber":"13029608","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6314214/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"DCF/USDMA: Enhanced DCF for uplink SDMA transmissions in WLANs","confLoc":"Limassol, Cyprus","sourcePdf":"0477559.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056502S","chronDate":"27-31 Aug. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6299140","isNumber":"6314161","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6299140","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6314161","articleId":"6314214","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6314222,"authors":[{"name":"Wang Hao","affiliation":["Communication Technology Laboratory, Fujitsu Research and Development Company Limited, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Wang","lastName":"Hao","id":"38488533000"},{"name":"Yang Hongwen","affiliation":["School of Information and Communication Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yang","lastName":"Hongwen","id":"37293793600"},{"name":"Tian Jun","affiliation":["Communication Technology Laboratory, Fujitsu Research and Development Company Limited, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Tian","lastName":"Jun","id":"37605140000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1379-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1378-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-1377-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2376-6492"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2376-6506"}],"articleNumber":"6314222","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":138},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Signal to noise ratio","Bit error rate","Loading","Measurement","OFDM","Phase shift keying"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive codes","binary codes","channel coding","modulation coding","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive bit loading algorithm","BICM-OFDM system","coded OFDM system","multilevel subcarrier modulation","multiple binary equivalent channel decomposition","bit-level signal-to-noise ratio","bit-level SNR","symbol-level SNR","bit position","bit allocation","binary channel","bit-interleaved coded modulation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Bit Loading","BICM","OFDM"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we present a bit-loading scheme for coded OFDM systems.

A proof of concept experiment is presented using a link length that varied from 1 m to 4 m with an optical link loss improvement of 53% over an unconditioned beam at the maximum design distance of 4 m. A less than 7% optical link loss is achieved over the whole variable range of the link distance. Applications for the proposed optical link include wireless communication for mobile computing and agile wireless interconnections for server rack wireless.

This parameter may compromise the networks. The selfish misbehaving nodes can seriously affect the network performance. Moreover, the existing mechanisms based on the monitoring process to detect the misbehaving nodes are not efficient and suffer from an important false alarm rate. These weaknesses are mainly due to the interferences and the costs of the monitoring process. In MANET based on SISO (Single-Input Single-Output) technology, the interferences at the monitor node compromise the observation and the accuracy of the cooperation report. That is why in this paper, we focus on the MIMO (Multi-Input and Multi-Output) technology to overcome these drawbacks and to significantly improve the monitoring process. We propose a new MAC protocol called MIMODog-SPACE-MAC based on the well-known SPACE-MAC protocol. It allows the monitor node to avoid the collision during the monitoring process by adjusting the antennas weights in order to nullify the signal coming from other nodes than the monitored one. Therefore, the proposed solution contributes to significantly enhance the accuracy of the monitoring process. We show that for a MIMO network with randomly located nodes n, each equipped with M antennas, the achievable number of monitor nodes is \u0398(M/\u221a(n ln n)). Indeed, theoretical results show that by using MIMODog-SPACE-MAC, the network can have a constant improvement M on an asymptotic number of monitor nodes compared to SISO 802.11 DCF MAC.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MIMODog: How to solve the problem of selfish misbehavior detection mechanism in MANETs using MIMO technology","publicationTitle":"2012 8th International Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing Conference (IWCMC)","doi":"10.1109/IWCMC.2012.6314226","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 8th International Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing Conference (IWCMC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6299140/6314161/06314226.pdf","startPage":"333","endPage":"337","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IWCMC.2012.6314226","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6314161","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6314226","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6314226/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-31 Aug. 2012","displayDocTitle":"MIMODog: How to solve the problem of selfish misbehavior detection mechanism in MANETs using MIMO technology","conferenceDate":"27-31 Aug. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6314226/","dateOfInsertion":"27 September 2012","publicationDate":"Aug. 2012","accessionNumber":"13029618","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MIMODog: How to solve the problem of selfish misbehavior detection mechanism in MANETs using MIMO technology","confLoc":"Limassol, Cyprus","sourcePdf":"0597659.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039917S","chronDate":"27-31 Aug. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6299140","isNumber":"6314161","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6299140","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6314161","articleId":"6314226","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6314227,"authors":[{"name":"Sadia Quadri","affiliation":["Telecommunications Research Laboratory, Toshiba Research Europe Limited, Bristol, UK"],"firstName":"Sadia","lastName":"Quadri","id":"37408869700"},{"name":"Zhong Fan","affiliation":["Telecommunications Research Laboratory, Toshiba Research Europe Limited, Bristol, UK"],"firstName":"Zhong","lastName":"Fan","id":"37273608700"},{"name":"Stephen Lingfeng Wang","affiliation":["Telecommunications Research Laboratory, Toshiba Research Europe Limited, Bristol, UK"],"firstName":"Stephen Lingfeng","lastName":"Wang","id":"38240471400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1379-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1378-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-1377-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2376-6492"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2376-6506"}],"articleNumber":"6314227","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":151},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sensors","Batteries","Switches","Signal to noise ratio","Cognitive radio","Radio spectrum management","Energy efficiency"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","energy conservation","probability","radio spectrum management","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy-efficient spectrum management mechanism","secondary cognitive radio network","secondary node","leader node","primary detection","node coordination","channel scanning","detection probability","fair credit based mechanism","battery consumption","seamless switch","channel migration"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cognitive radio","spectrum management","fairness","energy efficiency"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A fair and energy-efficient spectrum management mechanism for cognitive radio networks","doi":"10.1109/IWCMC.2012.6314227","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6314161","endPage":"343","publicationTitle":"2012 8th International Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing Conference (IWCMC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 8th International Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing Conference (IWCMC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6299140/6314161/06314227.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IWCMC.2012.6314227","startPage":"338","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6314227","abstract":"This paper considers the spectrum management problem in a secondary cognitive radio network where secondary nodes in the network operate on a single channel.

It is shown that if a requesting distribution is undesired, providing more subcarriers will not increase the spectrum availability for the secondary network.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6314231/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-31 Aug. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"27 September 2012","accessionNumber":"13029622","htmlLink":"/document/6314231/","conferenceDate":"27-31 Aug. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Spectrum availability model of secondary users in cognitive radio networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spectrum availability model of secondary users in cognitive radio networks","confLoc":"Limassol, Cyprus","sourcePdf":"0647787.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062918S","chronDate":"27-31 Aug. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6299140","isNumber":"6314161","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6299140","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6314161","articleId":"6314231","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":6314233,"authors":[{"name":"Chaorui Zhang","affiliation":["South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Chaorui","lastName":"Zhang","id":"38194477700"},{"name":"Rong Yu","affiliation":["Guangdong University of Technology, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Rong","lastName":"Yu","id":"37287301800"},{"name":"Yan Zhang","affiliation":["Simula Research Laboratory, University of Oslo, Norway"],"firstName":"Yan","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37405814700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1379-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1378-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-1377-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2376-6492"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2376-6506"}],"articleNumber":"6314233","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":404},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Performance analysis","Sensors","Cognitive radio","Security","Markov processes","Measurement","Analytical models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","Markov processes","telecommunication congestion control","telecommunication security"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio networks","primary user emulation attacks","multi-dimensional Markov model","generic system models","common control channel","call admission control scheme","outage probability"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cognitive Radio","Primary User Emulation Attacks (PUEA)","Security","Common control channel","Call admission control"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6314233","doi":"10.1109/IWCMC.2012.6314233","publicationTitle":"2012 8th International Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing Conference (IWCMC)","abstract":"Cognitive Radio (CR) is a promising technology to efficiently utilize the limited spectrum resources for the rapidly increasing demands on wireless applications and services. Security is very challenging in a CR network due to its unique characteristics, e.g. systems co-existence and interference guarantee. In this paper, we will study the performance of CR networks under Primary User Emulation Attacks (PUEA) that is a typical security issue. A multi-dimensional Markov model is built and the system performance is evaluated under generic system models, including the common control channel (CCC) adoption and a joint PUEA detection and call admission control scheme. We introduce a new performance metric CCC recovery time and redefine outage probability to identify and evaluate the important impact of CCC on the CR network. In addition, we calculate blocking rate, dropping rate, and outage probability of the CR networks. Numerical results show that the system performance may deteriorate severely when attacked. The joint PUEA detection mechanism and guard channel strategy are able to significantly alleviate the performance degradation.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IWCMC.2012.6314233","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6314161","startPage":"371","endPage":"376","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 8th International Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing Conference (IWCMC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6299140/6314161/06314233.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance analysis of Primary User Emulation Attack in Cognitive Radio networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6314233/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-31 Aug. 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6314233/","displayDocTitle":"Performance analysis of Primary User Emulation Attack in Cognitive Radio networks","conferenceDate":"27-31 Aug. 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2012","accessionNumber":"13029624","dateOfInsertion":"27 September 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance analysis of Primary User Emulation Attack in Cognitive Radio networks","confLoc":"Limassol, Cyprus","sourcePdf":"0663645.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052257S","chronDate":"27-31 Aug. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6299140","isNumber":"6314161","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6299140","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"6314161","articleId":"6314233","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6314235,"authors":[{"name":"Mohammed AL-Imari","affiliation":["Centre for Communication Systems Research, University of Surrey, Guildford, Surrey, UK"],"firstName":"Mohammed","lastName":"AL-Imari","id":"38274981200"},{"name":"Muhammad Ali Imran","affiliation":["Centre for Communication Systems Research, University of Surrey, Guildford, Surrey, UK"],"firstName":"Muhammad Ali","lastName":"Imran","id":"37265529100"},{"name":"Rahim Tafazolli","affiliation":["Centre for Communication Systems Research, University of Surrey, Guildford, Surrey, UK"],"firstName":"Rahim","lastName":"Tafazolli","id":"37280285600"},{"name":"Dageng Chen","affiliation":["Huawei Technologies Company, Limited, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Dageng","lastName":"Chen","id":"37671147600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1379-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1378-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-1377-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2376-6492"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2376-6506"}],"articleNumber":"6314235","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":16,"citationCountPatent":7,"totalDownloads":471},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resource management","Gain","Base stations","Phase shift keying","Complexity theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","error statistics","next generation networks","spectral analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multicarrier low density spreading multiple access","MC-LDSMA","multiple access technique","mobile communication system","cubic metric","block error rate","spectral efficiency","fairness","next generation cellular system","system level performance evaluation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Multiple access technique","low density spreading","cubic metric","link-level","spectral efficiency","fairness"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we evaluate the performance of Multicarrier-Low Density Spreading Multiple Access (MC-LDSMA) as a multiple access technique for mobile communication systems.

In this paper, noise uncertainty which has a great impact on sensing methods is taken into account in the maximization of throughput using eigenvalue based spectrum sensing schemes. This issue has not been tackled in the throughput associated studies before. First, the theoretical and empirical distributions of the decision statistics and the detection performances for eigenvalue based sensing techniques are studied in the presence of noise uncertainty. The computed detection probabilities of maximum-minimum eigenvalue (MME) detector and maximum eigenvalue detector (MED) are compared with the most widely used energy detector (ED). Then, in the light of the obtained results, the throughput of the secondary network is maximized in order to find out the sensing duration for each scheme using multiple receive antennas. It is shown that, under low signal to noise ratio (SNR) regime, the designed sensing slot duration achieves the best sensing throughput tradeoff.","doi":"10.1109/IWCMC.2012.6314237","publicationTitle":"2012 8th International Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing Conference (IWCMC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 8th International Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing Conference (IWCMC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6299140/6314161/06314237.pdf","startPage":"395","endPage":"400","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IWCMC.2012.6314237","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6314161","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Throughput analysis using eigenvalue based spectrum sensing under noise uncertainty","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6314237","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-31 Aug. 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6314237/","displayDocTitle":"Throughput analysis using eigenvalue based spectrum sensing under noise uncertainty","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2012","accessionNumber":"13029628","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6314237/","conferenceDate":"27-31 Aug. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"27 September 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Throughput analysis using eigenvalue based spectrum sensing under noise uncertainty","confLoc":"Limassol, Cyprus","sourcePdf":"0705227.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060018S","chronDate":"27-31 Aug. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6299140","isNumber":"6314161","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6299140","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6314161","articleId":"6314237","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6314241,"authors":[{"name":"Leila Musavian","affiliation":["McGill University, Montreal, QUE, Canada"],"firstName":"Leila","lastName":"Musavian","id":"37284625400"},{"name":"Tho Le-Ngoc","affiliation":["McGill University, Montreal, QUE, Canada"],"firstName":"Tho","lastName":"Le-Ngoc","id":"37271236200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1379-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1378-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-1377-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2376-6492"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2376-6506"}],"articleNumber":"6314241","dbTime":"18 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":248},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6314241","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Delay","Fading","Automatic repeat request","Resource management","Quality of service","Transmitters","Receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive codes","adaptive modulation","automatic repeat request","cognitive radio","error statistics","Nakagami channels","quality of service","resource allocation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cross layer design","cognitive radio","adaptive modulation and coding","AMC","automatic repeat request","ARQ","quality-of-service","delay QoS constraint","packet error rate","spectrum sharing channel","cross-layer resource allocation","secondary user","primary user receiver","physical layer","statistical delay constraints","Nakagami-m fading channels"]}],"doi":"10.1109/IWCMC.2012.6314241","publicationTitle":"2012 8th International Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing Conference (IWCMC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 8th International Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing Conference (IWCMC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6299140/6314161/06314241.pdf","startPage":"419","endPage":"424","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IWCMC.2012.6314241","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6314161","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cross-layer design for cognitive radios with joint AMC and ARQ under delay QoS constraint","abstract":"In order to guarantee dual quality-of-service (QoS) measures, namely, packet error rate (PER) and delay constraint, in a spectrum-sharing channel, we propose a cross-layer resource allocation approach in this paper.

The SU employs adaptive modulation and coding (AMC) at the physical layer and automatic repeat request (ARQ) at the link-layer.

The transmitted bits per symbol period are divided into two blocks: the first block contains the antenna beam patterns and the second APM symbols. Then, the second block is mapped to an APM symbol, which is transmitted by the antenna pattern selected by the first block. The beam pattern and the transmitted symbol are detected using the maximum likelihood (ML) by the receiver, in order to de-map the block of information bits. The bit error rate (BER) performance of the proposed ABPM is evaluated over independent and identically distributed (iid) Rayleigh fading channel. The simulation results show that with appropriately designed beam patterns, the transmission scheme can provide a better performance and enhanced throughput when compared to conventional spatial modulation (SM) and APM.","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 8th International Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing Conference (IWCMC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6299140/6314161/06314270.pdf","startPage":"591","endPage":"595","publicationTitle":"2012 8th International Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing Conference (IWCMC)","doi":"10.1109/IWCMC.2012.6314270","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IWCMC.2012.6314270","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6314161","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6314270","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Antenna beam pattern modulation for MIMO channels","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Transmitting antennas","Vectors","MIMO","Bit error rate","Phase shift keying"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplitude modulation","antenna radiation patterns","error statistics","maximum likelihood detection","MIMO communication","phase modulation","radio receivers","Rayleigh channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna beam pattern modulation","MIMO channels","transmission scheme","amplitude/phase modulation","maximum likelihood","bit error rate","BER","Rayleigh fading channel"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6314270/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-31 Aug. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Antenna beam pattern modulation for MIMO channels","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6314270/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2012","accessionNumber":"13029661","dateOfInsertion":"27 September 2012","conferenceDate":"27-31 Aug. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Antenna beam pattern modulation for MIMO channels","confLoc":"Limassol, Cyprus","sourcePdf":"1037719.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.0765S","chronDate":"27-31 Aug. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6299140","isNumber":"6314161","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6299140","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6314161","articleId":"6314270","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6314271,"authors":[{"name":"Yi Wan","affiliation":["Institute for Signals and Information Processing, Lanzhou University, China"],"firstName":"Yi","lastName":"Wan","id":"37292530200"},{"name":"Zhongping Chen","affiliation":["Institute for Signals and Information Processing, Lanzhou University, China"],"firstName":"Zhongping","lastName":"Chen","id":"38488520000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1379-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1378-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-1377-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2376-6492"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2376-6506"}],"articleNumber":"6314271","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":166},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Synchronization","Interference","Decoding","Field programmable gate arrays","Multiaccess communication","Bit error rate","Receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analogue-digital conversion","channel bank filters","code division multiple access","decoding","digital filters","field programmable gate arrays","interference (signal)","spread spectrum communication","synchronisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["synchronization method","DS-CDMA systems","code division multiple access","spread-spectrum multiple access technique","anti-interference capability","implementation versatility","receiver side synchronization","sub-chip scale","decoding error rate","carrier frequency offset","OFDM systems","faster sampling clock","receiver analog-to-digital converter","receiving performance","STEL-2000A CDMA chip","interchip interference","error floor","sampling rate","digital filter bank","synchronization solution","clock disparity","field programmable gate array","chip-level implementation"]}],"abstract":"Code division multiple access (CDMA) has been proven to be a promising spread-spectrum multiple access technique due to its advantages such as anti-interference capability and implementation versatility. However, the problem of the receiver side synchronization at the sub-chip scale can significantly increase the decoding error rate, just as the carrier frequency offset (CFO) problem does to the OFDM systems. So far the use of faster sampling clock at the receiver analog-to-digital converter (ADC) is generally thought to improve the receiving performance and has been implemented in practical communication hardware such as the STEL-2000A CDMA chip. In this paper we show that the traditional use of such scheme can introduce interchip interference that causes an error floor irrespective of the sampling rate. We further propose a novel synchronization method that uses a digital filter bank to automatically seek out the best synchronization solution. Simulation results show that the proposed method performs almost as good as the case of perfect synchronization and far better than when there is a clock disparity. The proposed algorithm is also implemented in field programmable gate array (FPGA) and compared with the traditional approach to pave the way for its practical chip-level implementation.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel synchronization method for DS-CDMA systems","publicationTitle":"2012 8th International Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing Conference (IWCMC)","doi":"10.1109/IWCMC.2012.6314271","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 8th International Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing Conference (IWCMC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6299140/6314161/06314271.pdf","startPage":"596","endPage":"601","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IWCMC.2012.6314271","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6314161","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6314271","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6314271/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-31 Aug. 2012","displayDocTitle":"A novel synchronization method for DS-CDMA systems","conferenceDate":"27-31 Aug. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6314271/","dateOfInsertion":"27 September 2012","publicationDate":"Aug. 2012","accessionNumber":"13029662","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel synchronization method for DS-CDMA systems","confLoc":"Limassol, Cyprus","sourcePdf":"1047295.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064336S","chronDate":"27-31 Aug. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6299140","isNumber":"6314161","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6299140","xplore-issue":"6314161","articleId":"6314271","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":6314279,"authors":[{"name":"Po-Kai Tseng","affiliation":["Research Center for Information Technology Innovation, Academia Sinica, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Po-Kai","lastName":"Tseng","id":"37397914300"},{"name":"Huan Chen","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, National Chung Hsing University, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Huan","lastName":"Chen","id":"37407258100"},{"name":"Wei-Ho Chung","affiliation":["Research Center for Information Technology Innovation, Academia Sinica, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Wei-Ho","lastName":"Chung","id":"37538749800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1379-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1378-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-1377-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2376-6492"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2376-6506"}],"articleNumber":"6314279","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":156},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6314279","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Throughput","Cognitive radio","Equations","Energy efficiency","Power control","Energy consumption","Mathematical model"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel allocation","cognitive radio","computational complexity","heuristic programming","integer programming","nonlinear programming","power control","radio networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy efficiency","noninfrastructure based cognitive radio networks","mixed integer nonlinear programming problem","MINP problem","power control","channel assignment","energy consumption","network throughput","NP-hard property","Lagrangian relaxation based heuristic","LRH"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cognitive Radio Networks","Energy Efficiency","Throughput","Optimization"]}],"doi":"10.1109/IWCMC.2012.6314279","publicationTitle":"2012 8th International Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing Conference (IWCMC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 8th International Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing Conference (IWCMC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6299140/6314161/06314279.pdf","startPage":"642","endPage":"647","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IWCMC.2012.6314279","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6314161","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint design on energy efficiency and throughput for non-infrastructure based cognitive radio networks","abstract":"In this paper, two critical issues, i.e., energy efficiency and throughput, are jointly considered for non-infrastructure based cognitive radio networks.

In this paper, we consider the indoor coverage and load balance problem of femto base stations in order to provide better quality of service. By exploiting the Voronoi diagram, we can achieve maximal indoor coverage with minimized maximum required transmit power, which results in reduced interference. Our algorithm can adopt any radio propagation model to achieve more accurate coverage for an indoor environment with various obstacles. Time varying data traffic may cause unbalanced data load of base stations producing traffic overload. Our dynamic power control algorithm redistributes the data load by automatically adjusting transmit power levels according to data traffic estimation while preserving coverage.

Simulation results show that the proposed scheme outperformed two representative algorithms used for comparison.","doi":"10.1109/IWCMC.2012.6314311","publicationTitle":"2012 8th International Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing Conference (IWCMC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 8th International Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing Conference (IWCMC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6299140/6314161/06314311.pdf","startPage":"827","endPage":"832","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IWCMC.2012.6314311","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6314161","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimized frequency allocation for interference mitigation in femtocellular networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6314311","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-31 Aug. 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6314311/","displayDocTitle":"Optimized frequency allocation for interference mitigation in femtocellular networks","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2012","accessionNumber":"13029700","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6314311/","conferenceDate":"27-31 Aug. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"27 September 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimized frequency allocation for interference mitigation in femtocellular networks","confLoc":"Limassol, Cyprus","sourcePdf":"1436175.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.099956S","chronDate":"27-31 Aug. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6299140","isNumber":"6314161","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6299140","xplore-issue":"6314161","articleId":"6314311","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6314324,"authors":[{"name":"Dimitris E.

To this end; we approximate the PDF of the MAI by the Laplacian, Generalized Gaussian and the Symmetric \u03b1-Stable distributions. It has been shown that a Gaussian PDF is not a good approximation even when there are a moderately large number of interferers in the UWB system and the Generalized Gaussian distribution gives a much better approximation than both the Laplacian and Gaussian distributions. In this paper, it has been observed that the symmetric \u03b1-stable distribution gives the best approximation to the PDF of the MAI. The bit error rate (BER) performance of the time hopping UWB communication systems in the presence of MAI using these non-Gaussian modeling approaches is numerically investigated, validated with simulation results, and compared with the common Gaussian approximation.","doi":"10.1109/IWCMC.2012.6314327","publicationTitle":"2012 8th International Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing

In this paper, we present an analytic study of the uplink (UL) physical interference and other related metrics, namely the signal to interference ratio (SIR) and the outage probability in FCs. We consider a stochastic model in which the spatial distribution of the femto users (FUs) and the macro users (MUs) is described by two independent, homogeneous Poisson Point Processes (PPPs). We first characterize the UL interference at the FC by deriving its first and second order statistics, its probability density function (PDF) and its tail distribution. Second, we derive the PDF of the per-FU SIR, its temporal autocorrelation and the outage probability. Finally, we validate the derived outage probability via Monte-Carlo simulations and show how this probability constrains the system capacity in terms of number (or density) of FUs that could be accepted in the MC.","doi":"10.1109/IWCMC.2012.6314336","publicationTitle":"2012 8th International Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing Conference (IWCMC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 8th International Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing Conference (IWCMC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6299140/6314161/06314336.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IWCMC.2012.6314336","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6314161","startPage":"968","endPage":"973","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Statistical characterization of uplink interference in two-tier co-channel femtocell networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6314336","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Statistical characterization of uplink interference in two-tier co-channel femtocell networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-31 Aug. 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6314336/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"27-31 Aug. 2012","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2012","accessionNumber":"13029725","dateOfInsertion":"27 September 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6314336/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Statistical characterization of uplink interference in two-tier co-channel femtocell networks","confLoc":"Limassol, Cyprus","sourcePdf":"1684527.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.100938S","chronDate":"27-31 Aug. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6299140","isNumber":"6314161","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6299140","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6314161","articleId":"6314336","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6314359,"authors":[{"name":"R.

Vehicle-to-vehicle message exchange is considered the preferred pattern for safety-critical communication (e.g. in anti-collision active systems). Recently, LED-based optical wireless communication has been also proposed for car to car message delivery. This option turns to be particularly effective in short range direct communications to exploit its line-of-sight feature and overcome the issues related to the isotropic nature of radio waves. In this paper we experimentally address this case study making use of two low cost On-Board Unit prototypes, equipped with a common Light Emitting Diode (LED) component at the transmitter and a common PIN photodiode at the receiver.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"27-31 Aug. 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6314359/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6314359/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"13029748","conferenceDate":"27-31 Aug. 2012","publicationDate":"Aug. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"27 September 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Free space optical communication in the visible bandwidth for V2V safety critical protocols","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Free space optical communication in the visible bandwidth for V2V safety critical protocols","confLoc":"Limassol, Cyprus","sourcePdf":"1916751.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.09255S","chronDate":"27-31 Aug. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6299140","isNumber":"6314161","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6299140","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"6314161","articleId":"6314359","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6314361,"authors":[{"name":"Chen Wang","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Rail Traffic Control and Safety, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Chen","lastName":"Wang","id":"38488598000"},{"name":"Rongtao Xu","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Rail Traffic Control and Safety, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Rongtao","lastName":"Xu","id":"37587351300"},{"name":"Jia You","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Rail Traffic Control and Safety, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jia","lastName":"You","id":"38488629100"},{"name":"Zhangdui Zhong","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Rail Traffic Control and Safety, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zhangdui","lastName":"Zhong","id":"37287974400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1379-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1378-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-1377-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2376-6492"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2376-6506"}],"articleNumber":"6314361","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":355},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["US Department of Defense","Array signal processing","Receiving antennas","Signal to noise ratio","Transmitting antennas","Estimation error"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","diversity reception","estimation theory","radio transmitters","railway communication","telecommunication network topology","transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high speed railway","location assistant direction of departure-based beamforming scheme","location assistant DOD-based beamforming scheme","wireless communication","HSR","beamforming weights","mobile station locations","base station","multiple transmitting antennas","transmitter phase adjustment","signal-to-noise ratio","location errors","transmission modes","transmitting diversity","single-input single-output","SISO","inevitable DOD estimation error"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Beamforming","direction of departure","location","high-speed railway"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Location assistant beamforming for high speed railway","doi":"10.1109/IWCMC.2012.6314361","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6314161","endPage":"1112","publicationTitle":"2012 8th International Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing Conference (IWCMC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 8th International Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing Conference (IWCMC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6299140/6314161/06314361.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IWCMC.2012.6314361","startPage":"1108","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6314361","abstract":"In this paper, we introduce an algorithm of location assistant direction of departure (DOD) based beamforming scheme which is suitable for wireless communication in highspeed railway (HSR). The beamforming weights are calculated according to the locations of mobile station (MS) and base station (BS) together with the topology of multiple transmit antennas. The purpose of the algorithm is to make phase adjustment at the transmitter such that the output signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at the receiver can be improved. The performance of beamforming with ideal DOD and estimated DOD which has deviation caused by location errors are both evaluated. Results show that beamforming with ideal DOD greatly outperforms all other transmission modes, i.e., transmit diversity and single-input single-output (SISO), while the inevitable DOD estimation error degrades the overall performance.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6314361/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-31 Aug. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"27 September 2012","accessionNumber":"13029750","htmlLink":"/document/6314361/","conferenceDate":"27-31 Aug. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Location assistant beamforming for high speed railway","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Location assistant beamforming for high speed railway","confLoc":"Limassol, Cyprus","sourcePdf":"1937617.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.082879S","chronDate":"27-31 Aug. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6299140","isNumber":"6314161","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6299140","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6314161","articleId":"6314361","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6314371,"authors":[{"name":"Jose-Maria Molina-Garcia-Pardo","affiliation":["Information Technologies and Communications, Technical University of Cartagena, Cartagena, Spain"],"firstName":"Jose-Maria","lastName":"Molina-Garcia-Pardo","id":"37267388300"},{"name":"Martine Li\u00e9nard","affiliation":["IEMN/TELICE, University of Lille (USTL), Villeneuve d'Ascq, France"],"firstName":"Martine","lastName":"Li\u00e9nard","id":"37277919400"},{"name":"Pierre Degauque","affiliation":["IEMN/TELICE, University of Lille (USTL), Villeneuve d'Ascq, France"],"firstName":"Pierre","lastName":"Degauque","id":"37277935200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1379-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1378-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-1377-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2376-6492"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2376-6506"}],"articleNumber":"6314371","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":169},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Correlation","MIMO","Antennas","Arrays","Attenuation","Roads"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","channel capacity","correlation theory","diversity reception","electromagnetic wave propagation","MIMO communication","modal analysis","tunnels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["modal theory","path loss","MIMO capacity","tunnel","multiple input multiple output","base station","diversity reception","electromagnetic wave propagation","correlation method","antenna array"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MIMO","modal theory","tunnel","correlation","path loss","propagation"]}],"abstract":"Theoretical and experimental approaches of the propagation in tunnels have been widely described in the literature, mainly focusing on the possibility of using multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) transmission schemes, despite the small angular spread both at the transmitting and at the receiving site. Nevertheless, all these studies assume that the fixed base station is situated inside the tunnel. The objective of this paper is to generalize this case by considering the excitation of a tunnel by an outside antenna in order to know if, inside the tunnel, the diversity remains rich enough to get profit from MIMO techniques. The modal theory of the electromagnetic wave propagation will be used for interpreting the variation of path loss, correlation between array elements and capacity, as a function of the offset angle characterizing the direction of the fixed antenna array referred to the tunnel axis.","doi":"10.1109/IWCMC.2012.6314371","publicationTitle":"2012 8th International Wireless Communications and Mobile

In this paper, we discuss the bit mapping optimization performed by employing an additional DEMUX following the given bit interleaver, and then apply it to the second generation digital video broadcasting system for cable (DVB-C2). The extrinsic information transfer (EXIT) chart technique is adopted to analyze the influence of bit mapping on the iterative decoding process. Based on the EXIT-chart analysis, an optimization method is proposed to design the DEMUX for performance improvement. As an example, we re-design the DEMUX for the DVB-C2 system with reduced DEMUX width. The superior performance of the optimized DEMUX is verified by the bit error rate (BER) simulation.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"27-31 Aug. 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6314373/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6314373/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"13029761","conferenceDate":"27-31 Aug. 2012","publicationDate":"Aug. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"27 September 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"An EXIT-chart aided optimization of bit mapping for DVB-C2 system","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An EXIT-chart aided optimization of bit mapping for DVB-C2 system","confLoc":"Limassol, Cyprus","sourcePdf":"2054217.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04278S","chronDate":"27-31 Aug. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6299140","isNumber":"6314161","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6299140","xplore-issue":"6314161","articleId":"6314373","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6314375,"authors":[{"name":"Ronald Y.

Different users in the cell are categorized into three classes based on their radio channel's conditions. We develop two different admission control policy: an opportunistic approach allowing to serve initially users having the best radio channel conditions and a democratic like admission control policy which represents proportionally the three users' classes like an electoral system.

Numerical results will show the performance of the method.","doi":"10.1109/IWCMC.2012.6314377","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 8th International Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing Conference (IWCMC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6299140/6314161/06314377.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6314161","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IWCMC.2012.6314377","publicationTitle":"2012 8th International Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing Conference (IWCMC)","startPage":"1197","endPage":"1202","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Open spectrum communication systems and optimized downlink beamforming","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6314377","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-31 Aug. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Open spectrum communication systems and optimized downlink beamforming","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6314377/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6314377/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2012","accessionNumber":"13029765","dateOfInsertion":"27 September 2012","conferenceDate":"27-31 Aug. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Open spectrum communication systems and optimized downlink beamforming","confLoc":"Limassol, Cyprus","sourcePdf":"2096511.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067683S","chronDate":"27-31 Aug. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6299140","isNumber":"6314161","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6299140","xplore-issue":"6314161","articleId":"6314377","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6314380,"authors":[{"name":"Jinlin Peng","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University of Leeds, Leeds, UK"],"firstName":"Jinlin","lastName":"Peng","id":"37599469100"},{"name":"Pengfei Sun","affiliation":["Renesas Mobile Europe, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Pengfei","lastName":"Sun","id":"37396760300"},{"name":"Li Zhang","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University of Leeds, Leeds, UK"],"firstName":"Li","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37280172300"},{"name":"Keshav Kuber","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University of Leeds, Leeds, UK"],"firstName":"Keshav","lastName":"Kuber","id":"38488764200"},{"name":"Des McLernon","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University of Leeds, Leeds, UK"],"firstName":"Des","lastName":"McLernon","id":"37285107700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1379-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1378-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-1377-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2376-6492"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2376-6506"}],"articleNumber":"6314380","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":247},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Femtocells","Synchronization","Interference","Training","Mobile communication","OFDM"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","cochannel interference","correlation theory","femtocellular radio","frequency allocation","frequency division multiple access","indoor radio","interference suppression","OFDM modulation","synchronisation","timing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["OFDMA femtocell","cochannel interference","indoor coverage","cellular system","spectrum reuse","base station","frequency resource reuse","CCI","timing synchronization problem","macrocell uplink","cross correlation method","prefilter","CCI effect mitigation"]}],"abstract":"The Femtocell is an attractive solution to improve the indoor coverage of cellular systems. By applying spectrum reuse, femtocells can improve the efficiency of spectrum usage. However, since femtocells are deployed by end-users, insufficient coordination between base stations leads to the reuse of the same frequency resources and results in CCI (co-channel interference), which seriously complicates the synchronization problem, particularly in OFDM based systems, such as WiMAX and LTE. In this paper, we investigate the timing synchronization problem in the presence of CCI of an OFDMA macro/femto uplink scenario. We consider the cross-correlation based timing synchronization and propose a pre-filter to mitigate the CCI effect. The simulation results show that this method effectively eliminates the effect of CCI on the cross-correlation based timing synchronization and provides a performance close to that of no CCI case.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Timing synchronization for OFDMA femtocells in the presence of co-channel interference","publicationTitle":"2012 8th International Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing Conference (IWCMC)","doi":"10.1109/IWCMC.2012.6314380","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 8th International Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing Conference (IWCMC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6299140/6314161/06314380.pdf","startPage":"1215","endPage":"1220","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IWCMC.2012.6314380","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6314161","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6314380","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6314380/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-31 Aug. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Timing synchronization for OFDMA femtocells in the presence of co-channel interference","conferenceDate":"27-31 Aug. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6314380/","dateOfInsertion":"27 September 2012","publicationDate":"Aug. 2012","accessionNumber":"13029768","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Timing synchronization for OFDMA femtocells in the presence of co-channel interference","confLoc":"Limassol, Cyprus","sourcePdf":"2127485.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058029S","chronDate":"27-31 Aug. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6299140","isNumber":"6314161","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6299140","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6314161","articleId":"6314380","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6314382,"authors":[{"name":"Debalina Ghosh","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of California,\uc2a0Davis, Davis, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Debalina","lastName":"Ghosh","id":"37671819400"},{"name":"Prasant Mohapatra","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of California,\uc2a0Davis, Davis, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Prasant","lastName":"Mohapatra","id":"37283726400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1379-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1378-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-1377-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2376-6492"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2376-6506"}],"articleNumber":"6314382","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":83},"abstract":"Adaptive modulation and coding is an important characteristic of OFDMA based wireless networks. A group of subcarriers and symbols (which we refer to as \u201callocation unit\u201d) can be assigned to an user equipment (UE) based on its channel conditions. The \u201callocation units\u201d can have different bandwidths for different UEs depending on the current channel conditions of the UEs. The UEs typically have a minimum throughput requirement. In this article our goal is to design a scheduler that maximizes the number of scheduled UEs while meeting their minimum throughput requirements. First we define an analytical model for scheduling and then propose three algorithms for the optimization problem. We show that, given the sets of \u201callocation units\u201d, maximizing the number of UEs is equivalent to finding the maximum independent set of a bounded degree graph. We also define the set allocation problem that minimizes the number of intersecting sets subject to certain constraints.","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 8th International Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing Conference (IWCMC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6299140/6314161/06314382.pdf","startPage":"1227","endPage":"1232","publicationTitle":"2012 8th International Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing Conference (IWCMC)","doi":"10.1109/IWCMC.2012.6314382","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IWCMC.2012.6314382","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6314161","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6314382","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Throughput-constrained scheduling in OFDMA wireless networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resource management","Throughput","Gold","Bandwidth","Approximation algorithms","Antennas","MIMO"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive codes","adaptive modulation","frequency division multiple access","graph theory","OFDM modulation","optimisation","telecommunication network reliability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["throughput-constrained scheduling","OFDMA wireless networks","adaptive modulation","adaptive coding","user equipment","allocation unit","UE","channel conditions","optimization problem","maximum independent set","bounded degree graph","set allocation problem"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["independent set","allocation unit","throughput","scheduling"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6314382/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-31 Aug. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Throughput-constrained scheduling in OFDMA wireless networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6314382/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2012","accessionNumber":"13029770","dateOfInsertion":"27 September 2012","conferenceDate":"27-31 Aug. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Throughput-constrained scheduling in OFDMA wireless networks","confLoc":"Limassol, Cyprus","sourcePdf":"2143315.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075054S","chronDate":"27-31 Aug. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6299140","isNumber":"6314161","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6299140","xplore-issue":"6314161","articleId":"6314382","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6314391,"authors":[{"name":"Sun Jinhua","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Integrated Service Networks, Xidian University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Sun","lastName":"Jinhua","id":"38363615800"},{"name":"Zhu Jili","affiliation":["Science and Technology on Information Transmission and Dissemination in Communication Networks Laboratory, The 54th research Institute of CETC, Shijiazhuang, China"],"firstName":"Zhu","lastName":"Jili","id":"38488626300"},{"name":"Wu Xiaojun","affiliation":["School of Information Engineering, Changan University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Wu","lastName":"Xiaojun","id":"37085191700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1305-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1302-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-1304-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6314391","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":162},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Estimation","Synchronization","Frequency estimation","Bit error rate","Partial transmit sequences","Algorithm design and analysis","Optimized production technology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["coherence","communication complexity","demodulation","error statistics","mean square error methods","quadrature phase shift keying","synchronisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["SOQPSK signal","carrier recovery problem","frequency offset","short burst communication system","shaped-offset quadrature phase shift keying","demodulation soft information carrier synchronization algorithm","coarse estimation region","carrier synchronization parameter","maximum-mean-square soft output","computation complexity","BER performance","optimal coherent demodulation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["SOQPSK","pilot","soft information","synchronization"]}],"abstract":"To solve the carrier recovery problem with large frequency offset in short burst communication systems using shaped-offset quadrature phase shift keying(SOQPSK), a joint pilot and demodulation soft information carrier synchronization algorithm is proposed.

Results of simulation for a 10-element uniform linear array verify the availability and effectiveness of this robust method.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 May 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6314412/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"13035316","publicationDate":"May 2012","conferenceDate":"27-30 May 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6314412/","dateOfInsertion":"27 September 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Robust near-field beamforming with worst case performance based on convex optimization","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust near-field beamforming with worst case performance based on convex optimization","confLoc":"Harbin, China","sourcePdf":"241264.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.0513S","chronDate":"27-30 May 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6302082","isNumber":"6313975","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6302082","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6313975","articleId":"6314412","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6314466,"authors":[{"name":"Gerhard Wunder","affiliation":["Alcatel-Lucent, Bell Laboratories, Crawford Hills, NJ, USA","Heinrich Hertz Institute, Berlin, Germany"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/6361508/6314466/6314466-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Gerhard Wunder (M'05) studied electrical engineering at the University of Hannover, Germany, and the Technische Universit\u00e4t (TU) Berlin, Germany, and received his graduate degree in electrical engineering (Dipl.-Ing.) with highest honors in 1999 and the PhD degree (Dr.-Ing.) in communication engineering on the peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) problem in OFDM with distinction (summa cum laude) in 2003 from TU Berlin.

RA combines the flexibility and robustness needed for reliable communications with the user terminal under a limited feedback constraint. It responds to two important observations. First, it is not so significant to approximate the channel but rather the rate, such that the optimal scheduling decision can be mimicked at the base station. Second, a fixed transmit codebook at the transmitter is often better when therefore the channel state information is more accurate. In the RA scheme the transmit and feedback codebook are separated and user rates are delivered to the base station subject to a controlled uniform error. The scheme is analyzed and proved to have better performance below a certain interference plus noise margin and better behavior than the classical Jindal formula. LTE system simulations sustain the analytic results showing performance gains of up to 50% or 70% compared to zeroforcing when using multiple antennas at the base station and multiple antennas or a single antenna at the terminals, respectively. A new feedback protocol is developed which inherently considers the transmit codebook and which is able to deal with the complexity issue at the terminal.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/6361508/06314466.pdf","startPage":"3921","endPage":"3931","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2012.091812.111453","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2012.091812.111453","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6361508","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6314466","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Nearly Doubling the Throughput of Multiuser MIMO Systems Using Codebook Tailored Limited Feedback Protocol","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Base stations","Vectors","Array signal processing","Standards","Signal to noise ratio","MIMO","Approximation methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","approximation theory","Long Term Evolution","MIMO communication","multiuser channels","protocols","radio transmitters","scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["codebook tailored limited feedback protocol","transmit strategy","robust feedback strategy","multiuser MIMO downlink communication systems","rate approximation","optimal scheduling decision","channel state information","RA scheme","LTE system simulations","classical Jindal formula","interference plus noise margin","zeroforcing","multiple antennas","transmitter","base station"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["LTE","multiuser MIMO","limited feedback","robustness","RVQ","covering","simplex","codebook optimization"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6314466/","chronOrPublicationDate":"November  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 September 2012","displayDocTitle":"Nearly Doubling the Throughput of Multiuser MIMO Systems Using Codebook Tailored Limited Feedback Protocol","volume":"11","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/6314466/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"November 2012","accessionNumber":"13148959","dateOfInsertion":"26 November 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Nearly Doubling the Throughput of Multiuser MIMO Systems Using Codebook Tailored Limited Feedback Protocol","sourcePdf":"3921-tw1211-wunder.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.080273S","chronDate":"November  2012","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6361508","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"6361508","articleId":"6314466","onlineDate":"27 September 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6314467,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaojun Feng","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/6361508/6314467/6314467-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Xiaojun Feng (S'09) is currently a Ph.D. candidate in Hong Kong University of Science and Technology.

Most of prior works have assumed that all spectrums are identical. In reality, however, spectrums provided by different owners have distinctive characteristics in both spacial and frequency domains. Spectrum availability also varies in different geo-locations. Furthermore, frequency diversity may cause non-identical conflict relationships among spectrum buyers since different frequencies have distinct communication ranges. Under such a scenario, existing spectrum auction schemes cannot provide truthfulness or efficiency. In this paper, we propose a Truthful double Auction mechanism for HEterogeneous Spectrum, called TAHES, which allows buyers to explicitly express their personalized preferences for heterogeneous spectrums and also addresses the problem of interference graph variation. We prove that TAHES has nice economic properties including truthfulness, individual rationality and budget balance. Results from extensive simulation studies demonstrate the truthfulness, effectiveness and efficiency of TAHES.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/6361508/06314467.pdf","startPage":"4038","endPage":"4047","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2012.091812.112193","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2012.091812.112193","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6361508","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6314467","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"TAHES: A Truthful Double Auction Mechanism for Heterogeneous Spectrums","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference","Cost accounting","Wireless communication","Availability","Vectors","Pricing","White spaces"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["diversity reception","frequency-domain analysis","graph theory","radio spectrum management","radiofrequency interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["TAHES","wireless communication","spectrum allocation","frequency-domain analysis","spectrum availability","frequency diversity","spectrum auction schemes","truthful double auction mechanism for heterogeneous spectrum","interference graph variation problem","economic properties","budget balance"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Spectrum auction","double auction","TV white space","truthfulness"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6314467/","chronOrPublicationDate":"November  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 September 2012","displayDocTitle":"TAHES: A Truthful Double Auction Mechanism for Heterogeneous Spectrums","volume":"11","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/6314467/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"November 2012","accessionNumber":"13148960","dateOfInsertion":"26 November 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"TAHES: A Truthful Double Auction Mechanism for Heterogeneous Spectrums","sourcePdf":"4038-tw1211-feng.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.063094S","chronDate":"November  2012","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6361508","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"70","xplore-issue":"6361508","articleId":"6314467","onlineDate":"27 September 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6314471,"authors":[{"name":"Haris I.

The training speed and expected performance during this task are of paramount importance to the system's operation, especially when the system is facing new conditions. In this paper, we provide a thorough examination of cognitive engine training, and we analytically estimate the number of trials needed to conclusively find the best-performing communication method in a list of methods sorted by their possible throughput. We show that, even if only a fraction of the methods meet the minimum packet success rate requirement, near maximal performance can be reached quickly. Furthermore, we propose the Robust Training Algorithm (RoTA) for applications in which stable performance during training is of utmost importance. We show that the RoTA can facilitate training while maintaining a minimum performance level, albeit at the expense of training speed. Finally, we test four key training techniques (\u03b5-greedy; Boltzmann exploration; the Gittins index strategy; and the RoTA) and we identify and explain the three main factors that affect performance during training: the domain knowledge of the problem, the number of methods with acceptable performance, and the exploration rate.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2012.091812.111198","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/6361508/06314471.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6361508","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2012.091812.111198","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","startPage":"3878","endPage":"3889","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cognitive Radio Engine Training","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6314471","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"November  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 September 2012","displayDocTitle":"Cognitive Radio Engine Training","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6314471/","volume":"11","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/6314471/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"November 2012","accessionNumber":"13148964","dateOfInsertion":"26 November 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cognitive Radio Engine Training","sourcePdf":"3878-tw1211-volos.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.112216S","chronDate":"November  2012","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6361508","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"6361508","articleId":"6314471","onlineDate":"27 September 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6314473,"authors":[{"name":"Muhammad Ismail","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/6361508/6314473/6314473-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Muhammad Ismail (S'10) received the BSc. and MSc. in Electrical Engineering (Electronics and Communications) from Ain Shams University, Cairo, Egypt in 2007 and 2009, respectively.

Unlike the existing solutions in literature, we consider the simultaneous presence of both single-network and multi-homing services in the networking environment. In single-network services, an MT is assigned to the best wireless access network available at its location. On the other hand, in multi-homing services, an MT utilizes all available wireless access networks simultaneously. The objective of the radio resource allocation is of twofold: to determine the optimal assignment of MTs with single-network service to the available wireless access networks, and to find the corresponding optimal bandwidth allocation to the MTs with single-network and multi-homing services. We develop a sub-optimal decentralized implementation of the radio resource allocation, which relies on network cooperation to perform the allocation in a dynamic environment in an efficient manner. The MT plays an active role in the resource allocation operation, whether by selecting the best available wireless network for single-network services or by determining the required bandwidth share from each available network for multi-homing services. Simulation results are presented to demonstrate the performance of the proposed algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2012.091812.120329","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/6361508/06314473.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2012.091812.120329","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6361508","startPage":"4085","endPage":"4095","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Decentralized Radio Resource Allocation for Single-Network and Multi-Homing Services in Cooperative Heterogeneous Wireless Access Medium","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6314473","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Decentralized Radio Resource Allocation for Single-Network and Multi-Homing Services in Cooperative Heterogeneous Wireless Access Medium","chronOrPublicationDate":"November  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6314473/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 September 2012","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"11","issue":"11","publicationDate":"November 2012","accessionNumber":"13148966","dateOfInsertion":"26 November 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6314473/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Decentralized Radio Resource Allocation for Single-Network and Multi-Homing Services in Cooperative Heterogeneous Wireless Access Medium","sourcePdf":"4085-tw1211-ismail.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.083913S","chronDate":"November  2012","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6361508","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"6361508","articleId":"6314473","onlineDate":"27 September 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6314478,"authors":[{"name":"Simon Gortzen","affiliation":["UMIC Research Centre, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/6333589/6314478/6314478-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Simon G\u00f6rtzen received his Diploma degree in mathematics with a minor in computer science from RWTH Aachen University, Germany, in 2008.

This applies to concave utility functions as well as to practical systems employing adaptive modulation, in which users' data rates can be described by step functions. We show that this discrete resource allocation problem can be formulated as an integer linear program belonging to the class of multiple-choice knapsack problems. As a knapsack problem with additional constraints, this problem is NP-hard, but facilitates approximation algorithms based on Lagrangian relaxation. We show that these dual methods can be described as rounding methods. As an immediate result, we conclude that prior claims of optimality, based on a vanishing duality gap, are insufficient. To answer the question of optimality of dual methods for discrete multicarrier resource allocation problems, we present bounds on the absolute integrality gap for three exemplary downlink resource allocation problems with different objectives when employing rounding methods. The obtained bounds are asymptotically optimal in the sense that the relative performance loss vanishes as the number of subcarriers tends to infinity. The exemplary problems considered in this work are sum rate maximization, sum power minimization and max-min fairness.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimality of Dual Methods for Discrete Multiuser Multicarrier Resource Allocation Problems","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2012.091812.120513","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/6333589/06314478.pdf","startPage":"3810","endPage":"3817","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2012.091812.120513","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6333589","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6314478","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6314478/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 September 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"October  2012","displayDocTitle":"Optimality of Dual Methods for Discrete Multiuser Multicarrier Resource Allocation Problems","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"11","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/6314478/","dateOfInsertion":"18 October 2012","publicationDate":"October 2012","accessionNumber":"13057160","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimality of Dual Methods for Discrete Multiuser Multicarrier Resource Allocation Problems","sourcePdf":"3810-tw1210-gortzen.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.067317S","chronDate":"October  2012","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6333589","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"6333589","articleId":"6314478","onlineDate":"27 September 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6314566,"authors":[{"name":"Abdallah A.

We consider two types of users: primary and secondary users. When active, each secondary transmitter-receiver uses carrier sensing and is subject to long-term energy constraint. We formulate the interaction between primary user and large number of secondary users as an hierarchical mean field game. In contrast to the classical large-scale approaches based on stochastic geometry, percolation theory and large random matrices, the proposed mean field framework allows one to describe the evolution of the density distribution and the associated performance metrics using coupled partial differential equations. We provide explicit formulas and algorithmic power management for both primary and secondary users. A complete characterization of the optimal distribution of energy and probability of success is given.","doi":"10.1109/ACC.2012.6314643","publicationTitle":"2012 American Control Conference (ACC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 American Control Conference (ACC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6297579/6314593/06314643.pdf","startPage":"6388","endPage":"6393","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACC.2012.6314643","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6314593","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Mean field games for cognitive radio networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6314643","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 June 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6314643/","displayDocTitle":"Mean field games for cognitive radio networks","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2012","accessionNumber":"13035611","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6314643/","conferenceDate":"27-29 June 2012","dateOfInsertion":"02 October 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mean field games for cognitive radio networks","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"0090.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057948S","chronDate":"27-29 June 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6297579","isNumber":"6314593","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6297579","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"6314593","articleId":"6314643","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"AACC American Automatic Control Council)","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6314653,"authors":[{"name":"Shankarachary Ragi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, CO, USA"],"firstName":"Shankarachary","lastName":"Ragi","id":"38488750300"},{"name":"Edwin K.

For each topology, the optimal component sizes are determined by optimizing a weighted sum of fuel consumption and powertrain costs. Vehicle performance constraints are imposed to ensure a minimum level of drivability. The constrained optimization problem is solved using Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), and deterministic Dynamic Programming (DP) is used to calculate the optimal fuel consumption. The methodology is applied to a torque-assist and a full-parallel HEV with each three degrees of freedom, i.e. the size of the engine, the motor and the battery. Moreover, we consider two driving cycles: the New European Driving Cycle (NEDC) and a driving cycle with considerable elevation changes. We found that in case of the NEDC, the sizing problem can be reduced to one degree of freedom, whereas in case of the other driving cycle, all three degrees of freedom are required. The latter observation is related to the relative importance of the maximum battery capacity compared with the maximum battery power, but also to the size of the electric motor maximizing energy recuperation.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6314868/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 June 2012","dateOfInsertion":"02 October 2012","publicationDate":"June 2012","accessionNumber":"13035836","htmlLink":"/document/6314868/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"27-29 June 2012","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Cost and fuel-optimal selection of HEV topologies using Particle Swarm Optimization and Dynamic Programming","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cost and fuel-optimal selection of HEV topologies using Particle Swarm Optimization and Dynamic Programming","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"0584.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064118S","chronDate":"27-29 June 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6297579","isNumber":"6314593","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6297579","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"6314593","articleId":"6314868","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"AACC American Automatic Control Council)","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6314869,"authors":[{"name":"Vaibhav Katewa","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Notre Dame, Notre Dame, IN, USA"],"firstName":"Vaibhav","lastName":"Katewa","id":"37945477500"},{"name":"Vijay Gupta","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Notre Dame, Notre Dame, IN, USA"],"firstName":"Vijay","lastName":"Gupta","id":"37271178000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1096-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1095-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-1094-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2102-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2378-5861"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0743-1619"},{"format":"CD","value":"0743-1619"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"0743-1619"}],"articleNumber":"6314869","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":113},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Dynamic programming","Testing","Sensor fusion","Equations","Bayesian methods","Current measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dynamic programming","probability","sensors","testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sequential test optimality","multiple sensors","binary hypothesis testing","sequential detection","randomized sensor selection strategy","dynamic programming","sequential probability ratio test","SPRT","Wald-Wolfowitz theorem"]}],"abstract":"We study the problem of sequential detection for binary hypothesis testing using multiple sensors.

In this paper, we concentrate on PHEV charging in public infrastructures, such as shared parking lots in commercial office campuses and shopping malls. In such clustered scenarios, PHEV charging demand can vary significantly and stochastically with time, and the overall system performance is a result of a trade-off between the peak load on the distribution system and the consumer specified charging deadlines that are met successfully. However, unlike distributed residential charging, those scenarios can benefit from centralized algorithms to schedule the charging of vehicles. This paper considers the design of such scheduling algorithms. We show that through proper design of the scheduling algorithms, the parking lot owner can balance distribution system load with quality of charging service.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 June 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6314939/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"13035907","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6314939/","publicationDate":"June 2012","dateOfInsertion":"02 October 2012","conferenceDate":"27-29 June 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Scheduling algorithms for PHEV charging in shared parking lots","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Scheduling algorithms for PHEV charging in shared parking lots","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"0738.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070237S","chronDate":"27-29 June 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6297579","isNumber":"6314593","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6297579","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"6314593","articleId":"6314939","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"AACC American Automatic Control Council)","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6314977,"authors":[{"name":"Hossein Beikzadeh","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada"],"firstName":"Hossein","lastName":"Beikzadeh","id":"37400589900"},{"name":"Horacio J.

The converter has an auxiliary circuit connected to its DC bus. A model based approach is adopted to design the control system. First, the converter state space model is obtained. Next, a multivariable controller is proposed to stabilize the DC bus capacitor voltages and a backstepping method is utilized to design the controller that compensates the load current harmonics. The filter parameters that represent the power losses are assumed unknown during the design. The controller is therefore provided with adaptation laws that automatically retune the controller parameters when power losses change. The main characteristic of the proposed multivariable adaptive control design method is that it follows the input-output linearization method and uses the internal dynamic variables to stabilize the closed loop system. The performances of the filter are evaluated in simulation. The results demonstrate that load current harmonics are very well compensated. The converter DC-bus voltage is maintained at its reference value and capacitor voltages remain equal when the filter operating conditions change.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6314991/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 June 2012","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"27-29 June 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6314991/","dateOfInsertion":"02 October 2012","publicationDate":"June 2012","accessionNumber":"13035959","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A multivariable adaptive nonlinear controller for a five-level diode clamped active power filter","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A multivariable adaptive nonlinear controller for a five-level diode clamped active power filter","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"0830.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056011S","chronDate":"27-29 June 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6297579","isNumber":"6314593","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6297579","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6314593","articleId":"6314991","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"AACC American Automatic Control Council)","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6315074,"authors":[{"name":"Birgit Vogel-Heuser","affiliation":["Institute for Automation and Information Systems, Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen, Garching, Germany"],"firstName":"Birgit","lastName":"Vogel-Heuser","id":"38277090300"},{"name":"Steven Braun","affiliation":["Institute for Automation and Information Systems, Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen, Garching, Germany"],"firstName":"Steven","lastName":"Braun","id":"38492493800"},{"name":"Martin Obermeier","affiliation":["Institute for Automation and Information Systems, Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen, Garching, Germany"],"firstName":"Martin","lastName":"Obermeier","id":"38317002600"},{"name":"Fabian Jobst","affiliation":["University of Education Weingarten, Weingarten, Germany"],"firstName":"Fabian","lastName":"Jobst","id":"38488422900"},{"name":"Karin Schweizer","affiliation":["Educational psychology, University of Education Weingarten, Weingarten, Germany"],"firstName":"Karin","lastName":"Schweizer","id":"38488501800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1096-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1095-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-1094-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2102-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2378-5861"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0743-1619"},{"format":"CD","value":"0743-1619"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"0743-1619"}],"articleNumber":"6315074","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":276},"abstract":"In machine and plant automation, model-driven object oriented (oo) programming of Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) software is becoming an alternative to the state-of-the-art programming.

Exemplarily, we focus on fast gradient methods and present results from an implementation on a low-cost microcontroller. We show that input quantization in actuators should be exploited in order to determine a suboptimality level of the online optimization that requires a low number of algorithm iterations and might not significantly degrade the performance of the real system. As a case study we consider a Segway-like robot, modeled by a linear time-invariant system with 8 states and 2 inputs subject to box input constraints. The test system runs with a sampling period of 4 ms and uses a horizons up to 20 steps in a hard real-time system with limited CPU time and memory.","doi":"10.1109/ACC.2012.6315076","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACC.2012.6315076","startPage":"1205","endPage":"1210","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 American Control Conference (ACC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6297579/6314593/06315076.pdf","publicationTitle":"2012 American Control Conference (ACC)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6314593","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Implementation aspects of model predictive control for embedded systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 June 2012","displayDocTitle":"Implementation aspects of model predictive control for embedded systems","conferenceDate":"27-29 June 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2012","dateOfInsertion":"02 October 2012","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6315076/","accessionNumber":"13036044","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6315076/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Implementation aspects of model predictive control for embedded systems","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"0999.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057522S","chronDate":"27-29 June 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6297579","isNumber":"6314593","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6297579","citationCount":"34","xplore-issue":"6314593","articleId":"6315076","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"AACC American Automatic Control Council)","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6315089,"authors":[{"name":"Van Cuong Nguyen","affiliation":["IBISC, Universit\u00e9 dEvry Val d'Essonne, Evry, France"],"firstName":"Van Cuong","lastName":"Nguyen","id":"38238479800"},{"name":"Gilney Damm","affiliation":["IBISC, Universit\u00e9 dEvry Val d'Essonne, Evry, France"],"firstName":"Gilney","lastName":"Damm","id":"37360976000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1096-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1095-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-1094-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2102-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2378-5861"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0743-1619"},{"format":"CD","value":"0743-1619"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"0743-1619"}],"articleNumber":"6315089","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":135},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6315089","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Atmospheric modeling","Aerodynamics","Aircraft","Control design","Rockets","Data models","Force"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["aerodynamics","artificial satellites","autonomous aerial vehicles","control system synthesis","force control","inertial systems","perturbation techniques","robust control","rockets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["satellite launching","reusable unmanned aerial vehicle","rocket stage","instantaneous jump","mass","inertia","aerodynamic coefficient","airlaunch system","perturbation","aerodynamic force","aerodynamic moments","robust conditional integrator controller","controller design","system stability"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ACC.2012.6315089","pdfPath":"/iel5/6297579/6314593/06315089.pdf","publicationTitle":"2012 American Control Conference (ACC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 American Control Conference (ACC)","startPage":"1743","endPage":"1748","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6314593","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACC.2012.6315089","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modeling and conditional integrator control of an unmanned aerial vehicle for airlaunch","abstract":"A satellite launching procedure known as air-launch is modeled and simulated at the staging phase, where a reusable unmanned aerial vehicle airlaunchs a second (rocket) stage.

The complicated sound field in reverberant environments limits the spatial volume of efficient sound control. At higher frequencies, damping is in general possible only within a small volume around a control microphone when using a single loudspeaker to produce the control signal. We here investigate how the spatial volume of control, as well as the upper limiting frequency, can be increased by using MIMO feedforward control that uses all loudspeakers of a premium car HiFi system. The results indicate that performance is improved for narrowband as well as broadband noise, resulting in a considerable noise reduction within a 0.3 \u00d7 0.3 m area. Compared to a corresponding SISO design that uses one loudspeaker and is optimized for one measurement position, the measured noise damping is improved and the upper limit frequency for control over the whole area is more than doubled, from 200 Hz to 450 Hz. The design requires high-precision identification of acoustic transfer functions from all involved loudspeakers as well as accurate modeling of noise paths.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MIMO design of Active Noise Controllers for car interiors: Extending the silenced region at higher frequencies","publicationTitle":"2012 American Control Conference (ACC)","doi":"10.1109/ACC.2012.6315123","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 American Control Conference (ACC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6297579/6314593/06315123.pdf","startPage":"6140","endPage":"6147","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACC.2012.6315123","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6314593","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6315123","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6315123/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 June 2012","displayDocTitle":"MIMO design of Active Noise Controllers for car interiors: Extending the silenced region at higher frequencies","conferenceDate":"27-29 June 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6315123/","dateOfInsertion":"02 October 2012","publicationDate":"June 2012","accessionNumber":"13036091","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MIMO design of Active Noise Controllers for car interiors: Extending the silenced region at higher frequencies","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"1069.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058149S","chronDate":"27-29 June 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6297579","isNumber":"6314593","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6297579","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6314593","articleId":"6315123","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"AACC American Automatic Control Council)","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6315132,"authors":[{"name":"Mingfeng Zhang","affiliation":["Institute for AeroSpace Studies, University of Toronto, Toronto, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Mingfeng","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37539176600"},{"name":"Hugh H.T.

The objective is to partition a given segment into non-overlapping sub-segments, each assigned to a different camera to patrol. Each camera has both physical mobility range and limited speed, and it must patrol its assigned sub-segment by sweeping it back and forth at maximum speed. Here we first review the solution for the centralized optimal partitioning. Then we propose two different distributed control strategies to determine the extremes of the optimal patrolling areas of each camera. Both these strategies require only local communication with the neighboring cameras but adopt different communication schemes, respectively, symmetric gossip and asynchronous asymmetric broadcast. The first scheme is shown to be provably convergent to the optimal solution. Some theoretical insights are provided also for the second scheme whose effectiveness is validated through numerical simulations.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 June 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6315145/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"13036113","publicationDate":"June 2012","conferenceDate":"27-29 June 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6315145/","dateOfInsertion":"02 October 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Multi-agent perimeter patrolling subject to mobility constraints","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-agent perimeter patrolling subject to mobility constraints","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"1097.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065987S","chronDate":"27-29 June 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6297579","isNumber":"6314593","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6297579","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"6314593","articleId":"6315145","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"AACC American Automatic Control Council)","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6315163,"authors":[{"name":"Amirpasha Shirazinia","affiliation":["KTH Royal Inst. of Tech."],"firstName":"Amirpasha","lastName":"Shirazinia","id":"37712578200"},{"name":"Lei Bao","affiliation":["Royal Inst. of Tech.

It is presented and applied in a laboratory test case which is representative of low-cost navigation for ground vehicles. The method exploits the dynamics of a scalar field obtained by weighting and averaging the brightness perceived by two embedded neighboring cameras. To be more specific, the cameras are complemented with a gyrometer to retrieve the curvilinear velocity of the moving rigid body. The proposed method is first tested on synthetic data, then on real data, and shows robustness to poor quality of image data. Significant levels of noise and blur are tested; in addition, this method does not require high resolution images, as opposed to any existing methods based on triangulation and tracking of keypoints.","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 American Control Conference (ACC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6297579/6314593/06315184.pdf","startPage":"4108","endPage":"4115","publicationTitle":"2012 American Control Conference (ACC)","doi":"10.1109/ACC.2012.6315184","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACC.2012.6315184","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6314593","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6315184","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Curvilinear velocity estimation using low-quality stereo-vision systems and a gyrometer","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cameras","Optical imaging","Mathematical model","Trajectory","Equations","Adaptive optics","Observers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image sensors","mobile robots","robot vision","stereo image processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["curvilinear velocity estimation","low-quality stereo-vision systems","gyrometer","rigid body velocity estimation","laboratory test case","low-cost navigation","ground vehicles","scalar field dynamics","embedded neighboring cameras","triangulation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6315184/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 June 2012","displayDocTitle":"Curvilinear velocity estimation using low-quality stereo-vision systems and a gyrometer","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6315184/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2012","accessionNumber":"13036152","dateOfInsertion":"02 October 2012","conferenceDate":"27-29 June 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Curvilinear velocity estimation using low-quality stereo-vision systems and a gyrometer","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"1144.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065806S","chronDate":"27-29 June 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6297579","isNumber":"6314593","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6297579","xplore-issue":"6314593","articleId":"6315184","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"AACC American Automatic Control Council)","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6315231,"authors":[{"name":"D.

A null motion strategy is exploited to simultaneously perform the gimbal reconfiguration for singularity avoidance and wheel speed reg-ularization for internal momentum management.

The DNN-based observer works in conjunction with a dynamic filter for state estimation using only output measurements during on-line operation. A sliding mode term is added to the DNN structure to robustly account for exogenous disturbances and reconstruction errors. Weight update laws for the DNN, based on estimation, tracking errors, and filter output are proposed which guarantee global asymptotic regulation of the estimation error. A combination of a neural network feedforward term, along with estimated state feedback and sliding mode terms yields a global asymptotic tracking result.

We prove that the bias introduced in the optimization can be removed by a simple correction that depends on the stationary distribution of the consensus matrix.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed dual averaging for convex optimization under communication delays","publicationTitle":"2012 American Control Conference (ACC)","doi":"10.1109/ACC.2012.6315289","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 American Control Conference (ACC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6297579/6314593/06315289.pdf","startPage":"1067","endPage":"1072","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACC.2012.6315289","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6314593","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6315289","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6315289/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 June 2012","displayDocTitle":"Distributed dual averaging for convex optimization under communication delays","conferenceDate":"27-29 June 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6315289/","dateOfInsertion":"02 October 2012","publicationDate":"June 2012","accessionNumber":"13036256","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed dual averaging for convex optimization under communication delays","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"1316.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.104276S","chronDate":"27-29 June 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6297579","isNumber":"6314593","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6297579","citationCount":"57","xplore-issue":"6314593","articleId":"6315289","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"AACC American Automatic Control Council","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6315304,"authors":[{"name":"Anton Cervin","affiliation":["Department of Automatic Control LTH, Lund University, Lund, Sweden"],"firstName":"Anton","lastName":"Cervin","id":"37298817000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1096-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1095-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-1094-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2102-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2378-5861"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0743-1619"},{"format":"CD","value":"0743-1619"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"0743-1619"}],"articleNumber":"6315304","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":23,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":249},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6315304","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Jitter","Delay","Approximation methods","Stability criteria","Logic gates","Integrated circuit modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["delays","embedded systems","feedback","jitter","linear systems","networked control systems","sampled data systems","stability","time-varying systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["stability","worst-case performance analysis","input jitter","output jitter","feedback controller","networked embedded system","control loop","time-varying delays","linear sampled-data control systems"]}],"abstract":"When a feedback controller is implemented in a networked embedded system, the computations and communications induce delays and jitter, which may destabilize the control loop. The majority of previous work on analysis of control loops with time-varying delays has focused on output (actuation) jitter. In many embedded systems, input (sampling) jitter is also an issue. In this paper, we analyze the combined effect of input and output jitter on the stability and performance of linear sampled-data control systems. The analysis is performed via a loop transformation involving two time-varying uncertainties. We show how the input-output gains of the linear part of the transformed system can be computed using a fast-sampling/fast-hold approximation. At the same time, we reduce the conservativeness of a previous stability theorem for pure output jitter.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6314593","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACC.2012.6315304","publicationTitle":"2012 American Control Conference (ACC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 American Control Conference (ACC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6297579/6314593/06315304.pdf","startPage":"3760","endPage":"3765","doi":"10.1109/ACC.2012.6315304","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Stability and worst-case performance analysis of sampled-data control systems with input and output jitter","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 June 2012","displayDocTitle":"Stability and worst-case performance analysis of sampled-data control systems with input and output jitter","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"27-29 June 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6315304/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2012","accessionNumber":"13036271","dateOfInsertion":"02 October 2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6315304/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Stability and worst-case performance analysis of sampled-data control systems with input and output jitter","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"1339.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045668S","chronDate":"27-29 June 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6297579","isNumber":"6314593","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6297579","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"6314593","articleId":"6315304","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"AACC American Automatic Control Council)","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6315307,"authors":[{"name":"Daniel U.

The problem is formulated as finding the correct transmission power to achieve a desired quality of service (QoS), described by an objective signal-to-interference and noise ratio (SINR). First, the model of the MC-CDMA is described, and by considering a matched filter at the receiver, the SINR after data estimation is explicitly characterized. Due to the diversity in MC-CDMA systems, the power assignment problem is approached with a minimum norm perspective restricted to achieve a pre-defined objective SINR per user. Centralized and distributed solutions are presented in the paper. The distributed power allocation strategy is further extended to consider general controllers, and measurement and processing delays. Necessary conditions for closed-loop stability and convergence to the optimal minimum norm solution are derived by using the small-gain theorem. One advantage of the proposed methodology is that it can use power control strategies previously suggested for CDMA systems, as the Foschini-Miljanic scheme and LQ-control.","doi":"10.1109/ACC.2012.6315307","publicationTitle":"2012 American Control Conference (ACC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 American Control Conference (ACC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6297579/6314593/06315307.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACC.2012.6315307","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6314593","startPage":"466","endPage":"471","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed power control in quasi-synchronous multi-carrier CDMA systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6315307","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Distributed power control in quasi-synchronous multi-carrier CDMA systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 June 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6315307/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"27-29 June 2012","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2012","accessionNumber":"13036274","dateOfInsertion":"02 October 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6315307/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed power control in quasi-synchronous multi-carrier CDMA systems","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"1348.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.079338S","chronDate":"27-29 June 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6297579","isNumber":"6314593","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6297579","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6314593","articleId":"6315307","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"AACC American Automatic Control Council)","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6315309,"authors":[{"name":"Cinthia J.

In particular, the rapidly rising energy prices and the increasing power consumption levels in current wireless network constitute a major concern for network operators. In this context, we introduce here a cross-layer approach that allows optimization of the overall power resource adaptively for a commercial DS-CDMA wireless network. First, this approach maximizes the network's utility, as a function of the signal to interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR), by considering adaptively the changes in the three most important network characteristics, that is, the total consumed power, the effective bandwidth and the average user throughput. Then the detector selection and closed-loop power control units are addressed as the main components to reach the required QoS with the lowest power consumption. Simulation results show that substantial utility gains may be achieved by improving the power efficiency in the network.","doi":"10.1109/ACC.2012.6315309","publicationTitle":"2012 American Control Conference (ACC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 American Control Conference (ACC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6297579/6314593/06315309.pdf","startPage":"2018","endPage":"2023","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACC.2012.6315309","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6314593","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A cross-layer power allocation scheme for CDMA wireless networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6315309","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 June 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6315309/","displayDocTitle":"A cross-layer power allocation scheme for CDMA wireless networks","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2012","accessionNumber":"13036276","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6315309/","conferenceDate":"27-29 June 2012","dateOfInsertion":"02 October 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A cross-layer power allocation scheme for CDMA wireless networks","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"1350.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.085541S","chronDate":"27-29 June 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6297579","isNumber":"6314593","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6297579","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6314593","articleId":"6315309","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"AACC American Automatic Control Council)","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6315323,"authors":[{"name":"Ying Luo","affiliation":["Samsung Information Systems America, Inc., San Jose, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Ying","lastName":"Luo","id":"37400250700"},{"name":"Tao Zhang","affiliation":["Samsung Information Systems America, Inc., San Jose, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Tao","lastName":"Zhang","id":"38488699600"},{"name":"Li Zhou","affiliation":["Samsung Information Systems America, Inc., San Jose, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Li","lastName":"Zhou","id":"38488671800"},{"name":"BongJin Lee","affiliation":["Samsung Information Systems America, Inc., San Jose, CA, USA"],"firstName":"BongJin","lastName":"Lee","id":"38488405500"},{"name":"Changik Kang","affiliation":["Samsung Information Systems America, Inc., San Jose, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Changik","lastName":"Kang","id":"37069588700"},{"name":"YangQuan Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Utah State University, Logan, UT, USA"],"firstName":"YangQuan","lastName":"Chen","id":"37281026000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1096-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1095-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-1094-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2102-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2378-5861"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0743-1619"},{"format":"CD","value":"0743-1619"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"0743-1619"}],"articleNumber":"6315323","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":110},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6315323","abstract":"This paper suggests a pre-filtering and head-dependent adaptive feed-forward (AFF) control scheme for vibration compensation in hard-disc-drive (HDD) servo system.

The objective is to drive the system as fast as possible from an initial position to a final position without violating system constraints. These constraints can be the actuator limits or the maximal allowable pitch and roll angles. By deriving the extrema of the nominal control inputs to be applied along the reference trajectories as well as the nominal angles that the system will achieve, the solutions to the trajectory planning are obtained by using simple equations. The proposed approach is applied to the quadrotor UAV test-bed of the Networked Autonomous Vehicles (NAV) Laboratory of Concordia University where sliding mode controller and linear quadratic regulator are implemented, tested and compared.","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 American Control Conference (ACC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6297579/6314593/06315362.pdf","startPage":"920","endPage":"925","publicationTitle":"2012 American Control Conference (ACC)","doi":"10.1109/ACC.2012.6315362","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACC.2012.6315362","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6314593","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6315362","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Flatness-based trajectory planning for a quadrotor Unmanned Aerial Vehicle test-bed considering actuator and system constraints","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Trajectory","Planning","Pulse width modulation","Polynomials","Mathematical model","Radio frequency","Actuators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["actuators","autonomous aerial vehicles","helicopters","linear quadratic control","nonlinear control systems","path planning","trajectory control","variable structure systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["flatness-based trajectory planning","quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicle test-bed","actuator constraints","system constraints","UAV system","actuator limits","maximal allowable pitch","roll angles","nominal control inputs","nominal angles","Networked Autonomous Vehicles Laboratory","NAV Laboratory","Concordia University","sliding mode controller","linear quadratic regulator"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6315362/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 June 2012","displayDocTitle":"Flatness-based trajectory planning for a quadrotor Unmanned Aerial Vehicle test-bed considering actuator and system constraints","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6315362/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2012","accessionNumber":"13036329","dateOfInsertion":"02 October 2012","conferenceDate":"27-29 June 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Flatness-based trajectory planning for a quadrotor Unmanned Aerial Vehicle test-bed considering actuator and system constraints","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"1453.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055216S","chronDate":"27-29 June 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6297579","isNumber":"6314593","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6297579","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"6314593","articleId":"6315362","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"AACC American Automatic Control Council)","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6315363,"authors":[{"name":"Abbas Chamseddine","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical & Industrial Engineering, Concordia University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada"],"firstName":"Abbas","lastName":"Chamseddine","id":"37299878800"},{"name":"Youmin Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical & Industrial Engineering, Concordia University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada"],"firstName":"Youmin","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37086728461"},{"name":"Camille Alain Rabbath","affiliation":["Department of National Defense, Defence Research and Development Canada (DRDC), Valcartier, Quebec, Canada"],"firstName":"Camille Alain","lastName":"Rabbath","id":"37299062000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1096-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1095-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-1094-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2102-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2378-5861"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0743-1619"},{"format":"CD","value":"0743-1619"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"0743-1619"}],"articleNumber":"6315363","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":26,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1007},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Trajectory","Planning","Vehicles","Rotors","Fault tolerance","Fault tolerant systems","Actuators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["autonomous aerial vehicles","fault tolerance","helicopters","trajectory control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["trajectory planning","trajectory replanning","fault tolerant formation flight control","quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicle","fault tolerant control","virtual structure formation framework","differential flatness","UAV"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6315363","abstract":"This paper proposes an approach for fault tolerant control of quadrotor UAVs in formation flight.

Grid integrated energy storage combined with fast-ramping conventional generation can help to address challenges associated with power output variability. This paper proposes a risk mitigating optimal power flow (OPF) framework to study the dispatch and placement of energy storage units in a power system with wind generators that are supplemented by fast-ramping conventional back-up generators. This OPF with storage charge/discharge dynamics is solved as a finite-horizon optimal control problem. Chance constraints are used to implement the risk mitigation strategy. The model is applied to case studies based on the IEEE 14 bus benchmark system. First, we study the scheduling of spinning reserves and storage when generation and loads are subject to uncertainties. The framework is then extended to investigate the optimal placement of storage across different network topologies. The results of the case studies quantify the need for storage and reserves as well as suggest a strategy for their scheduling and placement.","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 American Control Conference (ACC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6297579/6314593/06315377.pdf","startPage":"4431","endPage":"4437","publicationTitle":"2012 American Control Conference (ACC)","doi":"10.1109/ACC.2012.6315377","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACC.2012.6315377","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6314593","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6315377","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Risk-mitigated optimal power flow for wind powered grids","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Energy storage","Generators","Spinning","Planning","Wind power generation","Network topology","Wind forecasting"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["load flow","optimal control","power generation control","power grids","renewable energy sources","risk management","wind power plants"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["risk-mitigated optimal power flow","wind powered grids","renewable energy sources","fast-ramping conventional generation","OPF framework","power system","fast-ramping conventional back-up generators","finite-horizon optimal control problem","IEEE 14 bus","risk mitigation strategy"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6315377/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 June 2012","displayDocTitle":"Risk-mitigated optimal power flow for wind powered grids","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6315377/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2012","accessionNumber":"13036344","dateOfInsertion":"02 October 2012","conferenceDate":"27-29 June 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Risk-mitigated optimal power flow for wind powered grids","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"1481.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.087085S","chronDate":"27-29 June 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6297579","isNumber":"6314593","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6297579","citationCount":"48","xplore-issue":"6314593","articleId":"6315377","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"AACC American Automatic Control Council)","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6315393,"authors":[{"name":"Huazhen Fang","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical & Aerospace Engineering, University of California, San Diego, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Huazhen","lastName":"Fang","id":"38236507600"},{"name":"Raymond A. de Callafon","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical & Aerospace Engineering, University of California, San Diego, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Raymond A.","lastName":"de Callafon","id":"37265784500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1096-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1095-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-1094-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2102-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2378-5861"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0743-1619"},{"format":"CD","value":"0743-1619"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"0743-1619"}],"articleNumber":"6315393","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":201},"abstract":"This paper analyzes the peak covariance stability properties of Kalman filtering for linear discrete-time systems with irregular time intervals for sampling of output measurements.

In addition, the approach can significantly reduce the imaging time in applications such as force mapping in which the tip is moved point-by-point through a sequence of measurement locations rather than continuously scanned as in standard imaging.","doi":"10.1109/ACC.2012.6315406","publicationTitle":"2012 American Control Conference (ACC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 American Control Conference (ACC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6297579/6314593/06315406.pdf","startPage":"2485","endPage":"2490","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACC.2012.6315406","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6314593","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Non-raster sampling in atomic force microscopy: A compressed sensing approach","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6315406","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 June 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6315406/","displayDocTitle":"Non-raster sampling in atomic force microscopy: A compressed sensing approach","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2012","accessionNumber":"13036373","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6315406/","conferenceDate":"27-29 June 2012","dateOfInsertion":"02 October 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Non-raster sampling in atomic force microscopy: A compressed sensing approach","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"1536.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063031S","chronDate":"27-29 June 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6297579","isNumber":"6314593","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6297579","citationCount":"37","xplore-issue":"6314593","articleId":"6315406","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"AACC American Automatic Control Council)","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":6315415,"authors":[{"name":"Jianxiao Zou","affiliation":["School of Automation Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Jianxiao","lastName":"Zou","id":"37672755100"},{"name":"Junping Yao","affiliation":["School of Automation Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Junping","lastName":"Yao","id":"38488478700"},{"name":"Qingze Zou","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical and AeroSpace Engineering, Rutgers, the State University of New Jersey, Piscataway, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Qingze","lastName":"Zou","id":"37305247600"},{"name":"Hongbing Xu","affiliation":["School of Automation Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Hongbing","lastName":"Xu","id":"37403568900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1096-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1095-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-1094-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2102-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2378-5861"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0743-1619"},{"format":"CD","value":"0743-1619"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"0743-1619"}],"articleNumber":"6315415","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":872},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wind turbines","Wind farms","Resource management","Power control","Optimization","Wind power generation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","optimal control","power control","power generation control","power grids","wind power plants","wind turbines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiobjective optimization approach","wind-farm-generated power","power grid","wind-farm power control","wind-farm output power","wind-turbine output power","optimal active power control scheme","individual wind turbine","ultrashort term power prediction","active power allocation","improved genetic algorithm","improved GA","wind-farm model"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Active wind-farm power control","active power allocation","multi-objective optimization"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6315415","abstract":"With more and more wind farms integrated into the grid, the stability and security of the grid can be significantly affected by the wind-farm-generated power, due to the intermittent and volatile nature of the wind-farm-generated power. Therefore, control of the wind farm power to meet the stability and quality requirements of the power grid becomes important. Active power control of wind-farm, however, is challenging because the wind-farm output power can only be reliably predicted for a short period of time (i.e., ultra-short term power prediction), and large variations exist in the wind-turbine output power. In this paper, an optimal active power control scheme is proposed to maximize the running time of each individual wind turbine, and minimize the switching of wind turbines. Particularly, the ultra-short term power prediction is utilized to quantify the available output power of each wind turbine, and the wind turbines are classified according to the running conditions and the available powers. Then, the active power allocation is formulated as a multi-objective optimization problem and solved by using an improved genetic algorithm (GA). The proposed approach is illustrated by implementing it to the active allocation of a wind-farm model in simulation. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method to the active power allocation outperforms the conventional average method, and optimally distributes active power among the wind turbines.","doi":"10.1109/ACC.2012.6315415","startPage":"4381","endPage":"4386","publicationTitle":"2012 American Control Conference (ACC)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACC.2012.6315415","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6314593","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 American Control Conference (ACC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6297579/6314593/06315415.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A multi-objective optimization approach to active power control of wind farms","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6315415/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A multi-objective optimization approach to active power control of wind farms","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6315415/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"13036382","publicationDate":"June 2012","dateOfInsertion":"02 October 2012","conferenceDate":"27-29 June 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 June 2012","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A multi-objective optimization approach to active power control of wind farms","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"1559.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074388S","chronDate":"27-29 June 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6297579","isNumber":"6314593","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6297579","xplore-issue":"6314593","articleId":"6315415","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"AACC American Automatic Control Council","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6315419,"authors":[{"name":"Sertac Karaman","affiliation":["Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Sertac","lastName":"Karaman","id":"37304113000"},{"name":"Emilio Frazzoli","affiliation":["Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Emilio","lastName":"Frazzoli","id":"37283368500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1096-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1095-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-1094-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2102-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2378-5861"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0743-1619"},{"format":"CD","value":"0743-1619"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"0743-1619"}],"articleNumber":"6315419","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":32,"citationCountPatent":5,"totalDownloads":1016},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Games","Trajectory","Reactive power","Periodic structures","Algorithm design and analysis","Mathematical model"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automobiles","control engineering computing","deterministic algorithms","formal specification","game theory","graph theory","memoryless systems","optimal control","path planning","probability","sampling methods","trajectory control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sampling-based algorithms","optimal motion planning","deterministic \u03bc-calculus specifications","high-level specification languages","cost function","optimal trajectory synthesis","deterministic mu-calculus","rapidly-exploring random graphs","RRG","probabilistic completeness","asymptotic optimality guarantees","curvature constrained car","memoryless winning strategies","infinite parity games","automatic control program generation"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6315419","abstract":"Automatic generation of control programs that satisfy complex task specifications given in high-level specification languages such as temporal logics has been studied extensively.

In this paper, we study the problem of optimal trajectory synthesis for a large class of specifications, given in the form of deterministic mu-calculus. We propose a sampling-based algorithm, based on the Rapidly-exploring Random Graphs (RRGs), that solves this problem with probabilistic completeness and asymptotic optimality guarantees. We evaluate our algorithm in a simulation studies involving a curvature constrained car. Our simulation results show that in this scenario the algorithm quickly discovers a trajectory that satisfies the specification, and improves this trajectory towards an optimal one if allowed more computation time. We also point out connections to (optimal) memoryless winning strategies in infinite parity games, which may be of independent interest.","doi":"10.1109/ACC.2012.6315419","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACC.2012.6315419","startPage":"735","endPage":"742","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 American Control Conference (ACC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6297579/6314593/06315419.pdf","publicationTitle":"2012 American Control Conference (ACC)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6314593","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sampling-based algorithms for optimal motion planning with deterministic \u03bc-calculus specifications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 June 2012","displayDocTitle":"Sampling-based algorithms for optimal motion planning with deterministic \u03bc-calculus specifications","conferenceDate":"27-29 June 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2012","dateOfInsertion":"02 October 2012","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6315419/","accessionNumber":"13036386","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6315419/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sampling-based algorithms for optimal motion planning with deterministic \u03bc-calculus specifications","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"1567.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061576S","chronDate":"27-29 June 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6297579","isNumber":"6314593","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6297579","citationCount":"32","xplore-issue":"6314593","articleId":"6315419","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"AACC American Automatic Control Council)","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6315432,"authors":[{"name":"Pieter Janssens","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering, Division PMA, Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Heverlee, Belgium"],"firstName":"Pieter","lastName":"Janssens","id":"37945112700"},{"name":"Goele Pipeleers","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering, Division PMA, Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Heverlee, Belgium"],"firstName":"Goele","lastName":"Pipeleers","id":"37322615600"},{"name":"Jan Swevers","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering, Division PMA, Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Heverlee, Belgium"],"firstName":"Jan","lastName":"Swevers","id":"37322616700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1096-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1095-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-1094-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2102-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2378-5861"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0743-1619"},{"format":"CD","value":"0743-1619"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"0743-1619"}],"articleNumber":"6315432","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":14,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":205},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6315432","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Trajectory","Permanent magnet motors","Feedforward neural networks","Forging","Force","Friction","Tracking"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feedforward","iterative methods","learning systems","linear motors","linear systems","machine control","open loop systems","permanent magnet motors","trajectory control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ILC initialization","trajectory learning","iterative learning control","open-loop control strategy","system input learning","trajectory tracking","linear time-invariant systems","disturbance model","permanent magnet linear motor","model-based feedforward control scheme","motion trajectory"]}],"abstract":"Iterative learning control (ILC) is an open-loop control strategy that learns the system input to track a desired trajectory from previous executions.

This paper presents a novel methodology for linear time-invariant systems to calculate a better initialization of an ILC based on a previously learned similar trajectory and a disturbance model. To illustrate the potential of the developed method, it is applied to a permanent magnet linear motor and compared to a model-based feedforward control scheme.

Repetitive control (RC) is a simple and effective scheme to obtain good tracking of such reference trajectories. However, the highly resonant dynamics of the positioning stage combined with hysteresis and creep behavior in the piezoelectric actuator can degrade performance and even make creating a stable RC system difficult. In this paper, a damping proportional-integral (PI) controller is combined with a repetitive controller for robustness and high performance. Compared to a regular PI controller, the modified PI controller introduces damping, increases the bandwidth, and reduces the overall noise level due to feedback. Also, due to the integral action, the hysteresis and creep nonlinearities inherent in the piezoelectric actuator is minimized. A novel method for tuning the PI controller is proposed. The control approach is applied to a custom-design flexure-guided nanopositioning system with a dominant resonance of approximately 725 Hz.

First under the assumption that the state vector of the local subsystem is only measurable, a single neural network (NN)-based decentralized tracking controller is introduced to overcome the unknown internal dynamics as well as the control gain matrix of each subsystem. The NN weights are tuned online by using a novel update law, and thus, no offline training is employed. By using Lyapunov techniques, all subsystems signals are shown to be uniformly ultimately bounded (UUB). Next, the tracking problem is considered by using output feedback via a nonlinear NN observer. Lyapunov techniques demonstrate that the subsystems states, NN weight estimation errors, and state estimation errors are all UUB. Simulation results are provided on interconnected nonlinear discrete-time systems in affine form and on a power system with excitation control to show the effectiveness of the approach.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 June 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6315493/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"13036460","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6315493/","publicationDate":"June 2012","dateOfInsertion":"02 October 2012","conferenceDate":"27-29 June 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Decentralized adaptive neural network state and output feedback control of a class of interconnected nonlinear discrete-time systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Decentralized adaptive neural network state and output feedback control of a class of interconnected nonlinear discrete-time systems","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"1722.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075477S","chronDate":"27-29 June 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6297579","isNumber":"6314593","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6297579","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6314593","articleId":"6315493","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"AACC American Automatic Control Council)","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6315533,"authors":[{"name":"Aranya Chakrabortty","affiliation":["Electrical & Computer Engineering, North Carolina State University"],"firstName":"Aranya","lastName":"Chakrabortty","id":"37295891300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1096-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1095-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-1094-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2102-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2378-5861"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0743-1619"},{"format":"CD","value":"0743-1619"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"0743-1619"}],"articleNumber":"6315533","dbTime":"54 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":237},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Thyristors","Power capacitors","Phasor measurement units","Damping","Oscillators","Power system dynamics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["closed loop systems","control system synthesis","damping","flexible AC transmission systems","phasor measurement","power transmission control","reduced order systems","thyristor applications"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power system wide-area damping control","FACTS-based redesigns","flexible AC transmission system-based control design","electromechanical oscillation damping","synchronized phasor measurements","model reduction","synchrophasors","closed-loop transient response","control inversion","aggregate control design","TCSC controllers","full-order model","interarea responses","intermachine responses","reduced-order system","closed-loop signal","thyristor controlled series compensators"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Power systems","damping control","model reduction","swing equation","model reference control"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6315533","doi":"10.1109/ACC.2012.6315533","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACC.2012.6315533","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6314593","publicationTitle":"2012 American Control Conference (ACC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 American Control Conference (ACC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6297579/6314593/06315533.pdf","startPage":"4446","endPage":"4451","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Wide-area damping control of power systems using clustering and FACTS-based redesigns","abstract":"In this paper we present a FACTS (Flexible AC Transmission Systems)-based control design for electromechanical oscillation damping in large power systems, facilitated by aggregate models that can be constructed using Synchronized phasor measurements. Our approach consists of three steps, namely - 1. Model Reduction, where Synchrophasors are used to identify second-order models of the oscillation clusters of the power system retaining the inter-ties on which FACTS devices such as Thyristor Controlled Series Compensators (TCSC) are installed, 2. Aggregate Control, where feedback controllers are designed to achieve a desired closed-loop transient response between every pair of clusters, and finally 3. Control Inversion, where the aggregate control design is distributed and tuned to actual TCSC controllers in the full-order model until its inter-area responses match the respective inter-machine responses of the reduced-order system. It is shown that the inversion problem can be posed equivalently as decomposing the swing dynamics into fast and slow states, and designing the controllers such that the slow dynamics can optimally track a desired closed-loop signal designed for the aggregate model.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6315533/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 June 2012","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"27-29 June 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6315533/","dateOfInsertion":"02 October 2012","publicationDate":"June 2012","accessionNumber":"13036500","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Wide-area damping control of power systems using clustering and FACTS-based redesigns","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wide-area damping control of power systems using clustering and FACTS-based redesigns","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"1805.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.103162S","chronDate":"27-29 June 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6297579","isNumber":"6314593","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6297579","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6314593","articleId":"6315533","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"AACC American Automatic Control Council)","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6315551,"authors":[{"name":"Tao Yang","affiliation":["Coordinated Science Laboratory and the Department of Mechanical Science and Engineering, University of Illinois, Urbana Champaign, USA"],"firstName":"Tao","lastName":"Yang","id":"38183756500"},{"name":"Geng Huang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, UIUC, USA"],"firstName":"Geng","lastName":"Huang","id":"38488774000"},{"name":"Prashant G.

The positioner is represented as a linear system preceded by hysteresis, which is modeled with a Prandtl-Ishlinskii (PI) operator. In order to reduce the hysteresis effect, an approximate operator is used as a feedforward compensator. A sliding mode controller is then used to mitigate the effect of inversion error. In existing work on sliding mode control of piezo-actuated systems, the coefficient of the switching component of the control is typically chosen by trial and error. In contrast, in this work we analytically derive an upper bound on the inversion error using the hysteresis model. This bound is a function of the state and time, which is much less conservative than constant bounds. The stability of the closed-loop system is established by Lyapnuov analysis. Simulation and experimental results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.","doi":"10.1109/ACC.2012.6315559","startPage":"3825","endPage":"3830","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 American Control Conference (ACC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6297579/6314593/06315559.pdf","publicationTitle":"2012 American Control Conference (ACC)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACC.2012.6315559","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6314593","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sliding-mode tracking control of piezo-actuated nanopositioners","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hysteresis","Vectors","Switches","Nanopositioning","Computational modeling","Trajectory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["approximation theory","closed loop systems","compensation","feedforward","linear systems","Lyapunov methods","nanopositioning","piezoelectric actuators","robust control","time-varying systems","tracking","variable structure systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sliding-mode tracking control","piezo-actuated nanopositioners","robust control scheme","arbitrary reference tracking","linear system","Prandtl-Ishlinskii operator","hysteresis effect","approximate operator","feedforward compensator","inversion error effect mitigation","piezo-actuated systems","switching component","trial-and-error","hysteresis model","closed-loop system stability","Lyapnuov analysis","piezoelectric actuators"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6315559/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 June 2012","displayDocTitle":"Sliding-mode tracking control of piezo-actuated nanopositioners","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6315559/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2012","dateOfInsertion":"02 October 2012","conferenceDate":"27-29 June 2012","accessionNumber":"13036526","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sliding-mode tracking control of piezo-actuated nanopositioners","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"1855.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072739S","chronDate":"27-29 June 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6297579","isNumber":"6314593","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6297579","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"6314593","articleId":"6315559","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"AACC American Automatic Control Council)","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6315572,"authors":[{"name":"Jing Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer engineering, Iowa State University, Ames, IA, USA"],"firstName":"Jing","lastName":"Wang","id":"37280525700"},{"name":"Nicola Elia","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer engineering, Iowa State University, Ames, IA, USA"],"firstName":"Nicola","lastName":"Elia","id":"37265777900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1096-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1095-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-1094-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2102-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2378-5861"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0743-1619"},{"format":"CD","value":"0743-1619"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"0743-1619"}],"articleNumber":"6315572","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":18,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":244},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Laplace equations","Optimization","Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","Heuristic algorithms","Stability analysis","Symmetric matrices","Equations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed algorithms","gradient methods","least squares approximations","optimisation","radio links","telecommunication network reliability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["intermittent communications","distributed algorithm","unconstrained distributed least squares optimization problems","communication links","iterative algorithm","convergence analysis","internal structure decomposition","stochastic systems theory","gradient information","unreliable communications"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6315572","doi":"10.1109/ACC.2012.6315572","publicationTitle":"2012 American Control Conference (ACC)","abstract":"In this paper, we present a distributed algorithm to solve unconstrained distributed Least Squares optimization problems over networks where the communication links could stochastically break.

It is based on a modified three-dimensional Line-of-Sight (LOS) guidance law with integral action and three adaptive feedback controllers. The traditional LOS guidance technique is often used in the marine field for path following purposes. It is however highly susceptible to environmental disturbances such as unknown currents. The integral effect is hence successfully introduced to counteract the current and the chosen integration law is defined to reduce the risk of wind-up effects.

In this paper, the controller is designed to accommodate systems with time delay arising due to capacitive sensing. The improvement in the lateral scanning bandwidth of a high-speed flexure based scanner for a commercial scanning probe microscope is presented. It is shown that by damping the resonant modes of the lateral axis, the scanning speed can be increased from 65 Hz to 200 Hz. The high gain integral feedback improves the tracking performance of nanopositioner and overcomes the hysteresis. Open loop and closed loop scanning performances are compared up to 200 Hz line rates. Limitations and suggestions for improvement of the nanopositioner performance are discussed.","doi":"10.1109/ACC.2012.6315608","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACC.2012.6315608","startPage":"3811","endPage":"3816","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 American Control Conference (ACC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6297579/6314593/06315608.pdf","publicationTitle":"2012 American Control Conference (ACC)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6314593","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analog implementation of a damping and tracking controller for a high-speed X-Y nanopositioner","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 June 2012","displayDocTitle":"Analog implementation of a damping and tracking controller for a high-speed X-Y nanopositioner","conferenceDate":"27-29 June 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2012","dateOfInsertion":"02 October 2012","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6315608/","accessionNumber":"13036575","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6315608/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analog implementation of a damping and tracking controller for a high-speed X-Y nanopositioner","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"1955.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052823S","chronDate":"27-29 June 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6297579","isNumber":"6314593","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6297579","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6314593","articleId":"6315608","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"AACC American Automatic Control Council)","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6315620,"authors":[{"name":"Kaarthik Sundar","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Texas A and M University, College Station, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Kaarthik","lastName":"Sundar","id":"38488687800"},{"name":"Sivakumar Rathinam","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Texas A and M University, College Station, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Sivakumar","lastName":"Rathinam","id":"37268809800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1096-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1095-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-1094-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2102-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2378-5861"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0743-1619"},{"format":"CD","value":"0743-1619"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"0743-1619"}],"articleNumber":"6315620","dbTime":"45 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":14,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":522},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6315620","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fuels","Vehicles","Heuristic algorithms","Approximation algorithms","Equations","Routing","Approximation methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["autonomous aerial vehicles","fuel","integer programming","linear programming"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["route planning algorithms","unmanned aerial vehicles","refueling constraints","small UAV","monitoring applications","target monitoring","UAV routing problem","multiple depots","fuel constraint","mixed integer-linear programming formulation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Traveling Salesman Problem","Orienteering Problem","Fuel Constraints","Local Search Heuristics","k-opt"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ACC.2012.6315620","publicationTitle":"2012 American Control Conference (ACC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 American Control Conference (ACC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6297579/6314593/06315620.pdf","startPage":"3266","endPage":"3271","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACC.2012.6315620","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6314593","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Route planning algorithms for unmanned aerial vehicles with refueling constraints","abstract":"Small UAVs are currently used in several monitoring applications to monitor a set of targets and collect relevant data. One of the main constraints that characterize a small UAV is the maximum amount of fuel the vehicle carry. In this article, we consider a single UAV routing problem where there are multiple depots and the vehicle is allowed to refuel at any depot. The objective of the problem is to find a path for the UAV such that each target is visited at least once by the vehicle, the fuel constraint is never violated along the path for the UAV, and the total cost of the edges present in the path is a minimum. We first develop a mixed integer, linear programming formulation to solve the problem optimally. We also propose fast and efficient construction and improvement heuristics to solve the same. Computational results are also presented to corroborate the solution quality and the running times of all the algorithms.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 June 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6315620/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"13036587","publicationDate":"June 2012","conferenceDate":"27-29 June 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6315620/","dateOfInsertion":"02 October 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Route planning algorithms for unmanned aerial vehicles with refueling constraints","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Route planning algorithms for unmanned aerial vehicles with refueling constraints","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"1984.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.081663S","chronDate":"27-29 June 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6297579","isNumber":"6314593","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6297579","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"6314593","articleId":"6315620","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"AACC American Automatic Control Council)","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6315630,"authors":[{"name":"Hossam S.

Since today's semi-autonomous systems perform threat assessment by predicting the vehicle's future state while treating the driver's input as a disturbance, controller intervention is limited to just emergency maneuvers. In order to improve vehicle safety and reduce the aggressiveness of maneuvers, threat assessment must occur over longer prediction horizons where driver's behavior cannot be neglected. We propose a framework that divides the problem of semi-autonomous control into two components. The first component reliably predicts the vehicle's potential behavior by using empirical observations of the driver's pose. The second component determines when the semi-autonomous controller should intervene. To quantitatively measure the performance of the proposed approach, we define metrics to evaluate the infor-mativeness of the prediction and the utility of the intervention procedure. A multi-subject driving experiment illustrates the usefulness, with respect to these metrics, of incorporating the driver's pose while designing a semi-autonomous system.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 June 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6315654/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"13036621","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6315654/","publicationDate":"June 2012","dateOfInsertion":"02 October 2012","conferenceDate":"27-29 June 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Safe semi-autonomous control with enhanced driver modeling","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Safe semi-autonomous control with enhanced driver modeling","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"2035.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.115352S","chronDate":"27-29 June 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6297579","isNumber":"6314593","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6297579","citationCount":"42","xplore-issue":"6314593","articleId":"6315654","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"AACC American Automatic Control Council","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":6315670,"authors":[{"name":"A.

These resources are flexible: they require delivery of a certain total energy over a specified service interval. This flexibility can facilitate the integration of renewable generation by absorbing variability, and reducing the reserve capacity and reserve energy requirements. We first model the energy needs of these resources as tasks, parameterized by arrival time, departure time, energy requirement, and maximum allowable servicing power. We consider the problem of servicing these resources by allocating available power using real-time scheduling policies. The available generation consists of a mix of renewable energy [from utility-scale wind-farms or distributed rooftop photovoltaics], and load-following reserves. Reserve capacity is purchased in advance, but reserve energy use must be scheduled in real-time to meet the energy requirements of the resources. We show that there does not exist a causal optimal scheduling policy that respects servicing power constraints. We then present three heuristic causal scheduling policies: Earliest Deadline First [EDF], Least Laxity First [LLF], and Receding Horizon Control [RHC].

We address the sensor arrangement problem, i.e. when and where sensors should take samples to obtain a good estimate of a field using mobile sensors. In particular, we focus on incidentally mobile sensors that move passively under the influence of the environment (e.g. sensors attached to floating buoys, cars and smartphones carried by humans). We model the field as a linear combination of known basis functions. Given the samples, we use a linear estimator to find unknown coefficients of the basis functions. We formulate the sensor arrangement problem as one of finding suitably characterized classes of sensor arrangements that lead to a stable reconstruction of the field. We consider a family of multidimensional \u03b4-dense sensor arrangements, where any square disc of size \u03b4 contains at least one sample, and derive sufficiency conditions for the arrangement to be stable. \u03b4-dense sensor arrangements are geometrically intuitive and are easily compatible with the incidental mobility of sensors in many situations. We present simulation results on the stability of such arrangements for two-dimensional basis functions. We also present an example for constructing basis functions through proper orthogonal decompositions for a one-dimensional chemical diffusion field in a heterogeneous medium, which are later used for field estimation through \u03b4-dense sampling.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6315677/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 June 2012","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"27-29 June 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6315677/","dateOfInsertion":"02 October 2012","publicationDate":"June 2012","accessionNumber":"13036644","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Stable arrangements of mobile sensors for sampling physical fields","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Stable arrangements of mobile sensors for sampling physical fields","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"2068.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.0724S","chronDate":"27-29 June 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6297579","isNumber":"6314593","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6297579","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6314593","articleId":"6315677","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"AACC American Automatic Control Council","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6315699,"authors":[{"name":"Peter Radecki","affiliation":["Sibley School of Mechanical and AeroSpace Engineering, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Peter","lastName":"Radecki","id":"38505359100"},{"name":"Brandon Hencey","affiliation":["Sibley School of Mechanical and AeroSpace Engineering, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Brandon","lastName":"Hencey","id":"37399263800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1096-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1095-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-1094-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2102-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2378-5861"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0743-1619"},{"format":"CD","value":"0743-1619"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"0743-1619"}],"articleNumber":"6315699","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":40,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1071},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6315699","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Buildings","Estimation","Kalman filters","Parameter estimation","Predictive models","Load modeling","Capacitance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["building management systems","Kalman filters","parameter estimation","structural engineering","thermal engineering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["online building thermal parameter estimation","unscented Kalman filtering","building thermal response","air conditioning system","energy conservation","weather responsive control system","prediction based control system","thermal model","online data driven system identification","parameter estimation routine","multizone thermal network","EnergyPlus simulation data","energy prediction","fault detection capability"]}],"abstract":"This study demonstrates how an Unscented Kalman Filter augmented for parameter estimation can accurately learn and predict a building's thermal response. Recent studies of buildings' heating, ventilating, and air-conditioning systems have shown 25% to 30% energy conservation is possible with advanced occupant and weather responsive control systems. Hindering the widespread deployment of such prediction-based control systems is an inability to readily acquire accurate, robust models of individual buildings' unique thermal envelope. Low-cost generation of these thermal models requires deployment of online data-driven system identification and parameter estimation routines. We propose a novel gray-box approach using an Unscented Kalman Filter based on a multi-zone thermal network and validate it with EnergyPlus simulation data. The filter quickly learns parameters of a thermal network during periods of known or constrained loads and then characterizes unknown loads in order to provide accurate 48+ hour energy predictions. Besides enabling advanced controllers, the model and predictions could provide useful analysis, monitoring, and fault detection capabilities.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6314593","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACC.2012.6315699","publicationTitle":"2012 American Control Conference (ACC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 American Control Conference (ACC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6297579/6314593/06315699.pdf","startPage":"3056","endPage":"3062","doi":"10.1109/ACC.2012.6315699","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Online building thermal parameter estimation via Unscented Kalman Filtering","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 June 2012","displayDocTitle":"Online building thermal parameter estimation via Unscented Kalman Filtering","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"27-29 June 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6315699/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2012","accessionNumber":"13036666","dateOfInsertion":"02 October 2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6315699/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Online building thermal parameter estimation via Unscented Kalman Filtering","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"2112.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.118356S","chronDate":"27-29 June 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6297579","isNumber":"6314593","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6297579","citationCount":"40","xplore-issue":"6314593","articleId":"6315699","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"AACC American Automatic Control Council","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6315769,"authors":[{"name":"Frank L.

Adaptive control [1], [2] and optimal control [3] represent different philosophies for designing feedback controllers. Optimal controllers are normally designed of ine by solving Hamilton JacobiBellman (HJB) equations, for example, the Riccati equation, using complete knowledge of the system dynamics. Determining optimal control policies for nonlinear systems requires the offline solution of nonlinear HJB equations, which are often difficult or impossible to solve. By contrast, adaptive controllers learn online to control unknown systems using data measured in real time along the system trajectories. Adaptive controllers are not usually designed to be optimal in the sense of minimizing user-prescribed performance functions. Indirect adaptive controllers use system identification techniques to first identify the system parameters and then use the obtained model to solve optimal design equations [1]. Adaptive controllers may satisfy certain inverse optimality conditions [4].","doi":"10.1109/MCS.2012.2214134","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6315752","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MCS.2012.2214134","publicationTitle":"IEEE Control Systems Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Control Systems Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel5/5488303/6315752/06315769.pdf","startPage":"76","endPage":"105","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reinforcement Learning and Feedback Control: Using Natural Decision Methods to Design Optimal Adaptive Controllers","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 November 2012","displayDocTitle":"Reinforcement Learning and Feedback Control: Using Natural Decision Methods to Design Optimal Adaptive Controllers","volume":"32","issue":"6","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2012","dateOfInsertion":"16 November 2012","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6315769/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","accessionNumber":"13115907","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6315769/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reinforcement Learning and Feedback Control: Using Natural Decision Methods to Design Optimal Adaptive Controllers","sourcePdf":"32mcs06-lewis-2214134-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.190838S","chronDate":"Dec.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"5488303","isNumber":"6315752","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5488303","citationCount":"446","xplore-issue":"6315752","articleId":"6315769","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-24"},{"_id":6315866,"authors":[{"name":"P.

In these emerging networks, a large number of femtocells are deployed within a macrocell. When a macrocell includes many femtocells, the number of handovers greatly increases because handover from the macrocell to the femtocell is executed frequently. However, frequent handovers increase overhead due to handover management as well as latency due to handover interruption. In this paper, we propose an efficient handover decision algorithm based on available data volume to reduce the unnecessary handovers and increase the throughput. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithm effectively reduces the number of unnecessary handovers while improving the throughput compared to a conventional RSS based algorithm.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Handover decision algorithm based on available data volume in hierarchical macro/femto-cell networks","publicationTitle":"2012 Fourth International Conference on Communications and Electronics (ICCE)","doi":"10.1109/CCE.2012.6315887","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 Fourth International Conference on Communications and Electronics (ICCE)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6307954/6315859/06315887.pdf","startPage":"145","endPage":"149","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCE.2012.6315887","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6315859","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6315887","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6315887/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 Aug. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Handover decision algorithm based on available data volume in hierarchical macro/femto-cell networks","conferenceDate":"1-3 Aug. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6315887/","dateOfInsertion":"02 October 2012","publicationDate":"Aug. 2012","accessionNumber":"13037227","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Handover decision algorithm based on available data volume in hierarchical macro/femto-cell networks","confLoc":"Hue, Vietnam","sourcePdf":"128145.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.086362S","chronDate":"1-3 Aug. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6307954","isNumber":"6315859","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6307954","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6315859","articleId":"6315887","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6315888,"authors":[{"name":"Vo Nguyen Quoc Bao","affiliation":["Telecommunication Department, Posts and Telecommunications Institute of Technology, Vietnam"],"firstName":"Vo Nguyen Quoc","lastName":"Bao","id":"37391822500"},{"name":"Bui Pham Lan Phuong","affiliation":["School of EE, Vietnam National University, Ho Chi Minh City International University, Vietnam"],"lastName":"Bui Pham Lan Phuong","id":"38488654500"},{"name":"Tran Thien Thanh","affiliation":["Faculty of EE, Ho Chi Minh City University of Transport, Vietnam"],"lastName":"Tran Thien Thanh","id":"38488553200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2493-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2492-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-2491-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6315888","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":251},"abstract":"We first propose transmit antenna selection/selection combining (TAS/SC) based MIMO decode-and-forward (DF) relaying networks to simultaneously employ advantages offered by multi-hop relaying and TAS/SC. To investigate the system, we further propose to approximate the distribution of the end-to-end signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). The advantage of the proposed approximation resides mainly in the fact that it results in simple and mathematically tractable closed-form expression of the system performance metrics such as outage probability, ergodic capacity, symbol error rate and bit error rate thus offering clear insights on system behaviors. Monte-Carlo simulation results have been performed to cross-check the accuracy of the theoretical analysis showing that our proposed protocol outperforms the single-antenna-equipped multi-hop network in all range of operating SNRs.

Therefore, the computational complexity of the SDR method is prohibitively high when the number of antennas is high. In this paper, we recast the MIMO relay beamforming problem as an optimization problem of spectral functions. As compared to previous SDR methods, our formulation significantly reduces the number of auxiliary variables while the optimal solutions are still achieved by an efficient iterative algorithm. Consequently, as shown by numerical simulations, our proposed method offers a lower computational time as compared to the SDR formulation.","doi":"10.1109/CCE.2012.6315889","publicationTitle":"2012 Fourth International Conference on Communications and Electronics (ICCE)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 Fourth International Conference on Communications and Electronics (ICCE)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6307954/6315859/06315889.pdf","startPage":"156","endPage":"160","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCE.2012.6315889","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6315859","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spectral optimization for beamforming in MIMO relay wireless networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6315889","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 Aug. 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6315889/","displayDocTitle":"Spectral optimization for beamforming in MIMO relay wireless networks","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2012","accessionNumber":"13037229","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6315889/","conferenceDate":"1-3 Aug. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"02 October 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spectral optimization for beamforming in MIMO relay wireless networks","confLoc":"Hue, Vietnam","sourcePdf":"130156.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.099639S","chronDate":"1-3 Aug. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6307954","isNumber":"6315859","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6307954","xplore-issue":"6315859","articleId":"6315889","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6315891,"authors":[{"name":"Sangho Nam","affiliation":["Mobile Technology 1 Team, 2nd Department, LG-ERICSSON, Anyang, Gyeonggi, South Korea"],"lastName":"Sangho Nam","id":"38488683500"},{"name":"Youngkwon Ryu","affiliation":["Mobile Technology 1 Team, 2nd Department, LG-ERICSSON, Anyang, Gyeonggi, South Korea"],"lastName":"Youngkwon Ryu","id":"38488671300"},{"name":"Seunghwan Lee","affiliation":["Mobile Technology 1 Team, 2nd Department, LG-ERICSSON, Anyang, Gyeonggi, South Korea"],"lastName":"Seunghwan Lee","id":"38488389400"},{"name":"Youngjo Lee","affiliation":["Mobile Technology 1 Team, 2nd Department, LG-ERICSSON, Anyang, Gyeonggi, South Korea"],"lastName":"Youngjo Lee","id":"37065383400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2493-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2492-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-2491-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6315891","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":137},"abstract":"In this paper, we propose a new group-based detector (GBD) to guarantee low complexity and high performance in multiple-input multiple-output systems.

The other detects the movement of termites hidden inside building materials at extremely short distances. Currently, our approach is moving away from classical radar towards Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) radar. This paper presents the sensor implementations and recent results. The aircraft radar is still a demonstration system, whilst the termite detector is a mature product.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6315892/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 Aug. 2012","conferenceDate":"1-3 Aug. 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6315892/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2012","accessionNumber":"13037232","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"02 October 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Radar imaging: Conventional and MIMO","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Radar imaging: Conventional and MIMO","confLoc":"Hue, Vietnam","sourcePdf":"133171.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067555S","chronDate":"1-3 Aug. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6307954","isNumber":"6315859","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6307954","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6315859","articleId":"6315892","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6315893,"authors":[{"name":"Mohammad Abu Hanif","affiliation":["Division of Electronics and Information Engineering, Chonbuk National University, Jeonju, Republic of Korea"],"firstName":"Mohammad Abu","lastName":"Hanif","id":"38490208000"},{"name":"Moon Ho Lee","affiliation":["Division of Electronics and Information Engineering, Chonbuk National University, Jeonju, Republic of Korea"],"firstName":"Moon Ho","lastName":"Lee","id":"37279700800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2493-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2492-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-2491-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6315893","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":254},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Channel estimation","Interpolation","Channel state information","Mean square error methods","Estimation","Interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","mean square error methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["two-way relay channel","pilot channel estimation","pilot based channel","estimation error","two-way relay networks","channel state information","CSI","minimum mean-square error","MMSE channel estimation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Channel Capacity","two-way relay channel","LS","MMSE","MIMO","Channel Estimation"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we calculate the capacity region of a pilot based channel with estimation error in two-way relay networks.

In each broadcast phase, the relay station does not decode streaming data from all nodes and apply beamforming scheme to its received data before sending to all nodes. Because the degree-of-freedom condition is not satisfied, the popular beamforming schemes like Zero Forcing and Minimization of Mean Square Error are not applicable.

One of the main drawbacks of the adoption of these optimizers in the design of a real system is the difficulty in the introduction, in the optimized design algorithm, of all the heuristic knowledge already available in the field. In order to overcome this problem compact genetic algorithms, classified as estimation of distribution algorithm, could be very effective, since they apply and manipulate a suitable probability vector to represent the distribution of good solutions. Unfortunately, their straightforward implementations usually lack of exploration, and they are easily trapped in local maxima. In order to overcome even this drawback and to develop a compact genetic algorithm with both the required exploitation, of the heuristic knowledge, and the exploration, for avoiding local maxima, in this paper a modified cGA is proposed by implementing more probability vectors and adding a suitable learning scheme to the traditional one in order to ensure the effectiveness of the algorithm. The here proposed new algorithm has been tested on some mathematical test functions and on a typical EM design problem, a microwave microstrip filter synthesis.","doi":"10.1109/CCE.2012.6315935","startPage":"389","endPage":"392","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 Fourth International Conference on Communications and Electronics (ICCE)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6307954/6315859/06315935.pdf","publicationTitle":"2012 Fourth International Conference on Communications and Electronics (ICCE)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCE.2012.6315935","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6315859","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improved compact genetic algorithm for EM complex system design","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Genetic algorithms","Vectors","Sociology","Statistics","Microwave filters","Algorithm design and analysis","Band pass filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electromagnetic waves","genetic algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compact genetic algorithm","EM complex system design","electromagnetic systems","probability vector","local maxima","modified cGA","EM design problem","mathematical test functions","microwave microstrip filter synthesis"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["compact genetic algorithm"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6315935/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 Aug. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Improved compact genetic algorithm for EM complex system design","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6315935/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"02 October 2012","conferenceDate":"1-3 Aug. 2012","accessionNumber":"13037275","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improved compact genetic algorithm for EM complex system design","confLoc":"Hue, Vietnam","sourcePdf":"505389.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06528S","chronDate":"1-3 Aug. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6307954","isNumber":"6315859","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6307954","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6315859","articleId":"6315935","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6315941,"authors":[{"name":"Bui Van Ha","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Energia, Politecnico di Milano, Milano, Italy"],"lastName":"Bui Van Ha","id":"37991290500"},{"name":"P.

In practice, during any one given period of time, when the desired BS performs downlink transmission with a specific MIMO mode, each co-channel interfering BS will use a MIMO mode the same as or different from that used in the desired link and any two co-channel interfering BSs may use different MIMO modes, so that the interference scenario becomes quite complicated. In this paper, considering realistic propagation conditions including both path-loss and Rayleigh fading and considering the existence of unequal-power interferers, the statistical distributions of the post-processing signal-to-interference ratios (SIRs) for either MBF or STBC downlink transmissions are analyzed when co-channel interfering BSs employ arbitrary MIMO modes. In particular, closed-form expressions for the probability density function (PDF) of the interference terms in the post-processing SIRs are derived. Further, the statistical distributions of the post-processing SIRs are analyzed. Simulation results verify the validity of the theoretical analyses.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/6331703/06315969.pdf","startPage":"2926","endPage":"2937","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2012.091712.110634","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2012.091712.110634","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6331703","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6315969","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Statistical Performance Analysis for MIMO Beamforming and STBC when Co-Channel Interferers Use Arbitrary MIMO Modes","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Vectors","Interference","Statistical distributions","Transmitting antennas","Receiving antennas","Signal to noise ratio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","cochannel interference","MIMO communication","multiplexing","Rayleigh channels","space-time block codes","statistical distributions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["statistical performance analysis","MIMO beamforming","space-time block coding","STBC","cochannel interferers","multiple input multiple output mode","MIMO modes","base station","open loop spatial multiplexing","OLSM","closed loop spatial multiplexing","CLSM","maximal ratio transmission","MRT","downlink transmission","interference scenario","realistic propagation conditions","path loss","Rayleigh fading","unequal power interferers","signal-to-interference ratio","probability density function","statistical distributions"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MIMO","MIMO beamforming","space-time block coding","co-channel interferers with mixed MIMO modes","post-processing SIR","statistical distribution."]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6315969/","chronOrPublicationDate":"October  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 September 2012","displayDocTitle":"Statistical Performance Analysis for MIMO Beamforming and STBC when Co-Channel Interferers Use Arbitrary MIMO Modes","volume":"60","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/6315969/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"October 2012","accessionNumber":"13056957","dateOfInsertion":"16 October 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Statistical Performance Analysis for MIMO Beamforming and STBC when Co-Channel Interferers Use Arbitrary MIMO Modes","sourcePdf":"2926-tc1210-zhang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.113871S","chronDate":"October  2012","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"6331703","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"6331703","articleId":"6315969","onlineDate":"28 September 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6315970,"authors":[{"name":"Kevin Chang","affiliation":["School of Engineering Systems, Queensland University of Technology, Brisbane, QLD, Australia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/6389884/6315970/6315970-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Kevin Chang received his BEng (Telecommunications) from Queensland University of Technology (QUT), Brisbane, Australia in 2008 with First Class Honours.

Dynamic primary user traffic is modelled as a random process, where the primary user changes states during both the sensing period and transmission period to reflect a more realistic scenario. Furthermore, we formulate joint constraints to correctly reflect interference to the primary user and lost opportunity of the secondary user during the transmission period. Finally, we implement a novel duty cycle based detector that is optimised with respect to PU traffic to accurately detect primary user activity during the sensing period. Simulation results show that unlike currently used detection models, the proposed algorithm can jointly optimise the sensing and transmission durations to simultaneously satisfy the optimisation constraints for the considered primary user traffic.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"December  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6315970/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 September 2012","volume":"60","issue":"12","accessionNumber":"13188498","publicationDate":"December 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6315970/","dateOfInsertion":"21 December 2012","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Spectrum Sensing Optimisation for Dynamic Primary User Signal","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spectrum Sensing Optimisation for Dynamic Primary User Signal","sourcePdf":"3632-tc1212-chang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.074822S","chronDate":"December  2012","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"6389884","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"6389884","articleId":"6315970","onlineDate":"28 September 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6315971,"authors":[{"name":"Yang Li","affiliation":["University of Texas, Dallas, Richardson, TX, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/6451308/6315971/6315971-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yang Li (S'10) received his B.S. and M.S. degree in electrical engineering from Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China in 2005 and 2008, respectively.

We propose a distributed relay selection and clustering framework, obtain closed-form expressions for the secondary rate, and show that secondary rate increases proportionally to log n. Remarkably, this is on the same order as the growth rate obtained in the absence of a primary system and its imposed constraints. Our results show that to maximize the rate, the secondary relays must transmit with power proportional to n\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">-1</sup>\n (thus the sum of relay powers is bounded) and also that the secondary source may not operate at its maximum allowable power. The tradeoff between the secondary rate and the interference on the primary is also characterized, showing that the primary interference can be reduced asymptotically to zero as n increases, while still maintaining a secondary rate that grows proportionally to log n. Finally, to address the rate loss due to half-duplex relaying in the secondary, we propose an alternating relay protocol and investigate its performance.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2012.091912.120062","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/6451308/06315971.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2012.091912.120062","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6451308","startPage":"53","endPage":"62","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spectrum Sharing with Distributed Relay Selection and Clustering","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6315971","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Spectrum Sharing with Distributed Relay Selection and Clustering","chronOrPublicationDate":"January  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6315971/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 September 2012","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"61","issue":"1","publicationDate":"January 2013","accessionNumber":"13287987","dateOfInsertion":"06 February 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6315971/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spectrum Sharing with Distributed Relay Selection and Clustering","sourcePdf":"053-tc1301-li.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.104955S","chronDate":"January  2013","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"6451308","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"6451308","articleId":"6315971","onlineDate":"28 September 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6315972,"authors":[{"name":"Shin-Pin Tseng","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, National United University, Miaoli, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/6362326/6315972/6315972-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Shin-Pin Tseng received the B.S. degree in electronic engineering from National Taipei University of Technology, Taipei, Taiwan and the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan, in 2001 and 2003, respectively.

A key technical challenge is overcoming artifacts from motion in order to produce ECG signals capable of being used in clinical diagnosis by a cardiologist. An electrode-tissue impedance is a signal of significant interest in reducing the motion artifact in ECG recordings on the go. A wireless system containing an ultralow-power analog front-end ECG signal acquisition, as well as the electrode-tissue impedance, is used in a validation study on multiple subjects. The goal of this paper is to study the correlation between motion artifacts and skin electrode impedance for a variety of motion types and electrodes. We have found that the correlation of the electrode-tissue impedance with the motion artifact is highly dependent on the electrode design the impedance signal (real, imaginary, absolute impedance), and artifact types (e.g., push or pull electrodes). With the chosen electrodes, we found that the highest correlation was obtained for local electrode artifacts (push, pull, electrode) followed by local skin (stretch, twist, skin) and global artifacts (walk, jog, jump). The results show that the electrode-tissue impedance can correlate with the motion artifacts for local disturbance of the electrodes and that the impedance signals can be used in motion artifact removal techniques such as adaptive filtering.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Electrocardiography","Impedance","Electrodes","Skin","Impedance measurement","Correlation","Current measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomedical electrodes","biomedical electronics","electrocardiography","gait analysis","health care","low-pass filters","medical signal detection","medical signal processing","skin"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electrode-tissue impedance signal","motion artifact removal method","biopotential recordings","ambulatory monitoring","electrocardiogram","personal healthcare","clinical diagnosis","cardiologist","ECG recordings","wireless system","ultralow-power analog front-end ECG signal acquisition","electrode design","impedance signal","push electrodes","pull electrodes","skin","stretch","twist","global artifacts","walk","jog","jump","adaptive filtering","low-pass filters"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Correlation","electrocardiogram","electrode-tissue impedance","motion artifact"]}],"doi":"10.1109/JSEN.2012.2221163","publicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","pdfPath":"/iel5/7361/6331614/06316054.pdf","startPage":"3373","endPage":"3383","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6331614","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSEN.2012.2221163","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Correlation Between Electrode-Tissue Impedance and Motion Artifact in Biopotential Recordings","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6316054","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Correlation Between Electrode-Tissue Impedance and Motion Artifact in Biopotential Recordings","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6316054/","volume":"12","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6316054/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"13128509","dateOfInsertion":"19 November 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 September 2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Correlation Between Electrode-Tissue Impedance and Motion Artifact in Biopotential Recordings","sourcePdf":"jsen-buxi-2221163-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.106035S","chronDate":"Dec.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"7361","isNumber":"6331614","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7361","citationCount":"46","xplore-issue":"6331614","articleId":"6316054","onlineDate":"28 September 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6316061,"authors":[{"name":"Takuji Miki","affiliation":["Panasonic Corporation, Osaka, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/6339059/6316061/6316061-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Takuji Miki (M'05) was born in Kyoto, Japan, in 1981.

DDR4 SDRAM is developed to raise memory bandwidth with lower power consumption compared with DDR3 SDRAM. Various functions and circuit techniques are newly adopted to reduce power consumption and secure stable transaction. First, dual error detection scheme is proposed to guarantee the reliability of signals. It is composed of cyclic redundancy check (CRC) for DQ channel and command-address (CA) parity for command and address channel. For stable reception of high speed signals, a gain enhanced buffer and PVT tolerant data fetch scheme are adopted for CA and DQ respectively. To reduce the output jitter, the type of delay line is selected depending on data rate at initial stage. As a result, test measurement shows 3.3 Gb/s DDR operation at 1.14 V.","doi":"10.1109/JSSC.2012.2213512","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6399535","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSSC.2012.2213512","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel5/4/6399535/06316063.pdf","startPage":"168","endPage":"177","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 1.2 V 30 nm 3.2 Gb/s/pin 4 Gb DDR4 SDRAM With Dual-Error Detection and PVT-Tolerant Data-Fetch Scheme","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 September 2012","displayDocTitle":"A 1.2 V 30 nm 3.2 Gb/s/pin 4 Gb DDR4 SDRAM With Dual-Error Detection and PVT-Tolerant Data-Fetch Scheme","volume":"48","issue":"1","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2013","dateOfInsertion":"04 January 2013","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6316063/","publicationDate":"Jan. 2013","accessionNumber":"13191441","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6316063/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 1.2 V 30 nm 3.2 Gb/s/pin 4 Gb DDR4 SDRAM With Dual-Error Detection and PVT-Tolerant Data-Fetch Scheme","sourcePdf":"jssc-sohn-2213512-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.090124S","chronDate":"Jan.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"4","isNumber":"6399535","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"6399535","articleId":"6316063","onlineDate":"28 September 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6316068,"authors":[{"name":"Daulet Askarov","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, E.

From a practical point of view, localization in 2D is sufficient for many applications, requiring much less calculations than in 3D, making it more robust and easier to implement in real-time low power applications. The low frequency magnetic field may penetrate foliage, soil, buildings, and many other types of media. This is an important advantage over traditional localization methods such as sonar or radar, where effective operation requires line-of-sight. Another advantage of the low frequency magnetic fields is that there is no direct influence by bad weather conditions and diurnal variations. Opposite to traditional electromagnetic methods, where operational range is usually more than a wavelength, low frequency induction approach results in a relatively limited localization range. Each beacon comprises a coil generating a magnetic field of a unique frequency in the ULF band. The generated magnetic fields are sensed by a search-coil magnetometer. The magnetometer readings are processed to estimate the magnitude and phase of the received beacons signals, which are used to localize the magnetometer. For a moving object, we propose to combine localization together with tracking algorithm using a data fusion approach. The proposed methods have been tested using numerous computer simulations, showing accurate localization results. A prototype was developed and used in field experiments, validating simulation results. The good accuracy together with a simple implementation makes the proposed methods attractive to many real-time low power field applications.","doi":"10.1109/JSTARS.2012.2213240","pdfPath":"/iel5/4609443/6516028/06316084.pdf","startPage":"1020","endPage":"1030","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSTARS.2012.2213240","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6516028","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Localization in 2D Using Beacons of Low Frequency Magnetic Field","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6316084/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 September 2012","displayDocTitle":"Localization in 2D Using Beacons of Low Frequency Magnetic Field","volume":"6","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"14 May 2013","accessionNumber":"13499689","publicationDate":"April 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6316084/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Localization in 2D Using Beacons of Low Frequency Magnetic Field","sourcePdf":"jstars-sheinker-2213240-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.10623S","chronDate":"April  2013","xplore-pub-id":"4609443","isNumber":"6516028","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4609443","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"6516028","articleId":"6316084","onlineDate":"28 September 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6316087,"authors":[{"name":"Jing Hou","affiliation":["College of Information Science and Engineering, Northeastern University, Shenyang, China","School of Information and Control Engineering, Shenyang Jianzhu University, Shenyang, China","State Key Laboratory of Robotics, Shenyang Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shenyang, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8856/6493467/6316087/6316087-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jing Hou received the B.S. degree and the M.S. degrees from Shenyang Jianzhu University, Shenyang, China, in 2001 and 2004, respectively.

For example, the AFM tip tends to slip-away during nanoparticle manipulation due to its small touch area, and there is no available strategy to manipulate a nanorod in a constant posture with a single tip since the applied point force can make the nanorod rotate more easily. In this paper, a robotic nano-hand method is proposed to solve these problems. The basic idea is using a single tip to mimic the manipulation effect that multi-AFM tip can achieve through the planned high speed sequential tip pushing. The theoretical behavior models of nanoparticle and nanorod are developed, based on which the moving speed and trajectory of the AFM tip are planned artfully to form a nano-hand. In this way, the slip-away problem during nanoparticle manipulation can be get rid of efficiently, and a posture constant manipulation for nanorod can be achieved. The simulation and experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed method.","doi":"10.1109/TASE.2012.2215853","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/8856/6493467/06316087.pdf","startPage":"285","endPage":"295","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TASE.2012.2215853","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6493467","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"AFM-Based Robotic Nano-Hand for Stable Manipulation at Nanoscale","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6316087","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 September 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6316087/","displayDocTitle":"AFM-Based Robotic Nano-Hand for Stable Manipulation at Nanoscale","volume":"10","issue":"2","publicationDate":"April 2013","accessionNumber":"13413123","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6316087/","dateOfInsertion":"03 April 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"AFM-Based Robotic Nano-Hand for Stable Manipulation at Nanoscale","sourcePdf":"tase-hou-2215853-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.069113S","chronDate":"April  2013","xplore-pub-id":"8856","isNumber":"6493467","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8856","citationCount":"42","xplore-issue":"6493467","articleId":"6316087","onlineDate":"28 September 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-02"},{"_id":6316094,"authors":[{"name":"Jong Cheol Baeg","affiliation":["Department of Biomedical Engineering, College of Electronics and Information, Kyung Hee University, Yongin, Gyeonggi, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4156126/6518158/6316094/6316094-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jong Cheol Baeg (S'12) received the B.S. and M.Eng. degrees in electrical engineering from the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), Yuseong-gu, Daejeon, in 1992 and 1994, respectively.","Since 2010, he has been working toward the Ph.D degree at Kyung Hee University, Yongin-si, Gyeonggi-do, Korea. from 1994 to 1999, he worked for Hyundai Electronics designing car electronic control units. from 2000 to 2002, he worked with DSP applications for Texas Instruments Incorporated.

The setup uses two high performance comparators to convert amplitude difference to a timing difference. This is captured by a high speed microprocessor. A straightforward algorithm removes DC and timing offsets.

We use most-significant-1 bit detection technique for micro-rotation sequence generation to reduce the number of iterations. By storing the sinh/cosh hyperbolic values at octant boundaries in a ROM, we can extend the range of convergence to the entire coordinate space. Based on this, we propose a pipeline hyperbolic CORDIC processor to implement a direct digital synthesizer (DDS). The DDS is further used to derive an efficient arbitrary waveform generator (AWG), where a pseudo-random number generator modulates the linear increments of phase to produce random phase-modulated waveform. The proposed waveform generator requires only one DDS for generating variety of modulated waveforms, while existing designs require separate DDS units for different type of waveforms, and multiple DDS units are required to generate composite waveforms. Therefore, area complexity of existing designs gets multiplied with the number of different types waveforms they generate, while in case of proposed design that remains unchanged. The proposed AWG when mapped on Xilinx Spartan 2E device, consumes 1076 slices and 2016 4-input LUTs. The proposed AWG involves significantly less area and lower latency, with nearly the same throughput compared to the existing CORDIC-based designs.","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2012.2215778","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2012.2215778","startPage":"314","endPage":"326","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel5/8919/6419840/06316097.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6419840","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Scale-Free Hyperbolic CORDIC Processor and Its Application to Waveform Generation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6316097/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 September 2012","displayDocTitle":"Scale-Free Hyperbolic CORDIC Processor and Its Application to Waveform Generation","volume":"60","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"24 January 2013","accessionNumber":"13256728","publicationDate":"Feb. 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6316097/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Scale-Free Hyperbolic CORDIC Processor and Its Application to Waveform Generation","sourcePdf":"tcsi-aggarwal-2215778-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.11794S","chronDate":"Feb.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"6419840","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"6419840","articleId":"6316097","onlineDate":"28 September 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6316101,"authors":[{"name":"Florian Dorfler","affiliation":["Center for Control, Dynamical Systems and Computation, University of California at Santa Barbara, Santa Barbara, CA, United States"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/6403532/6316101/6316101-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Florian D\u00f6rfler received his Diplom degree in Engineering Cybernetics from the University of Stuttgart, Germany, in 2008.

The Kron reduction of this graph is again a graph whose Laplacian matrix is obtained by the Schur complement of the original Laplacian matrix with respect to a specified subset of nodes. The Kron reduction process is ubiquitous in classic circuit theory and in related disciplines such as electrical impedance tomography, smart grid monitoring, transient stability assessment, and analysis of power electronics. Kron reduction is also relevant in other physical domains, in computational applications, and in the reduction of Markov chains. Related concepts have also been studied as purely theoretic problems in the literature on linear algebra. In this paper we analyze the Kron reduction process from the viewpoint of algebraic graph theory. Specifically, we provide a comprehensive and detailed graph-theoretic analysis of Kron reduction encompassing topological, algebraic, spectral, resistive, and sensitivity analyses. Throughout our theoretic elaborations we especially emphasize the practical applicability of our results to various problem setups arising in engineering, computation, and linear algebra. Our analysis of Kron reduction leads to novel insights both on the mathematical and the physical side.","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2012.2215780","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6403532","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2012.2215780","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel5/8919/6403532/06316101.pdf","startPage":"150","endPage":"163","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Kron Reduction of Graphs With Applications to Electrical Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 September 2012","displayDocTitle":"Kron Reduction of Graphs With Applications to Electrical Networks","volume":"60","issue":"1","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2013","dateOfInsertion":"04 January 2013","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6316101/","publicationDate":"Jan. 2013","accessionNumber":"13196193","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6316101/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Kron Reduction of Graphs With Applications to Electrical Networks","sourcePdf":"tcsi-dorfler-2215780-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.143205S","chronDate":"Jan.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"6403532","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"332","xplore-issue":"6403532","articleId":"6316101","onlineDate":"28 September 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6316102,"authors":[{"name":"Weidong Kuang","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, University of Texas-Pan American, Edinburg, TX, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/6486561/6316102/6316102-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Weidong Kuang received the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from the University of Central Florida, Orlando, in 2003.","Since August 2004, he has been with the Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Texas-Pan American, Edinburg, where he is currently an Associate Professor.

For highly nonlinear PAs, the proposed model offers some benefits, such as a low dispersion of coefficients, numerical stability and a low number of coefficients.

The microgrid would utilize the local DER as well as the main grid for supplying its hourly load economically which is subject to power quality and reliability requirements. The HRDS implemented at Illinois Institute of Technology (IIT) is used as a case study along with the local DER to increase the load point reliability and decrease the operation cost of the IIT microgrid. The availability of distribution lines, main grid supply, and microgrid generation is considered using the Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation in the microgrid scenarios.

The application-specific instruction-set processor (ASIP) was implemented on field-programmable gate array and interfaced with a gyro-plus-accelerometer 6-D sensor and with a magnetic compass. Output data were recorded on a personal computer and also used to perform a live demo. During system modeling and design, it was chosen to represent angular position data with a quaternion and to use an extended Kalman filter as sensor fusion algorithm. For this purpose, a novel two-stage filter was designed: The first stage uses accelerometer data, and the second one uses magnetic compass data for angular position correction. This allows flexibility, less computational requirements, and robustness to magnetic field anomalies. The final goal of this work is to realize an upgraded application-specified integrated circuit that controls the microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) sensor and integrates the ASIP. This will allow the MEMS sensor gyro plus accelerometer and the angular estimation system to be contained in a single package; this system might optionally work with an external magnetic compass.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","pdfPath":"/iel5/19/6450120/06316172.pdf","startPage":"590","endPage":"598","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","doi":"10.1109/TIM.2012.2218692","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIM.2012.2218692","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6450120","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6316172","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Double-Stage Kalman Filter for Orientation Tracking With an Integrated Processor in 9-D IMU","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Kalman filters","Accelerometers","Quaternions","Estimation","Covariance matrix","Mathematical model","Noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["accelerometers","application specific integrated circuits","compasses","computerised instrumentation","data acquisition","field programmable gate arrays","gyroscopes","inertial systems","Kalman filters","magnetic sensors","microsensors","nonlinear filters","position measurement","sensor fusion"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["double-stage Kalman filter","orientation tracking","9-D IMU","application specific integrated processor","angular estimation system","9-D inertial measurement units","application specific instruction set processor","ASIP","field programmable gate array","gyro-plus-accelerometer 6-D sensor","personal computer","output data recording","system modeling","system design","angular position data representation","extended Kalman filter","sensor fusion algorithm","two-stage filter design","accelerometer data","angular position correction","magnetic compass data","magnetic field anomalies","application specific integrated circuit","microelectromechanical system sensor","MEMS sensor"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Angular position","application-specific instruction-set processor (ASIP)","inertial measurement unit (IMU)","Kalman filter","orientation tracking","quaternions","sensor fusion"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6316172/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 September 2012","displayDocTitle":"A Double-Stage Kalman Filter for Orientation Tracking With an Integrated Processor in 9-D IMU","volume":"62","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/6316172/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2013","accessionNumber":"13284815","dateOfInsertion":"05 February 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Double-Stage Kalman Filter for Orientation Tracking With an Integrated Processor in 9-D IMU","sourcePdf":"tim-sabatelli-2218692-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.103212S","chronDate":"March  2013","xplore-pub-id":"19","isNumber":"6450120","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"19","citationCount":"86","xplore-issue":"6450120","articleId":"6316172","onlineDate":"28 September 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":6316177,"authors":[{"name":"Christian Antfolk","affiliation":["Department of Measurement Technology and Industrial Electrical Engineering, Lund University, Lund, Sweden"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7333/6403583/6316177/6316177-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Christian Antfolk (S'08\u2013M'12) received the B.

It compares different sensory feedback modalities using an artificial hand prosthesis in: 1) a modality matched paradigm where pressure recorded on the five fingertips of the hand was fed back as pressure stimulation on five target points on the residual limb; and 2) a modality mismatched paradigm where the pressures were transformed into mechanical vibrations and fed back. Eight transradial amputees took part in the study and were divided in two groups based on the integrity of their phantom map; group A had a complete phantom map on the residual limb whereas group B had an incomplete or nonexisting map. The ability in localizing stimuli was compared with that of 10 healthy subjects using the vibration feedback and 11 healthy subjects using the pressure feedback (in a previous study), on their forearms, in similar experiments. Results demonstrate that pressure stimulation surpassed vibrotactile stimulation in multi-site sensory feedback discrimination. Furthermore, we demonstrate that subjects with a detailed phantom map had the best discrimination performance and even surpassed healthy participants for both feedback paradigms whereas group B had the worst performance overall. Finally, we show that placement of feedback devices on a complete phantom map improves multi-site sensory feedback discrimination, independently of the feedback modality.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6316177/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 September 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6316177/","dateOfInsertion":"04 January 2013","publicationDate":"Jan. 2013","accessionNumber":"13196125","pubMedId":"23033439","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"21","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Artificial Redirection of Sensation From Prosthetic Fingers to the Phantom Hand Map on Transradial Amputees: Vibrotactile Versus Mechanotactile Sensory Feedback","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Artificial Redirection of Sensation From Prosthetic Fingers to the Phantom Hand Map on Transradial Amputees: Vibrotactile Versus Mechanotactile Sensory Feedback","sourcePdf":"tnsre-antfolk-2217989-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.085461S","chronDate":"Jan.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"7333","isNumber":"6403583","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7333","citationCount":"107","xplore-issue":"6403583","articleId":"6316177","onlineDate":"28 September 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6316185,"authors":[{"name":"Joshua Schultz","affiliation":["George W.

Because the force available is often more than the required, the stroke of the piezoelectric stack can be amplified by a compliant mechanism at the expense of force. It is not always clear what the geometry of this compliant mechanism should be. Compliant mechanisms have parallels in biology in that they describe two-way interactions between the actuator and the environment. In this paper, we employ the concept of a two-port network model from circuit theory to describe this two-way interaction and present a method to obtain each element of the two-port model as an analytical function of physical geometric parameters for a wide class of geometries. This method makes use of Castigliano's theorem and Euler-Bernoulli linearly elastic beam theory. To our knowledge, this is the first two-port representation of a compliant mechanism that is based on analytical expressions of geometric parameters. This analytical model agrees well with finite-element method calculations. We also examine a representative case experimentally and achieve accuracies better than 18%.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Actuators","Strain","Manufacturing processes","Robots","Fasteners","Geometry","Muscles"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["circuit theory","compliant mechanisms","elasticity","finite element analysis","piezoelectric actuators","robot dynamics","two-port networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compliant rhomboidal strain amplifiers","two-port network model","piezoelectric stack actuators","zero backlash","compliant mechanism","two-way interactions","circuit theory","physical geometric parameters","Castigliano's theorem","Euler-Bernoulli linearly elastic beam theory","finite element method"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Mechanical engineering","piezoelectrical actuators","robots"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TRO.2012.2216392","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics","pdfPath":"/iel5/8860/6428720/06316185.pdf","startPage":"42","endPage":"54","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6428720","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TRO.2012.2216392","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Two-Port Network Models for Compliant Rhomboidal Strain Amplifiers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6316185","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Two-Port Network Models for Compliant Rhomboidal Strain Amplifiers","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6316185/","volume":"29","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Feb. 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6316185/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"13270786","dateOfInsertion":"01 February 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 September 2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Two-Port Network Models for Compliant Rhomboidal Strain Amplifiers","sourcePdf":"tro-schultz-2216392-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.066367S","chronDate":"Feb.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"8860","isNumber":"6428720","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8860","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"6428720","articleId":"6316185","onlineDate":"28 September 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6316187,"authors":[{"name":"Hyunil Yoo","affiliation":["Mobile Communications Laboratory, Chung-Ang University, Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Hyunil","lastName":"Yoo","id":"37400332200"},{"name":"Mina Lee","affiliation":["Mobile Communications Laboratory, Chung-Ang University, Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Mina","lastName":"Lee","id":"38490659000"},{"name":"Tae Howan Hong","affiliation":["Mobile Communications Laboratory, Chung-Ang University, Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Tae Howan","lastName":"Hong","id":"38667148100"},{"name":"Yong Soo Cho","affiliation":["Mobile Communications Laboratory, Chung-Ang University, Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Yong Soo","lastName":"Cho","id":"37290880800"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9545"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1939-9359"}],"articleNumber":"6316187","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":570},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Vehicular Technology Society","url":"http://www.vtsociety.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["IEEE 802.16 Standards","OFDM","Mesh networks","Physical layer","Frequency estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mobility management (mobile radio)","OFDM modulation","WiMax","wireless mesh networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["preamble design","IEEE 802.16 OFDM","mobile mesh network","hierarchical design","orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing","handover overhead reduction","intercluster handover event","intracluster handover event","scanning procedure","network entry procedure"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Handover","mobile mesh networks (MMNs)","preamble"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, a hierarchical design concept of a preamble for orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM)-based mobile mesh networks (MMNs) is proposed to reduce the handover overhead by distinguishing an intercluster handover event from an intracluster handover event at the physical layer.

Both an uncoded and a sophisticated near-capacity-coded OFDMA/SC-FDMA STSK scheme were studied, and their performances were compared in multiuser wideband multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) scenarios. Explicitly, OFDMA/SC-FDMA-aided STSK exhibits an excellent performance, even in the presence of channel impairments due to the frequency selectivity of wideband channels, and proves to be a beneficial choice for high-capacity multiuser MIMO systems.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2012.2220794","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/6410063/06316188.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2012.2220794","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6410063","startPage":"408","endPage":"414","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"OFDMA/SC-FDMA Aided Space\u2013Time Shift Keying for Dispersive Multiuser Scenarios","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6316188","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"OFDMA/SC-FDMA Aided Space\u2013Time Shift Keying for Dispersive Multiuser Scenarios","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6316188/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 September 2012","isJournal":true,"volume":"62","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2013","accessionNumber":"13219895","dateOfInsertion":"11 January 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"OFDMA/SC-FDMA Aided Space\u2013Time Shift Keying for Dispersive Multiuser Scenarios","sourcePdf":"tvt-hanzo-2220794-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.068807S","chronDate":"Jan.  2013","isNumber":"6410063","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"34","articleId":"6316188","onlineDate":"28 September 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6316189,"authors":[{"name":"Seung-Hyun Kong","affiliation":["CCS Graduate School for Green Transportation, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/6461155/6316189/6316189-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Seung-Hyun Kong (M\u201906) received the B.S.E.E. degree from Sogang University, Seoul, Korea, in 1992, the M.S.E.E. degree from Polytechnic University, Brooklyn, NY, in 1994, and the Ph.D. degree in aeronautics and astronautics from Stanford University, Stanford, CA, in 2006.","From 1997 to 2004, he was with Samsung Electronics Inc. and Nexpilot Inc., both in Korea, where his research focus was on Second-Generation Code-Division Multiple Access, Third-Generation Universal Mobile Telecommunication System PHY, and mobile positioning technologies.

Because GNSS uses direct-sequence spread spectrum (DSSS) signaling with binary phase-shift keying (BPSK) or with BPSK and binary offset carrier, any GNSS signal can have a sparse representation so that the concept of compressed sensing can be applied to detect GNSS signals. To achieve a fast acquisition of the GNSS signal with a reduced number of correlators and low computational complexity, we propose a two-stage deterministic compressed GNSS acquisition technique using the Walsh-Hadamard matrix. The proposed technique makes fast acquisition possible for a receiver using a much smaller number of correlators than the conventional parallel-correlator-based technique, which requires much less computational complexity than the FFT-based technique. We provide complexity analysis of the proposed technique and compare the statistical performance of the proposed technique with other techniques applicable to the fast GNSS acquisition. The proposed technique is easy to implement and is the first compressed-sensing-based GNSS acquisition technique.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2012.2220989","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/6461155/06316189.pdf","startPage":"511","endPage":"521","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2012.2220989","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6461155","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Deterministic Compressed GNSS Acquisition Technique","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6316189","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 September 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6316189/","displayDocTitle":"A Deterministic Compressed GNSS Acquisition Technique","volume":"62","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 2013","accessionNumber":"13307155","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6316189/","dateOfInsertion":"12 February 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Deterministic Compressed GNSS Acquisition Technique","sourcePdf":"tvt-kong-2220989-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.072375S","chronDate":"Feb.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"6461155","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"34","xplore-issue":"6461155","articleId":"6316189","onlineDate":"28 September 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6316193,"authors":[{"name":"Junrong Peng","affiliation":["State Key Lab of Digital Manufacturing Equipment & Technology, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Junrong","lastName":"Peng","id":"38542062800"},{"name":"Yunfei Zhou","affiliation":["State Key Lab of Digital Manufacturing Equipment & Technology, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Yunfei","lastName":"Zhou","id":"38123530400"},{"name":"Guangdou Liu","affiliation":["State Key Lab of Digital Manufacturing Equipment & Technology, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Guangdou","lastName":"Liu","id":"37086634736"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9464"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0069"}],"articleNumber":"6316193","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":19,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":473},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Magnetics Society","url":"http://www.ieeemagnetics.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Coils","Numerical models","Arrays","Planar motors","Force","Torque","Accuracy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["coils","electric motors","integration","machine control","magnetic levitation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["harmonic model","Newton-Leibniz formula","composite numerical integration","coil","corner segments","magnetically levitated ironless planar motor","real-time control model"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Coil","corner segments","planar motor","real-time control model"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents a new real-time control model for the magnetically levitated ironless planar motor.

Most grid-tie inverter manufacturers design these passive filters to eliminate high frequency current ripples and switching harmonics generated by the switching actions of inverters. Under high wind power penetration output power filters are susceptible to create severe resonance due to their interaction with the grid voltage harmonics and transmission line impedances. This resonance generates high harmonics which are not only not in compliance with the IEEE 519 power quality requirement, but also are very harmful to power system components. This paper proposes a hybrid damping approach which combines the passive damping of the filter with a physical resistor and an active damping of the inverter output harmonics with grid voltage harmonics feed-forward. The approach takes into account the passive filters interaction with the grid through impedance analysis under high wind power penetration. Simulations and field tests are shown to demonstrate the validity of the proposed approach.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power harmonic filters","Damping","Harmonic analysis","Passive filters","Wind farms","Wind turbines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feedforward","harmonics suppression","invertors","passive filters","power filters","power grids","power supply quality","power system stability","power transformers","power transmission lines","wind power plants"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["grid-tie inverter output harmonics","resonance rejection","wind park stability","pad-mount transformers","passive filters","PMT","grid-tie inverter manufacturer design","high frequency current ripple elimination","switching harmonics elimination","high wind power penetration output power filters","transmission line impedances","IEEE 519 power quality","power system components","hybrid damping approach","grid voltage harmonic feedforward","impedance analysis","high wind power penetration","physical resistor","active damping"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Active damping","passive filters","power system harmonics","voltage source converters","wind turbine"]}],"doi":"10.1109/PEMWA.2012.6316388","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE Power Electronics and Machines in Wind Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE Power Electronics and Machines in Wind Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/6304952/6316351/06316388.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6316351","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PEMWA.2012.6316388","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hybrid damping of grid-tie inverter output harmonics for resonance rejection & wind park stability under high penetration","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6316388","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Hybrid damping of grid-tie inverter output harmonics for resonance rejection & wind park stability under high penetration","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6316388/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6316388/","accessionNumber":"13036889","conferenceDate":"16-18 July 2012","dateOfInsertion":"02 October 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 July 2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hybrid damping of grid-tie inverter output harmonics for resonance rejection & wind park stability under high penetration","confLoc":"Denver, CO, USA","sourcePdf":"PEMWA2012049.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045381S","chronDate":"16-18 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6304952","isNumber":"6316351","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6304952","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6316351","articleId":"6316388","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6316400,"authors":[{"name":"Sang-Wook Sohn","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Texas, Austin, USA"],"firstName":"Sang-Wook","lastName":"Sohn","id":"37285929800"},{"name":"Alicia J.

Optimization of adders' speed, power, and area is a challenging task. To this end, redundant number system has been proposed in the literatures. In this paper, we propose a new redundant binary signed-digit adder that not only utilizes specific encoding for the input operands, but also uses a new efficient adder structure. Using this technique we can generate low power signed digit adders that perform fast additions. The comparisons show delay, power and area reduction both on FPGA and Synopsys Design Vision tool.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Adders","Encoding","Compressors","Delay","Field programmable gate arrays","Computer architecture","Standards"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adders","field programmable gate arrays","redundant number systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["addition operation","digital computation","adder speed","adder power","adder area","redundant number system","redundant binary signed-digit adder","input operand","adder structure","low power signed digit adder","FPGA","Synopsys Design Vision tool","field programmable gate array"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Redundant addition","binary signed digit number system","high-speed low-power arithmetic","FPGA","VLSI"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6316422","doi":"10.1109/CADS.2012.6316422","displayPublicationTitle":"The 16th CSI International Symposium on Computer Architecture and Digital Systems (CADS 2012)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6305328/6316409/06316422.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CADS.2012.6316422","startPage":"70","endPage":"74","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6316409","publicationTitle":"The 16th CSI International Symposium on Computer Architecture and Digital Systems (CADS 2012)","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel high-speed low-power binary signed-digit adder","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A novel high-speed low-power binary signed-digit adder","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6316422/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"2-3 May 2012","conferenceDate":"2-3 May 2012","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6316422/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"02 October 2012","publicationDate":"May 2012","accessionNumber":"13036938","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel high-speed low-power binary signed-digit adder","confLoc":"Shiraz, Iran","sourcePdf":"013.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055629S","chronDate":"2-3 May 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6305328","isNumber":"6316409","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6305328","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"6316409","articleId":"6316422","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":6316462,"authors":[{"name":"Hua Chen","affiliation":["Wireless Signal Processing and Network Laboratory, Key Laboratory of Universal Wireless Communication, Ministry of Education, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Hua","lastName":"Chen","id":"38067678200"},{"name":"Mugen Peng","affiliation":["Wireless Signal Processing and Network Laboratory, Key Laboratory of Universal Wireless Communication, Ministry of Education, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Mugen","lastName":"Peng","id":"37269684700"},{"name":"Jiamo Jiang","affiliation":["Wireless Signal Processing and Network Laboratory, Key Laboratory of Universal Wireless Communication, Ministry of Education, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jiamo","lastName":"Jiang","id":"38521006700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2997-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2996-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2995-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6316462","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":118},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Macrocell networks","Bandwidth","Resource management","OFDM","Analytical models","Signal to noise ratio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular arrays","cellular radio","frequency division multiple access","OFDM modulation","resource allocation","telecommunication channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["resource configuration scheme","OFDMA-based cellular relay networks","wireless cellular network","resource allocation","macrocell","relay cells","backhaul link","access link","co-channel sharing scenario","orthogonal sharing scenarios"]}],"abstract":"Relay has been considered by the wireless cellular network as a promising solution to increase system throughput and enlarge the cell coverage. In this paper, we investigate resource configuration in OFDMA-based cellular relay networks from two aspects. One focuses on the resource allocation between macrocell and relay cells, which ensures the serving fairness among users across the whole network. The other aims to balance the achieving capacity between backhaul link and access link, utilizing the resources in the most cost efficient way. Through applying these principles to orthogonal and co-channel sharing scenarios, analysis and performance evaluation are given to illustrate our proposed scheme. Furthermore, the co-channel sharing scenario is more recommended to be deployed in the practical communication system because the higher system spectrum efficiency can be realized.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A resource configuration scheme in OFDMA-based cellular relay networks","publicationTitle":"2012 1st IEEE International Conference on Communications in China Workshops (ICCC)","doi":"10.1109/ICCCW.2012.6316462","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 1st IEEE International Conference on Communications in China Workshops (ICCC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6308764/6316453/06316462.pdf","startPage":"102","endPage":"107","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCCW.2012.6316462","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6316453","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6316462","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6316462/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 Aug. 2012","displayDocTitle":"A resource configuration scheme in OFDMA-based cellular relay networks","conferenceDate":"15-17 Aug. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6316462/","dateOfInsertion":"02 October 2012","publicationDate":"Aug. 2012","accessionNumber":"13035546","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A resource configuration scheme in OFDMA-based cellular relay networks","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"p102chen.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055098S","chronDate":"15-17 Aug. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6308764","isNumber":"6316453","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6308764","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6316453","articleId":"6316462","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6316465,"authors":[{"name":"Qian Wen","affiliation":["Department of Information Science and Electronic Engineering, University of Zhejiang, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Qian","lastName":"Wen","id":"38488396300"},{"name":"Zhifeng Zhao","affiliation":["Department of Information Science and Electronic Engineering, University of Zhejiang, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Zhifeng","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37405537800"},{"name":"Rongpeng Li","affiliation":["Department of Information Science and Electronic Engineering, University of Zhejiang, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Rongpeng","lastName":"Li","id":"38517911000"},{"name":"Honggang Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Information Science and Electronic Engineering, University of Zhejiang, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Honggang","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37280788800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2997-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2996-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2995-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6316465","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":353},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Load modeling","Compressed sensing","Predictive models","Vectors","Matrix decomposition","Mobile communication","Base stations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","matrix decomposition","quality of service","signal reconstruction","telecommunication traffic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["spatial-temporal compressed sensing","traffic prediction","cellular networks","base stations","BS","power consumption","QoS","quality-of-service","mobile cellular user","adaptive energy resource allocation","network cooperation","TM","traffic matrix factorization"]}],"abstract":"In conventional cellular networks, base stations (B-Ss) usually suffer from severe power consumption since they are working to guarantee the coverage and QoS (quality-of-service) requirement according to the peak traffic load generated by the mobile cellular users Accordingly, how to precisely forecast the future traffic load to promote network cooperation and adaptive energy resource allocation in complying with the variation of spatial-temporal traffic load has been an emerged issue due to the significant energy exhaustion of BSs. In this paper, we propose a spatial-temporal compressed sensing based network traffic prediction method to solve this problem. We first construct a traffic matrix (TM) by using previously measured data and setting the data to be predicted as zeros, corresponding to the volume of traffic load. Then, compressed sensing approach with large scale and small scale temporal constraints as well as spatial constraints is employed to factorize the traffic matrix. By reuniting the results of traffic matrix factorization, we obtain the estimation of predicted traffic data. Numerical results have showed that this method can restrict the prediction error under 10% when dealing with real traffic load data.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spatial-temporal compressed sensing based traffic prediction in cellular networks","publicationTitle":"2012 1st IEEE International Conference on Communications in China Workshops (ICCC)","doi":"10.1109/ICCCW.2012.6316465","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 1st IEEE International Conference on Communications in China Workshops (ICCC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6308764/6316453/06316465.pdf","startPage":"119","endPage":"124","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCCW.2012.6316465","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6316453","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6316465","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6316465/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 Aug. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Spatial-temporal compressed sensing based traffic prediction in cellular networks","conferenceDate":"15-17 Aug. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6316465/","dateOfInsertion":"02 October 2012","publicationDate":"Aug. 2012","accessionNumber":"13035549","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spatial-temporal compressed sensing based traffic prediction in cellular networks","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"p119wen.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071373S","chronDate":"15-17 Aug. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6308764","isNumber":"6316453","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6308764","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6316453","articleId":"6316465","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6316466,"authors":[{"name":"Zohreh Sanaei","affiliation":["Mobile Cloud Computing Research Laboratory, Faculty of Computer Science and Information Technology, University of Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Zohreh","lastName":"Sanaei","id":"38488776600"},{"name":"Saeid Abolfazli","affiliation":["Mobile Cloud Computing Research Laboratory, Faculty of Computer Science and Information Technology, University of Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Saeid","lastName":"Abolfazli","id":"38488502500"},{"name":"Abdullah Gani","affiliation":["Mobile Cloud Computing Research Laboratory, Faculty of Computer Science and Information Technology, University of Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Abdullah","lastName":"Gani","id":"37682537100"},{"name":"Muhammad Shiraz","affiliation":["Mobile Cloud Computing Research Laboratory, Faculty of Computer Science and Information Technology, University of Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Muhammad","lastName":"Shiraz","id":"38488623600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2997-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2996-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2995-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6316466","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":45,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":735},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Mobile communication","Cloud computing","Computer architecture","Mobile handsets","Service oriented architecture","Mobile computing","Security"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","mobile computing","pattern classification","resource allocation","service-oriented architecture"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["SAMI","service-based arbitrated multitier infrastructure","mobile cloud computing technology","MCC","mobile devices","long-WAN latency","trust","service oriented architecture","SOA","arbitrator layer","mobile network operators","MNO authorized dealers","service classification","resource allocation","service-based platform-neutral mobile applications"]}],"abstract":"Mobile Cloud Computing (MCC) is the state-of-the-art mobile computing technology aims to alleviate resource poverty of mobile devices. Recently, several approaches and techniques have been proposed to augment mobile devices by leveraging cloud computing. However, long-WAN latency and trust are still two major issues in MCC that hinder its vision. In this paper, we analyze MCC and discuss its issues. We leverage Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) to propose an arbitrated multi-tier infrastructure model named SAMI for MCC. Our architecture consists of three major layers, namely SOA, arbitrator, and infrastructure. The main strength of this architecture is in its multi-tier infrastructure layer which leverages infrastructures from three main sources of Clouds, Mobile Network Operators (MNOs), and MNOs' authorized dealers. On top of the infrastructure layer, an arbitrator layer is designed to classify Services and allocate them the suitable resources based on several metrics such as resource requirement, latency and security.

This integrated system is expected to improve the spectral efficiency and the channel data rate of the OCDMA network. The simulation is done using Optisys version 7.0. Spectral amplitude coding (SAC)-OCDMA is employed in this study because of its ability to suppress the Multiple Access Interference (MAI) using code sequences with fixed in-phase cross correlation. This system utilizes the zero cross correlation (ZCC) code. The performance of this hybrid system is shown through simulative experiment results of bit error rate (BER) and eye patterns for various numbers of subcarrier channels and frequencies. The simulation is done using Optisys version 7.0. It has been observed from the simulation results that up to eight RF channels can be added up in one optical channel for a successful transmission of 45km. It is also shown that higher subcarrier frequencies contribute to a better BER performance. This new hybrid system is proven to provide better spectral efficiency by accommodating larger number of simultaneous users with fewer optical channels, hence lowering the implementation cost. Thus, this system could be one promising solution to the symmetric high-capacity access network with high spectral efficiency, cost effective, good flexibility and enhanced security, which makes an attractive candidate for next-generation broadband access network.","publicationTitle":"2011 6th International Conference on Computer Sciences and Convergence Information Technology (ICCIT)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 6th International Conference on Computer Sciences and Convergence Information Technology (ICCIT)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6302083/6316561/06316591.pdf","startPage":"134","endPage":"139","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6316561","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Simulative performance of optical CDMA network with subcarrier multiplexing technique using zero cross correlation code","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6316591","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov. 29 2011-Dec. 1 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6316591/","displayDocTitle":"Simulative performance of optical CDMA network with subcarrier multiplexing technique using zero cross correlation code","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2011","accessionNumber":"13037328","conferenceDate":"29 Nov.-1 Dec. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"04 October 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Simulative performance of optical CDMA network with subcarrier multiplexing technique using zero cross correlation code","confLoc":"Seogwipo, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"ICCIT2011028.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044711S","chronDate":"Nov. 29 2011-Dec. 1 2011","isNumber":"6316561","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6302083","articleId":"6316591","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6316657,"authors":[{"name":"M.

This paper presents a new centralized adaptive Energy Based Clustering protocol through the application of Self organizing map neural networks (called EBC-S) which can cluster sensor nodes, based on multi parameters; energy level and coordinates of sensor nodes. We applied some maximum energy nodes as weights of SOM map units; so that the nodes with higher energy attract the nearest nodes with lower energy levels. Therefore, formed clusters may not necessarily contain adjacent nodes. The new algorithm enables us to form energy balanced clusters and equally distribute energy consumption. Simulation results and comparison with previous protocols(LEACH and LEA2C) prove that our new algorithm is able to extend the lifetime of the network.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov. 29 2011-Dec. 1 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6316662/","accessionNumber":"13037399","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"04 October 2012","conferenceDate":"29 Nov.-1 Dec. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A method for reduction of energy consumption in Wireless Sensor Network with using Neural Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A method for reduction of energy consumption in Wireless Sensor Network with using Neural Networks","confLoc":"Seogwipo, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"ICCIT2011099.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.033344S","chronDate":"Nov. 29 2011-Dec. 1 2011","isNumber":"6316561","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6302083","citationCount":"1","articleId":"6316662","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6316775,"authors":[{"name":"Mauro Tortonesi","affiliation":["Engineering Department, University of Ferrara, Italy"],"bio":{"p":["Mauro Tortonesi [m] (mauro.tortonesi@unife.it) received his Laurea degree in electronic engineering and his Ph.D. in computer science engineering from the University of Fer-rara, Italy.

Increasingly, UAVs need to cooperate with each other in order to perform complex tasks such as target monitoring and prosecution, information gathering and processing, and delivery between disconnected portions of the network. However, UAV cooperation in tactical scenarios represents a major challenge from both the coordination and communication perspectives. In fact, cooperating UAVs must achieve a high degree of coordination in order to accomplish complex tasks in a dynamic and uncertain environment. In turn, as UAVs interact with other entities, the effective coordination of multiple-UAV operations requires specific support in terms of efficient communication protocols and mechanisms exploiting UAVs as mobile assets that facilitate and hasten critical information flows. This article presents a series of considerations and lessons learned that we have collected in our experience with multiple- UAV coordination and communications in tactical edge networks, and discusses some of the main components of a middleware we specifically designed to support multiple-UAV operations.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sensors","Unmanned aerial vehicles","Middleware","Decision making","Vehicle dynamics","Monitoring","Optical fiber communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["aircraft communication","autonomous aerial vehicles","military systems","multi-robot systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiple-UAV coordination","multiple-UAV communications","tactical edge networks","unmanned aerial vehicles","target monitoring","information gathering","information processing","dynamic environment","uncertain environment","multiple-UAV operations","mobile assets","critical information flows"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6316775","doi":"10.1109/MCOM.2012.6316775","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel5/35/6316763/06316775.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MCOM.2012.6316775","startPage":"48","endPage":"55","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6316763","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiple-UAV coordination and communications in tactical edge networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Multiple-UAV coordination and communications in tactical edge networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6316775/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"October  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 October 2012","volume":"50","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/6316775/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"02 October 2012","publicationDate":"October 2012","accessionNumber":"13014910","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiple-UAV coordination and communications in tactical edge networks","sourcePdf":"012SURILAYOUT.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.06905S","chronDate":"October  2012","xplore-pub-id":"35","isNumber":"6316763","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"35","citationCount":"50","xplore-issue":"6316763","articleId":"6316775","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6316777,"authors":[{"name":"Peter Stenumgaard","affiliation":["Division for Communication Systems, Department of Electrical Engineering (ISY), Link\u00f6ping University, Sweden"],"bio":{"p":["Peter Stenumgaard (peter.stenumgaard@foi.se) is an adjunct professor at the Division for Communication Systems in the Department of Electrical Engineering (ISY) at Link\u00f6ping University (LiU), Sweden.

Basically, connectivity ensures that a message from a source can be spread to reach all the vehicles in the network. Over the past few years, there have been a significant number of studies on connectivity models for vehicular ad hoc networks. Most of them rely on the key assumption that the intervehicle spacing distribution is exponential. However, based on a new empirical analysis, it is shown that during most periods of the day the intervehicle spacing distribution can better be described by other statistical distributions. This certainly affects the connectivity analysis. In this article, we discuss how the connectivity of a vehicular ad hoc network in a highway traffic scenario will change when the intervehicle spacing distribution is not exponential.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Effects of intervehicle spacing distributions on connectivity of VANET: a case study from measured highway traffic","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","doi":"10.1109/MCOM.2012.6316781","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel5/35/6316763/06316781.pdf","startPage":"90","endPage":"97","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MCOM.2012.6316781","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6316763","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6316781","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6316781/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 October 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"October  2012","displayDocTitle":"Effects of intervehicle spacing distributions on connectivity of VANET: a case study from measured highway traffic","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"50","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/6316781/","dateOfInsertion":"02 October 2012","publicationDate":"October 2012","accessionNumber":"13014913","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Effects of intervehicle spacing distributions on connectivity of VANET: a case study from measured highway traffic","sourcePdf":"018CHENG1LAYOUT.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.079419S","chronDate":"October  2012","xplore-pub-id":"35","isNumber":"6316763","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"35","citationCount":"48","xplore-issue":"6316763","articleId":"6316781","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-21"},{"_id":6316784,"authors":[{"name":"Gil Engel","affiliation":["Analog Devices, Inc., USA"],"bio":{"p":["Gil Engel (Gil.Engel@analog.com) is a designer in the high-speed converter group at ADI, presently specializing in the design of high-speed high-performance digital-to-analog converters.

In this article, we have introduced the basic concept and development of a new wireless tongue-operated AT, called Tongue Drive System (TDS), that can wirelessly detect users' tongue movements using an array of magnetic sensors and a small magnetic tracer secured on the tongue, and translate them into a set of user-defined commands in real time, which can then be used to communicate with target devices in the users' environments. Our goal is to provide users with an unobtrusive, minimally invasive, low-power, high-bandwidth, wireless, wearable, easy-to-use, and aesthetically appealing solution that is superior to other existing ATs for people with the most severe physical disabilities. The performance of the latest TDS prototype has been evaluated by both able-bodied subjects and patients with high-level spinal cord injuries. Results have demonstrated that the TDS can indeed offer its users much higher communication bandwidth compared to EEGbased brain computer interfaces.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6316763","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MCOM.2012.6316786","doi":"10.1109/MCOM.2012.6316786","startPage":"128","endPage":"135","pdfPath":"/iel5/35/6316763/06316786.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6316786","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 October 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"October  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6316786/","displayDocTitle":"Tongue drive: a wireless tongue- operated means for people with severe disabilities to communicate their intentions","volume":"50","issue":"10","accessionNumber":"13014916","publicationDate":"October 2012","dateOfInsertion":"02 October 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6316786/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Tongue drive: a wireless tongue- operated means for people with severe disabilities to communicate their intentions","sourcePdf":"023GHOVANLOOLAYOUT.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.05021S","chronDate":"October  2012","xplore-pub-id":"35","isNumber":"6316763","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"35","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"6316763","articleId":"6316786","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6316788,"authors":[{"name":"Neelesh B.

In TAS, the number of RF chains for processing/up-conversion is smaller than the number of available antenna elements, so at any time the signals can only be transmitted from a (dynamically optimized) subset of antenna elements. As a result, the training procedure for AS needs to be carefully engineered. In LTE, this is accomplished by reusing the wideband sounding reference signal for the purpose of AS training. Furthermore, new mechanisms are required to facilitate feedback from the receiver (the base station) to the transmitter about which subset is optimal and should thus be used by the mobile. In LTE, this is accomplished by employing a unique masking technique on the downlink control channel that eliminates the feedback overhead at the expense of a minor increase in complexity at the mobile. This article provides an in-depth and systematic overview of all physical and higher layer features in the LTE standard that enable TAS. Also highlighted are the variety of technical and standardization challenges that drove the specification of AS in LTE, and the aspects of the LTE standard that are impacted by AS.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"October  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6316788/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 October 2012","volume":"50","issue":"10","accessionNumber":"13014917","publicationDate":"October 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6316788/","dateOfInsertion":"02 October 2012","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Antenna selection in LTE: from motivation to specification","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Antenna selection in LTE: from motivation to specification","sourcePdf":"025MEHTALAYOUT.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047494S","chronDate":"October  2012","xplore-pub-id":"35","isNumber":"6316763","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"35","citationCount":"63","xplore-issue":"6316763","articleId":"6316788","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6317091,"authors":[{"name":"Sang-Yun Shin","affiliation":["College of Information and Communication Engineering, Sungkyunkwan University, Suwon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Sang-Yun","lastName":"Shin","id":"38256993300"},{"name":"Min Jang","affiliation":["College of Information and Communication Engineering, Sungkyunkwan University, Suwon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Min","lastName":"Jang","id":"38255722300"},{"name":"Sang-Hyo Kim","affiliation":["College of Information and Communication Engineering, Sungkyunkwan University, Suwon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Sang-Hyo","lastName":"Kim","id":"37335986800"},{"name":"Byeungwoo Jeon","affiliation":["College of Information and Communication Engineering, Sungkyunkwan University, Suwon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Byeungwoo","lastName":"Jeon","id":"37288654000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"6317091","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":241},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Parity check codes","Decoding","Source coding","Correlation","Vectors","Indexes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["parity check codes","source coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["binary LDPCA codes","source revealing rate-adaptation","binary low density parity check accumulate codes","distributed source coding applications","source symbols","asymmetric DSC systems"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Distributed source coding","low-density parity-check nodes","LDPCA codes","source revealing","rate-adaptation"]}],"abstract":"In this letter, we consider binary low density parity check accumulate (LDPCA) codes with source revealing rate-adaptation for distributed source coding (DSC) applications.

We then address the case of slow fading, where we determine the optimal pair of rates that minimizes the sum distortion, using outage probabilities. Results show that the sum distortion for slow fading is larger than for fast fading and that the use of individual outage probabilities outperforms the use of common outage probability. The higher variance source requires higher rates in both fast and slow fading.","pdfPath":"/iel5/4234/6361502/06317098.pdf","startPage":"1784","endPage":"1787","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6361502","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCOMM.2012.092112.121526","doi":"10.1109/LCOMM.2012.092112.121526","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6317098","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Signal to noise ratio","Resource management","Receivers","Rayleigh channels","Wireless communication","Source coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel allocation","channel capacity","Gaussian channels","probability","Rayleigh channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["rate allocation","Gaussian source","Rayleigh fading channel","ergodic capacity region","outage probability","multiple access channel"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Sum distortion","multiple access channel","capacity region","outage probability"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"November  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6317098/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 October 2012","displayDocTitle":"Rate Allocation for Transmission of Two Gaussian Sources over Multiple Access Fading Channels","accessionNumber":"13146820","dateOfInsertion":"26 November 2012","publicationDate":"November 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6317098/","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"16","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Rate Allocation for Transmission of Two Gaussian Sources over Multiple Access Fading Channels","sourcePdf":"1784-cl1211-kafed.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.048708S","chronDate":"November  2012","xplore-pub-id":"4234","isNumber":"6361502","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4234","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6361502","articleId":"6317098","onlineDate":"02 October 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6317105,"authors":[{"name":"Renchao Xie","affiliation":["Department of Systems and Computer Engineering, Carleton University, Ottawa, ONT, Canada","Key Laboratory of Universal Wireless Communication, Ministry of Education, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/6361508/6317105/6317105-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Renchao Xie received the Ph.

However, most of previous works are focused on spectrum sharing and interference avoidance, and the energy efficiency aspect is largely ignored. In this paper, we study the energy efficiency aspect of spectrum sharing and power allocation in heterogeneous cognitive radio networks with femtocells. To fully exploit the cognitive capability, we consider a wireless network architecture in which both the macrocell and the femtocell have the cognitive capability. We formulate the energy-efficient resource allocation problem in heterogeneous cognitive radio networks with femtocells as a Stackelberg game. A gradient based iteration algorithm is proposed to obtain the Stackelberg equilibrium solution to the energy-efficient resource allocation problem. Simulation results are presented to demonstrate the Stackelberg equilibrium is obtained by the proposed iteration algorithm and energy efficiency can be improved significantly in the proposed scheme.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2012.092112.111510","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6361508","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2012.092112.111510","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/6361508/06317105.pdf","startPage":"3910","endPage":"3920","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy-Efficient Resource Allocation for Heterogeneous Cognitive Radio Networks with Femtocells","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 October 2012","displayDocTitle":"Energy-Efficient Resource Allocation for Heterogeneous Cognitive Radio Networks with Femtocells","volume":"11","issue":"11","chronOrPublicationDate":"November  2012","dateOfInsertion":"26 November 2012","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6317105/","publicationDate":"November 2012","accessionNumber":"13148971","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6317105/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy-Efficient Resource Allocation for Heterogeneous Cognitive Radio Networks with Femtocells","sourcePdf":"3910-tw1211-xie.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.11503S","chronDate":"November  2012","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6361508","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"153","xplore-issue":"6361508","articleId":"6317105","onlineDate":"02 October 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6317106,"authors":[{"name":"B.

In fixed gain relaying, the relay gain is fixed but its transmit power varies as a function of the source-relay channel gain. In fixed power relaying, the relay transmit power is fixed, but its gain varies. We revisit and generalize the fundamental two-hop AF relaying model. We present an optimal scheme in which an average power constrained AF relay adapts its gain and transmit power to minimize the symbol error probability (SEP) at the destination. Also derived are insightful and practically amenable closed-form bounds for the optimal relay gain. We then analyze the SEP of MPSK, derive tight bounds for it, and characterize the diversity order for Rayleigh fading. Also derived is an SEP approximation that is accurate to within 0.1 dB. Extensive results show that the scheme yields significant energy savings of 2.0-7.7 dB at the source and relay. Optimal relay placement for the proposed scheme is also characterized, and is different from fixed gain or power relaying. Generalizations to MQAM and other fading distributions are also discussed.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2012.092112.120211","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2012.092112.120211","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/6361508/06317106.pdf","startPage":"4118","endPage":"4127","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6361508","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Generalizing the Amplify-and-Forward Relay Gain Model: An Optimal SEP Perspective","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6317106/","chronOrPublicationDate":"November  2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 October 2012","displayDocTitle":"Generalizing the Amplify-and-Forward Relay Gain Model: An Optimal SEP Perspective","volume":"11","issue":"11","dateOfInsertion":"26 November 2012","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"November 2012","accessionNumber":"13148972","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6317106/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Generalizing the Amplify-and-Forward Relay Gain Model: An Optimal SEP Perspective","sourcePdf":"4118-tw1211-sainath.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.086723S","chronDate":"November  2012","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6361508","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"6361508","articleId":"6317106","onlineDate":"02 October 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6317107,"authors":[{"name":"Alberto Rico-Alvarino","affiliation":["Signal Theory and Communications Department, University of Vigo, Vigo, Spain"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/6361508/6317107/6317107-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Alberto Rico-Alvari\u00f1o (S'12) received the Telecommunications Engineering degree from the University of Vigo, Vigo, Spain, in 2010 and the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from the same university in 2012.

First, we derive a range for the number of channels to be sensed per SU access. Then, the analytical average system throughput is attained for cases where the number of idle channels is a random variable. Based on that, a relationship between the average system throughput and the number of sensing channels is attained. Subsequently, a joint optimization problem is formulated in order to maximize average system throughput. The analytical results are validated by substantial simulations.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2012.092112.111425","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6361508","startPage":"3900","endPage":"3909","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/6361508/06317108.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Throughput Analysis for a Multi-User, Multi-Channel ALOHA Cognitive Radio System","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6317108/","chronOrPublicationDate":"November  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 October 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6317108/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Throughput Analysis for a Multi-User, Multi-Channel ALOHA Cognitive Radio System","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"November 2012","accessionNumber":"13148974","dateOfInsertion":"26 November 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"11","issue":"11","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Throughput Analysis for a Multi-User, Multi-Channel ALOHA Cognitive Radio System","sourcePdf":"3900-tw1211-li.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.096491S","chronDate":"November  2012","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6361508","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"6361508","articleId":"6317108","onlineDate":"02 October 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6317110,"authors":[{"name":"Tao Yang","affiliation":["CSIRO ICT Centre, Marsfield, NSW, Australia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/6361508/6317110/6317110-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Tao Yang (S'07, M'10) received B.Sc. degree in electronic engineering in 2003 from Beijing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics (Beihang University), Beijing, China.

Assuming that the relay beamforming weights as well as the transceiver transmit powers are the design parameters, this region is characterized under a constraint on the total (network) transmit power consumption. Using the shape of the rate region, we then use a sum-rate maximization approach to obtain the jointly optimal relay beamforming weights and transceiver transmit powers. Interestingly, we show that the sum-rate maximization approach yields the same solution as the max-min fair design approach does. Using this relationship, we further present a semi-closed-form solution to the underlying distributed beamforming problem. We then prove that the transmit power of any of the two transceivers can be obtained as the solution to a one-dimensional optimization problem using a simple bisection method which enjoys a low computational complexity.

We first generalize the IPA by relaxing the original constraint that the measurement matrix must be binary. The new algorithm operates on any non-negative sparse measurement matrix. We give a performance comparison of the generalized IPA with the reconstruction algorithms based on 1) linear programming and 2) verification decoding. Then we identify signals not recoverable by the IPA on a given measurement matrix, and show that these signals are related to stopping sets responsible to failures of iterative decoding algorithms on the binary erasure channel (BEC). Contrary to the results of the iterative decoding on the BEC, the smallest stopping set of a measurement matrix is not the smallest configuration on which the IPA fails. We analyze the recovery of sparse signals on subsets of stopping sets via the IPA and provide sufficient conditions on the exact recovery of sparse signals. Reconstruction performance of the IPA using the IEEE 802.16e LDPC codes as measurement matrices are given to show the effect of stopping sets in the performance of the IPA.","doi":"10.1109/JETCAS.2012.2218512","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6374660","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JETCAS.2012.2218512","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Emerging and Selected Topics in Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Emerging and Selected Topics in Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5503868/6374660/06317120.pdf","startPage":"424","endPage":"432","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Interval-Passing Algorithm for Non-Negative Measurement Matrices: Performance and Reconstruction Analysis","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 October 2012","displayDocTitle":"Interval-Passing Algorithm for Non-Negative Measurement Matrices: Performance and Reconstruction Analysis","volume":"2","issue":"3","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2012","dateOfInsertion":"27 December 2012","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6317120/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2012","accessionNumber":"13167805","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6317120/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Interval-Passing Algorithm for Non-Negative Measurement Matrices: Performance and Reconstruction Analysis","sourcePdf":"jetcas-danjean-2218512-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.100843S","chronDate":"Sept.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"5503868","isNumber":"6374660","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5503868","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"6374660","articleId":"6317120","onlineDate":"02 October 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6317130,"authors":[{"name":"Damin Cao","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Texas, Dallas, Richardson, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Damin","lastName":"Cao","id":"38490322000"},{"name":"Arezoo Modiri","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Texas, Dallas, Richardson, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Arezoo","lastName":"Modiri","id":"37589760000"},{"name":"Gaurav Sureka","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Texas, Dallas, Richardson, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Gaurav","lastName":"Sureka","id":"37671081000"},{"name":"Kamran Kiasaleh","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Texas, Dallas, Richardson, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Kamran","lastName":"Kiasaleh","id":"37284873000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1536-1225"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1548-5757"}],"articleNumber":"6317130","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":860},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society","url":"http://www.ieeeaps.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6317130","abstract":"Efficient implementation of sophisticated algorithms on digital signal processing (DSP) chips is a key issue in the implementation of software-defined radios.

In a spatial superchannel, the SDM modes at a given wavelength are routed together, allowing a simplified design of both transponders and optical routing equipment. For example, common-mode impairments can be exploited to streamline the receiver's DSP. Our laboratory measurements reveal that the phase fluctuations between the cores of a multicore fiber are strongly correlated, and therefore constitute such a common-mode impairment. We implement master-slave phase recovery of two simultaneous 112-Gbps subchannels in a seven-core fiber, demonstrating reduced processing complexity with no increase in the bit-error ratio. Furthermore, we investigate the feasibility of applying this technique to subchannels carried on separate single-mode fibers, a potential transition strategy to evolve today's fiber networks toward future networks using multicore fibers.","doi":"10.1109/LPT.2012.2220672","publicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Technology Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Technology Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/68/6329965/06317137.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LPT.2012.2220672","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6329965","startPage":"1957","endPage":"1960","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint Digital Signal Processing Receivers for Spatial Superchannels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6317137","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Joint Digital Signal Processing Receivers for Spatial Superchannels","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.1,  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6317137/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 October 2012","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"24","issue":"21","publicationDate":"Nov.1, 2012","accessionNumber":"13090699","dateOfInsertion":"22 October 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6317137/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint Digital Signal Processing Receivers for Spatial Superchannels","sourcePdf":"lpt-feuer-2220672-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.040798S","chronDate":"Nov.1,  2012","xplore-pub-id":"68","isNumber":"6329965","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"68","citationCount":"76","xplore-issue":"6329965","articleId":"6317137","onlineDate":"02 October 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6317139,"authors":[{"name":"Roland Ryf","affiliation":["Bell Laboratories, Holmdel, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Roland","lastName":"Ryf","id":"37274582100"},{"name":"Nicolas K.

By casting speech segregation as a binary classification problem, recent advances have been made in computational auditory scene analysis on segregation of both voiced and unvoiced speech. So far, pitch and amplitude modulation spectrogram have been used as two main kinds of time-frequency (T-F) unit level features in classification. In this paper, we expand T-F unit features to include gammatone frequency cepstral coefficients (GFCC), mel-frequency cepstral coefficients, relative spectral transform (RASTA) and perceptual linear prediction (PLP). Comprehensive comparisons are performed in order to identify effective features for classification-based speech segregation. Our experiments in matched and unmatched test conditions show that these newly included features significantly improve speech segregation performance. Specifically, GFCC and RASTA-PLP are the best single features in matched-noise and unmatched-noise test conditions, respectively. We also find that pitch-based features are crucial for good generalization to unseen environments. To further explore complementarity in terms of discriminative power, we propose to use a group Lasso approach to select complementary features in a principled way. The final combined feature set yields promising results in both matched and unmatched test conditions.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/10376/6359939/06317144.pdf","startPage":"270","endPage":"279","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","doi":"10.1109/TASL.2012.2221459","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TASL.2012.2221459","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6359939","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6317144","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Exploring Monaural Features for Classification-Based Speech Segregation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Speech","Feature extraction","Mel frequency cepstral coefficient","Signal to noise ratio","Training"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplitude modulation","cepstral analysis","speech processing","time-frequency analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["monaural feature exploration","classification-based speech segregation","monaural speech segregation","binary classification problem","computational auditory scene analysis","unvoiced speech","voiced speech","amplitude modulation spectrogram","pitch modulation spectrogram","time-frequency unit level feature","T-F unit level feature","gammatone frequency cepstral coefficient","GFCC","mel-frequency cepstral coefficient","relative spectral transform","RASTA","perceptual linear prediction","PLP","matched testing","unmatched-noise test condition","group Lasso approach"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Binary classification","computational auditory scene analysis (CASA)","feature combination","group Lasso","monaural speech segregation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6317144/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 October 2012","displayDocTitle":"Exploring Monaural Features for Classification-Based Speech Segregation","volume":"21","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/6317144/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2013","accessionNumber":"13136521","dateOfInsertion":"21 November 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Exploring Monaural Features for Classification-Based Speech Segregation","sourcePdf":"tasl-wang-2221459-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.098643S","chronDate":"Feb.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"10376","isNumber":"6359939","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10376","citationCount":"122","xplore-issue":"6359939","articleId":"6317144","onlineDate":"02 October 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6317146,"authors":[{"name":"Chien-Yi Huang","affiliation":["Department of Industrial Engineering and Management, National Taipei University of Technology, Taipei, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5503870/6342919/6317146/6317146-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Chien-Yi Huang received the Ph.D. degree from the State University of New York at Binghamton, Vestal in 1996.","He is currently an Associate Professor with the National Taipei University of Technology, Taipei, Taiwan.

As lighting technology evolves, illumination devices are moving toward miniaturization and high-power applications. Packaging of illumination devices is essential to providing a path for heat dispersion. A full understanding of the viscosity change of the encapsulation material is critical to ensure manufacturability and improved process yield. The typical viscosity model is the initial viscosity plus the change in viscosity over time at a given temperature. The change in viscosity is a function of the reaction rate and the pro-exponential factor. This paper includes the pro-exponential factor in the regression model to improve the prediction accuracy. Through experimental data, the material's viscosity is determined as a function of process temperature, the ratio of the curing agent, and the curing time. A computer-aided parametric design is used to assess the effect of the variation of individual factors on the quality function and proposes a robust LED encapsulation process. An artificial neural network that considers interactions between parameters and establishes fitness functions is used to further enhance the accuracy of predictions and determine the optimal process solution through an iterative training algorithm. The optimal process scenario suggested by this research is a 10% curing agent preheated at 333\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">\u00b0</sup>\nK for 40 min.

The intra coding framework of HEVC follows that of traditional hybrid codecs and is built on spatial sample prediction followed by transform coding and postprocessing steps. Novel features contributing to the increased compression efficiency include a quadtree-based variable block size coding structure, block-size agnostic angular and planar prediction, adaptive pre- and postfiltering, and prediction direction-based transform coefficient scanning. This paper discusses the design principles applied during the development of the new intra coding methods and analyzes the compression performance of the individual tools. Computational complexity of the introduced intra prediction algorithms is analyzed both by deriving operational cycle counts and benchmarking an optimized implementation. Using objective metrics, the bitrate reduction provided by the HEVC intra coding over the H.264/advanced video coding reference is reported to be 22% on average and up to 36%. Significant subjective picture quality improvements are also reported when comparing the resulting pictures at fixed bitrate.","doi":"10.1109/TCSVT.2012.2221525","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/76/6403920/06317153.pdf","startPage":"1792","endPage":"1801","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSVT.2012.2221525","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6403920","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Intra Coding of the HEVC Standard","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6317153","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 October 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6317153/","displayDocTitle":"Intra Coding of the HEVC Standard","volume":"22","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","accessionNumber":"13219082","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6317153/","dateOfInsertion":"08 January 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Intra Coding of the HEVC Standard","sourcePdf":"tcsvt-han-2221525-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.07482S","chronDate":"Dec.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"76","isNumber":"6403920","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"443","xplore-issue":"6403920","articleId":"6317153","onlineDate":"02 October 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":6317155,"authors":[{"name":"Guorong Li","affiliation":["University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/76/6491457/6317155/6317155-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Guorong Li received the B.S. degree in technology of computer application from the Renmin University of China, Beijing, China, in 2006, and the Ph.D. degree in technology of computer application from the Graduate University of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (GUCAS), Beijing, in 2012.","She is currently a Post-Doctoral Fellow with GUCAS.

However, according to our statistical analysis on very common videos, this assumption is not true in many scenarios. As a result, the selected features are not suitable for discriminating between the target from the background in the next frame. A tracking error accumulates and finally the drift problem happens. In this paper, we consider data distribution in tracking from a new perspective to adapt to target's and background's changes. We classify the samples into three categories: auxiliary samples (samples in the previous frames), target samples (samples collected in the current frame), and unlabeled samples (samples obtained in the next frame). To make the best use of them for tracking, we propose a novel semisupervised transfer learning approach that treats samples differently. Specifically, we assume that only target samples follow the same distribution as the unlabeled samples that we want to classify. Then, a novel and interesting semisupervised CovBoost method is developed utilizing the information provided by the three kinds of samples effectively when training the best strong classifier for tracking. Furthermore, we develop a new online updating algorithm for semisupervised CovBoost, making our tracker handle with significant variations of the tracked target and background successfully. Our experimental results demonstrate the advantages of treating samples differently during tracking. Our tracker outperforms state-of-the-art trackers on the benchmark datasets.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6317155/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 October 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6317155/","dateOfInsertion":"01 April 2013","publicationDate":"April 2013","accessionNumber":"13412985","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"23","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"SSOCBT: A Robust Semisupervised Online CovBoost Tracker That Uses Samples Differently","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SSOCBT: A Robust Semisupervised Online CovBoost Tracker That Uses Samples Differently","sourcePdf":"tcsvt-li-2221257-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.09418S","chronDate":"April  2013","xplore-pub-id":"76","isNumber":"6491457","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"6491457","articleId":"6317155","onlineDate":"02 October 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6317156,"authors":[{"name":"Jens-Rainer Ohm","affiliation":["Institute of Communication Engineering, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/76/6403920/6317156/6317156-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jens-Rainer Ohm (M'92) received the Dipl.-Ing., Dr.-Ing., and Habil. degrees from the Technical University of Berlin (TUB), Berlin, Germany, in 1985, 1990, and 1997, respectively.","From 1985 to 1995, he was a Research Associate with the Institute of Telecommunication, TUB. from 1992 to 2000, he has served as a Lecturer on digital image processing, coding and transmission at TUB. from 1996 to 2000, he was a Project Coordinator with the Heinrich Hertz Institute, Berlin. in 2000, he became a Full Professor and since then has been the Chair of the Institute of Communication Engineering, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany.

While it provides high coding efficiency, the data dependencies in H.264/AVC CABAC make it challenging to parallelize and thus, limit its throughput. Accordingly, during the standardization of entropy coding for HEVC, both coding efficiency and throughput were considered. This paper highlights the key techniques that were used to enable HEVC to potentially achieve higher throughput while delivering coding gains relative to H.264/AVC. These techniques include reducing context coded bins, grouping bypass bins, grouping bins with the same context, reducing context selection dependencies, reducing total bins, and reducing parsing dependencies. It also describes reductions to memory requirements that benefit both throughput and implementation costs. Proposed and adopted techniques up to draft international standard (test model HM-8.0) are discussed. In addition, analysis and simulation results are provided to quantify the throughput improvements and memory reduction compared with H.264/AVC. In HEVC, the maximum number of context-coded bins is reduced by 8\u00d7, and the context memory and line buffer are reduced by 3\u00d7 and 20\u00d7, respectively. This paper illustrates that accounting for implementation cost when designing video coding algorithms can result in a design that enables higher processing speed and lowers hardware costs, while still delivering high coding efficiency.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High Throughput CABAC Entropy Coding in HEVC","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","doi":"10.1109/TCSVT.2012.2221526","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/76/6403920/06317157.pdf","startPage":"1778","endPage":"1791","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSVT.2012.2221526","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6403920","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6317157","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6317157/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 October 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2012","displayDocTitle":"High Throughput CABAC Entropy Coding in HEVC","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"22","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/6317157/","dateOfInsertion":"08 January 2013","publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","accessionNumber":"13219085","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High Throughput CABAC Entropy Coding in HEVC","sourcePdf":"tcsvt-sze-2221526-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.1078S","chronDate":"Dec.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"76","isNumber":"6403920","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"125","xplore-issue":"6403920","articleId":"6317157","onlineDate":"02 October 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-22"},{"_id":6317159,"authors":[{"name":"Minhua Zhou","affiliation":["Texas Instruments, Inc., Dallas, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Minhua","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37651715800"},{"name":"Wen Gao","affiliation":["Huawei Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Wen","lastName":"Gao","id":"37086628023"},{"name":"Minqiang Jiang","affiliation":["Huawei Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Minqiang","lastName":"Jiang","id":"37086628368"},{"name":"Haoping Yu","affiliation":["Huawei Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Haoping","lastName":"Yu","id":"37085548909"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1051-8215"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2205"}],"articleNumber":"6317159","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":84,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":3380},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Encoding","Image coding","Video coding","Streaming media"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["interpolation","video coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["HEVC lossless coding","nonlossless coding mode","high efficiency video coding main profile","in-loop filters","quantization parameter value","bit-rate reduction","lossless compression solutions","JPEG2000","JPEG-LS","7-Zip","WinRAR","data archiving","sample-based angular intraprediction method","SAP method","prediction mode signaling method","interpolation method","block-based angular prediction","intraprediction accuracy","prediction sample"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Block-based angular intra prediction","High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC)","lossless coding","sample-based angular intra prediction (SAP)"]}],"abstract":"The lossless coding mode of the High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC) main profile that bypasses transform, quantization, and in-loop filters is described.

It also significantly outperforms the existing lossless compression solutions, such as JPEG2000 and JPEG-LS for images as well as 7-Zip and WinRAR for data archiving. To further improve the coding efficiency of the HEVC lossless mode, a sample-based angular intra prediction (SAP) method is presented. The SAP employs the same prediction mode signaling method and the sample interpolation method as the HEVC block-based angular prediction, but uses adjacent neighbors for better intra prediction accuracy and performs prediction sample by sample.

For large PGS, the probability for partially shaded condition (PSC) to occur is also high. Under PSC, the P-V curve of PGS exhibits multiple peaks, which reduces the effectiveness of conventional maximum power point tracking (MPPT) methods. In this paper, a particle swarm optimization (PSO)-based MPPT algorithm for PGS operating under PSC is proposed. The standard version of PSO is modified to meet the practical consideration of PGS operating under PSC. The problem formulation, design procedure, and parameter setting method which takes the hardware limitation into account are described and explained in detail. The proposed method boasts the advantages such as easy to implement, system-independent, and high tracking efficiency. To validate the correctness of the proposed method, simulation, and experimental results of a 500-W PGS will also be provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed technique.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Geoscience"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6317161/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 October 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","accessionNumber":"13136478","htmlLink":"/document/6317161/","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"16 November 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"27","issue":"4","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Particle Swarm Optimization-Based Maximum Power Point Tracking Algorithm for PV Systems Operating Under Partially Shaded Conditions","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Particle Swarm Optimization-Based Maximum Power Point Tracking Algorithm for PV Systems Operating Under Partially Shaded Conditions","sourcePdf":"tec-liu-2219533-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.074088S","chronDate":"Dec.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"60","isNumber":"6340605","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"60","citationCount":"309","xplore-issue":"6340605","articleId":"6317161","onlineDate":"02 October 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6317166,"authors":[{"name":"Seyyed Mehdi Mirimani","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Iran University of Science & Technology, Tehran, Iran"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/28/6399585/6317166/6317166-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Seyyed Mehdi Mirimani (S'07) was born in Babol, Iran.

The use of numerical modeling makes it possible to precisely study the eccentricity fault detection in these types of machines. The simulations are validated using experimental measurements. To the best knowledge of the authors, SE fault detection in AFPMs has not been studied before. Hence, a new definition for the SE factor is presented in these types of machines. A motor with different degrees of rotor eccentricity is simulated, and the back electromotive force (EMF) of all coils of the stator is obtained. In addition, an appropriate criterion has been presented for the fault detection using the back EMF of the coils. This study indicates that the back EMF of the coils of the stator is a good criterion for eccentricity fault detection. It is observed that the unbalanced back EMF suggests a method for the indirect measurement of eccentricity that could be carried out during manufacturing and assembling processes or maintenance operation.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6317166/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 October 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.-Dec.  2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","publicationDate":"Nov.-Dec. 2012","accessionNumber":"13191342","htmlLink":"/document/6317166/","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"04 January 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"48","issue":"6","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Static Eccentricity Fault Detection in Single-Stator\u2013Single-Rotor Axial-Flux Permanent-Magnet Machines","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Static Eccentricity Fault Detection in Single-Stator\u2013Single-Rotor Axial-Flux Permanent-Magnet Machines","sourcePdf":"tia-mirimani-2221673-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.10691S","chronDate":"Nov.-Dec.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"28","isNumber":"6399585","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"28","citationCount":"39","xplore-issue":"6399585","articleId":"6317166","onlineDate":"02 October 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6317173,"authors":[{"name":"Tomi Roinila","affiliation":["Department of Automation Science and Engineering, Tampere University of Technology, Tampere, Finland"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/6525345/6317173/6317173-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Tomi Roinila (M'10) received the M.Sc.

This means that the reliable operation of the converters is of prime importance and that the functioning must be verified during both the design phase and production. Recent studies have shown that the converters can be fully characterized by a set of frequency responses that can be efficiently used to validate the operation of the converters and analyze the related systems. Several methods have been proposed for quickly and accurately measuring the frequency responses, but surprisingly, the use of multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) identification techniques has not been considered. Applying MIMO identification techniques, the operating conditions of a converter can be kept constant during the frequency-response measurements, and the overall measurement time can be further shortened. This paper reviews the techniques and proposes an implementation setup. The presented techniques provide efficient means to characterize the switched-mode converters during one measurement cycle. The methods can be used for example in field-programmable gate-array-based controller implementation and in fast online analysis. Experimental measurements are shown from a high-frequency switched-mode converter.","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2012.2221118","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/6525345/06317173.pdf","startPage":"5270","endPage":"5276","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2012.2221118","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6525345","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On Frequency-Response Measurements of Power-Electronic Systems Applying MIMO Identification Techniques","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6317173","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 October 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6317173/","displayDocTitle":"On Frequency-Response Measurements of Power-Electronic Systems Applying MIMO Identification Techniques","volume":"60","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 2013","accessionNumber":"13563556","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6317173/","dateOfInsertion":"06 June 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On Frequency-Response Measurements of Power-Electronic Systems Applying MIMO Identification Techniques","sourcePdf":"tie-roinila-2221118-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.074359S","chronDate":"Nov.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"6525345","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"6525345","articleId":"6317173","onlineDate":"02 October 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6317175,"authors":[{"name":"Eduardo Cabal-Yepez","affiliation":["HSPdigital\u2014CA Telematica/Procesamiento Digital de Senales, Universidad de Guanajuato, Salamanca, Guanajuato, Mexico"],"firstName":"Eduardo","lastName":"Cabal-Yepez","id":"38277709400"},{"name":"Armando G.

Three study cases (electric current supply to an induction motor during startup transient, voltage supply to an induction motor through a variable speed drive, and vibration signals from industrial-robot links) show the suitability of the proposed monitoring system for time-frequency analysis of different signals in distinct industrial applications, and early diagnosis and prognosis of abnormalities in monitored systems.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reconfigurable Monitoring System for Time-Frequency Analysis on Industrial Equipment Through STFT and DWT","doi":"10.1109/TII.2012.2221131","endPage":"771","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics","pdfPath":"/iel5/9424/6409420/06317175.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics","startPage":"760","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TII.2012.2221131","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6409420","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6317175","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Monitoring","Discrete wavelet transforms","Induction motors","Time frequency analysis","System-on-a-chip","Hardware","Vibrations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["condition monitoring","discrete wavelet transforms","Fourier transforms","integrated circuit design","product quality","production equipment","system-on-chip","time-frequency analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["reconfigurable monitoring system","time-frequency analysis","industrial equipment","STFT","DWT","product quality","safety","vibrations","system-on-chip design","SoC design","equipment monitoring","reconfigurable hardware","customized embedded processor","short-time Fourier transform","discrete wavelet transform"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Discrete wavelet transform (DWT)","field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs)","short-time Fourier transform (STFT)","system monitoring","system-on-chip (SoC)","time-frequency analysis"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Reconfigurable Monitoring System for Time-Frequency Analysis on Industrial Equipment Through STFT and DWT","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6317175/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 October 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2013","volume":"9","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 2013","dateOfInsertion":"11 January 2013","accessionNumber":"13220090","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reconfigurable Monitoring System for Time-Frequency Analysis on Industrial Equipment Through STFT and DWT","sourcePdf":"tii-cabalyepez-2221131-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.051301S","chronDate":"May  2013","isNumber":"6409420","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9424","citationCount":"114","articleId":"6317175","onlineDate":"02 October 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":6317180,"authors":[{"name":"Zhixun Ma","affiliation":["Institute for Electrical Drive Systems and Power Electronics, Technical University of Munich, Munich, Germany"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/9424/6582568/6317180/6317180-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Zhixun Ma was born in Jiangsu, China, in 1984.

The linearly compensated flux observer, based on back electromotive force (EMF) is used for sensorless control in the high speed range. The flux observer exhibits high dynamic and steady-state performance and is robust to parameter variation.

Modeling rank modulation involves construction of packings of the space of permutations equipped with the Kendall tau distance. As our main set of results, we present several general constructions of codes in permutations that cover a broad range of code parameters. In particular, we show a number of ways in which conventional error-correcting codes can be modified to correct errors in the Kendall space. Our constructions are nonasymptotic and afford simple encoding and decoding algorithms of essentially the same complexity as required to correct errors in the Hamming metric. As an example, from binary Bose-Chaudhuri-Hocquenghem codes, we obtain codes correcting \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">t</i>\n Kendall errors in \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">n</i>\n memory cells that support the order of \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">n</i>\n!/(log\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sub>\n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">n</i>\n!)\n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">t</i>\n messages, for any constant \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">t</i>\n=1,2,.... We give many examples of rank modulation codes with specific parameters. Turning to asymptotic analysis, we construct families of rank modulation codes that correct a number of errors that grows with \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">n</i>\n at varying rates, from \u0398(\n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">n</i>\n) to \u0398(\n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">n</i>\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n). One of our constructions gives rise to a family of rank modulation codes for which the tradeoff between the number of messages and the number of correctable Kendall errors approaches the optimal scaling rate.","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2012.2221121","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/6413249/06317187.pdf","startPage":"1018","endPage":"1029","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2012.2221121","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6413249","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Constructions of Rank Modulation Codes","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6317187/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 October 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2013","displayDocTitle":"Constructions of Rank Modulation Codes","volume":"59","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2013","accessionNumber":"13234718","dateOfInsertion":"16 January 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Constructions of Rank Modulation Codes","sourcePdf":"tit-mazumdar-2221121-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.055331S","chronDate":"Feb.  2013","isNumber":"6413249","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"33","articleId":"6317187","onlineDate":"02 October 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6317194,"authors":[{"name":"Haibing Hu","affiliation":["Jiangsu Key Laboratory of New Energy Generation and Power Conversion, College of Automation Engineering, Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Nanjing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/6376188/6317194/6317194-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Haibing Hu (M\u201909) received the B.S. degree from the Hunan University of Technology, Hunan, China, in 1995, and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from Zhejiang University, Zhejiang, China, in 2003 and 2007, respectively.","From 2007 to 2009, he was an Assistant Professor in the Department of Control engineering, Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Nanjing, China, where he is currently an Associate Professor.

The results are sometime given as a certain forbidden region in the complex plane out of which the impedance ratio--known as minor-loop gain--shall stay for ensuring robust stability. This letter discusses the circle-like forbidden region occupying minimum area in the complex plane, defined by applying maximum peak criteria, which is well-known theory in control engineering. The investigation shows that the circle-like forbidden region will ensure robust stability only if the impedance-based minor-loop gain is determined at the very input or output of each subsystem within the interconnected system. Experimental evidence is provided based on a small-scale dc/dc distributed system.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/63/6361328/06317195.pdf","startPage":"2099","endPage":"2104","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2012.2220157","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2012.2220157","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6361328","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6317195","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Impedance-Based Stability and Transient-Performance Assessment Applying Maximum Peak Criteria","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Impedance","Gain","Stability criteria","Robust stability","Sensitivity","Gain measurement","Transfer functions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["circuit stability","DC-DC power convertors","switching convertors","transient analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["transient-performance assessment","maximum peak criteria","impedance-based stability-assessment method","interconnected DC-DC systems","grid-connected renewable energy systems","minor-loop gain","circle-like forbidden region","control engineering","robust stability","impedance-based minor-loop gain","small-scale DC-DC distributed system","switched-mode converter","impedance ratio"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Minor-loop gain","sensitivity function","stability","switched-mode converter","transient performance"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6317195/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 October 2012","displayDocTitle":"Impedance-Based Stability and Transient-Performance Assessment Applying Maximum Peak Criteria","volume":"28","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/6317195/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2013","accessionNumber":"13146904","dateOfInsertion":"22 November 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Impedance-Based Stability and Transient-Performance Assessment Applying Maximum Peak Criteria","sourcePdf":"tpel-suntio-2220157-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.059458S","chronDate":"May  2013","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"6361328","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"119","xplore-issue":"6361328","articleId":"6317195","onlineDate":"02 October 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6317196,"authors":[{"name":"Gyorgy D.

The power conditioning system, implemented with discrete components, is self-starting and fully autonomous, and based upon a full-wave boost rectifier topology. The design utilizes the stray inductance of the harvester's coil, eliminating the need for separate inductors, and employs open-loop control that reduces the quiescent power overhead to just 21 \u03bcW, while still extracting 84% of the maximum available power from the harvester. The design of the subsystems, including self-start circuitry, is described in detail, and it is shown that careful active device selection is required to minimize losses. It is experimentally demonstrated that the power converter achieves conversion efficiencies of up to 76% at submilliwatt power levels, including quiescent losses. The overall system efficiency peaks at 65% at 0.9 mW, while still achieving 51% at 200 \u03bcW. The ability of this system to operate efficiently at ultralow average power levels opens up new possibilities to further miniaturize vibration harvesters and deploy them into environments with lower vibration levels than is currently possible.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Ultralow Power, Fully Autonomous Boost Rectifier for Electromagnetic Energy Harvesters","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2012.2219594","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/63/6392980/06317196.pdf","startPage":"3353","endPage":"3362","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2012.2219594","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6392980","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6317196","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6317196/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 October 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2013","displayDocTitle":"Ultralow Power, Fully Autonomous Boost Rectifier for Electromagnetic Energy Harvesters","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"28","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/6317196/","dateOfInsertion":"24 December 2012","publicationDate":"July 2013","accessionNumber":"13191056","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ultralow Power, Fully Autonomous Boost Rectifier for Electromagnetic Energy Harvesters","sourcePdf":"tpel-szarka-2219594-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.074799S","chronDate":"July  2013","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"6392980","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"58","xplore-issue":"6392980","articleId":"6317196","onlineDate":"02 October 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6317202,"authors":[{"name":"Md.

By introducing the variable slopes and an inflexion point in the target probability density function, more flexibility in the companding form and an effective trade-off between the PAPR and bit error rate performances can be achieved. A theoretical performance study for this algorithm is presented and closed-form expressions regarding the achievable transform gain and signal attenuation factor are provided.

Although weather prediction and meteorology is a very complex and imprecise science, recent research activities with artificial neural network (ANN) have shown that it has powerful pattern classification and pattern recognition capabilities which can be used as a tool to get a reasonable accurate prediction of weather patterns. This paper presents an application of Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to estimate the Daily Mean, Maximum and Minimum temperature of Dhaka, capital of Bangladesh. The trend of temperature all over the Bangladesh has been studied over last sixty years. An Artificial Neural Network model based on Multilayer Perceptron concept has been developed and trained using backpropagation learning algorithm for prediction. The model was tested and trained using ten years of temperature data of Dhaka Station, from Bangladesh Meteorological Department (BMD). The accuracy of the model was calculated on basis of Mean Absolute Percentage Error. The result shows that Neural Network can be used for temperature prediction successfully.","doi":"10.1109/ICIEV.2012.6317369","startPage":"897","endPage":"902","publicationTitle":"2012 International Conference on Informatics, Electronics & Vision (ICIEV)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIEV.2012.6317369","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6317321","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 International Conference on Informatics, Electronics & Vision (ICIEV)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6309279/6317321/06317369.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Artificial neural network based temperature prediction and its impact on solar cell","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6317369/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Artificial neural network based temperature prediction and its impact on solar cell","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6317369/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"13058437","publicationDate":"May 2012","dateOfInsertion":"04 October 2012","conferenceDate":"18-19 May 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-19 May 2012","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Artificial neural network based temperature prediction and its impact on solar cell","confLoc":"Dhaka, Bangladesh","sourcePdf":"218.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064085S","chronDate":"18-19 May 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6309279","isNumber":"6317321","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6309279","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6317321","articleId":"6317369","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-17"},{"_id":6317389,"authors":[{"name":"S.

Researchers use various techniques for detecting accurate location of exons. A digital filter model has been proposed in this paper for the prediction of exons in DNA sequence. The technique involves conversion of DNA character string into a numerical sequence using weak-strong bonding of nucleotides and filtering the transformed sequence using Narrow Band Pass FIR filter whose passband is centered at 2\u03c0/3. The filtered signal power of Narrow band pass FIR filter is then used as a measure parameter for both exons and introns. A plot of signal power versus nucleotide location is used to distinguish exons from introns of a DNA sequence. The simulation plots show very distinct peaks in exon regions indicating its presence where as such peaks are absent in intron regions. The design model is tested for several databases of Homo sapiens Beta-globin chromosome which have been downloaded from National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) homepage.","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 International Conference on Informatics, Electronics & Vision (ICIEV)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6309279/6317321/06317389.pdf","startPage":"12","endPage":"16","publicationTitle":"2012 International Conference on Informatics, Electronics & Vision (ICIEV)","doi":"10.1109/ICIEV.2012.6317389","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIEV.2012.6317389","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6317321","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6317389","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Prediction of protein coding regions of a DNA sequence through spectral analysis","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["DNA","Finite impulse response filter","Band pass filters","Encoding","Genomics","Bioinformatics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["band-pass filters","biology computing","biotechnology","cellular biophysics","DNA","FIR filters","genetics","genomics","molecular biophysics","molecular configurations","proteins","spectral analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["protein coding regions","DNA sequence","spectral analysis","exon prediction","genome","life processes","digital filter model","numerical sequence","weak-strong nucleotide bonding","narrow band pass FIR filter","filtered signal power","introns","Homo sapiens beta-globin chromosome databases","National Center for Biotechnology Information homepage"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Genomics","Amino acids","Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA)","Power Spectral Density","Protein Coding Region","Digital Filter"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6317389/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-19 May 2012","displayDocTitle":"Prediction of protein coding regions of a DNA sequence through spectral analysis","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6317389/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2012","accessionNumber":"13058457","dateOfInsertion":"04 October 2012","conferenceDate":"18-19 May 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Prediction of protein coding regions of a DNA sequence through spectral analysis","confLoc":"Dhaka, Bangladesh","sourcePdf":"260.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052612S","chronDate":"18-19 May 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6309279","isNumber":"6317321","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6309279","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6317321","articleId":"6317389","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6317391,"authors":[{"name":"Vinai Thrivikramaru","affiliation":["Maulana Azad National Institute of Technology, Bhopal, India"],"firstName":"Vinai","lastName":"Thrivikramaru","id":"38243796400"},{"name":"Rajendra Kumar Baghel","affiliation":["Maulana Azad National Institute of Technology, Bhopal, India"],"lastName":"Rajendra Kumar Baghel","id":"37087547558"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1154-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1153-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-1152-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6317391","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1399},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6317391","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["CMOS integrated circuits","Transistors","Switches","CMOS technology","MOSFET circuits","Operational amplifiers","MOS devices"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["circuit simulation","CMOS integrated circuits","differential amplifiers","operational amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive biased operational amplifier","slew-rate","adaptive biased differential amplifier stage","buffer","output signal","alternative biasing scheme","adaptive biasing technique","pulse input","distortion-less output","CMOS process","Cadence Spectre model","UMC model","size 180 nm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Adaptive Biasing","Operational Amplifier","Slew-Rate"]}],"abstract":"The work proposes a novel design of an Operational Amplifier which uses an Adaptive biased Differential Amplifier stage for biasing.

Image fusion can be performed using either spatial or transform domain methods. Limitations of spatial domain fusion methods led to transform domain methods. Discrete wavelet transform (DWT) based fusion is one of the most widely used transform domain method. But it suffers from shift sensitivity and does not provide any phase information. These disadvantages of DWT motivated us to use complex wavelet transform. In the present work, we have proposed a new multimodal medical image fusion method using Daubechies complex wavelet transform (DCxWT) which applies two separate fusion rules for approximation and detail coefficients. Shift invariance, availability of phase information and multiscale edge information properties of DCxWT improves the quality of fused image. We have compared the proposed method with spatial domain fusion methods (PCA and linear fusion) and transform domain fusion methods (discrete and lifting wavelet transforms). Comparison of results has been done qualitatively as well as by using different fusion metrics (entropy, standard deviation, fusion factor, fusion symmetry and Q\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">AB</sub>\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">F</sup>\n).

Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) driven Software Define Radio (SDR) device senses the status of a spectrum availability and assign to the CR users without less interference. Carrier-Interferometry OFDM (CI/OFDM) based SDR had been proposed recently to reduce interference among the SDR users. In this paper, CI/OFDM based SDR has been used in CR system to assign the licensed spectrum to secondary users under certain restriction with less interference with the licensed spectrum. The user detection probability and miss detection probability of the proposed SDR device has been also derived in this paper. We have numerically calculated the detection probability and interference corresponding to the threshold value and, the result shows that the overall user detection probability of the proposed SDR is higher than the traditional SDR terminals. The proposed CI/OFDM SDR also detect any target frequency spectrum by searching CI-codes along with frequency band, modulation etc. of the transmitted signal.","doi":"10.1109/ICIEV.2012.6317413","publicationTitle":"2012 International Conference on Informatics, Electronics & Vision (ICIEV)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 International Conference on Informatics, Electronics & Vision (ICIEV)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6309279/6317321/06317413.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIEV.2012.6317413","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6317321","startPage":"258","endPage":"262","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spectrum sensing approach of CI/OFDM based software defined radio transceiver in Cognitive Radio (CR)","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6317413","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Spectrum sensing approach of CI/OFDM based software defined radio transceiver in Cognitive Radio (CR)","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-19 May 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6317413/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"18-19 May 2012","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2012","accessionNumber":"13058481","dateOfInsertion":"04 October 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6317413/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spectrum sensing approach of CI/OFDM based software defined radio transceiver in Cognitive Radio (CR)","confLoc":"Dhaka, Bangladesh","sourcePdf":"317.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072161S","chronDate":"18-19 May 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6309279","isNumber":"6317321","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6309279","xplore-issue":"6317321","articleId":"6317413","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6317415,"authors":[{"name":"Sazzad Bin Kamal","affiliation":["Department of CSE, University of Information Technology and Sciences, Dhaka, Bangladesh"],"lastName":"Sazzad Bin Kamal","id":"38489633500"},{"name":"Muhammad Golam Kibria","affiliation":["Department of CSE, University of Information Technology and Sciences, Dhaka, Bangladesh"],"lastName":"Muhammad Golam Kibria","id":"38489562500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1154-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1153-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-1152-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6317415","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":71},"abstract":"Degree Constrained Minimum Spanning Tree (d-MST), is a well studied NP-hard problem.

In OFDM, the spectrum of individual orthogonal subcarriers mutually overlaps, giving therefore an optimum spectrum efficiency. A data communications system based on OFDM is particularly sensitive to frequency offset in the channel. Frequency offset is a phenomena, which causes phase shift and hence, reduction in signal strength at the output of the filters matched to each of the carriers and introduces ICI from other carriers which are now no longer orthogonal to the filter. In OFDM the carriers are inherently closely spaced in frequency compared to the channel bandwidth, the tolerable frequency offset becomes a very small fraction of the channel bandwidth. This paper is based on the study and comparison of algorithms that estimate the carrier and sampling frequency offsets from the demodulated data signals in the receiver. An implementation of these techniques to correct the respective offsets along with the performance of these algorithms, via simulation, is also presented.","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 International Conference on Informatics, Electronics & Vision (ICIEV)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6309279/6317321/06317427.pdf","startPage":"391","endPage":"396","publicationTitle":"2012 International Conference on Informatics, Electronics & Vision (ICIEV)","doi":"10.1109/ICIEV.2012.6317427","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIEV.2012.6317427","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6317321","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6317427","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Frequency synchronization algorithms for 802.11n based MIMO-OFDM systems: A performance analysis","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","AWGN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO communication","OFDM modulation","radio receivers","synchronisation","telecommunication standards","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frequency synchronization algorithm","IEEE 802.11n","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","MIMO-OFDM systems","performance analysis","signaling scheme","digital communications","data communications system","optimum spectrum efficiency","phase shift","signal strength","channel bandwidth","sampling frequency offsets"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","Multiple input-Multiple output systems","802.11n","carrier frequency offset","frequency synchronization"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6317427/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-19 May 2012","displayDocTitle":"Frequency synchronization algorithms for 802.11n based MIMO-OFDM systems: A performance analysis","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6317427/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2012","accessionNumber":"13058495","dateOfInsertion":"04 October 2012","conferenceDate":"18-19 May 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Frequency synchronization algorithms for 802.11n based MIMO-OFDM systems: A performance analysis","confLoc":"Dhaka, Bangladesh","sourcePdf":"339.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042995S","chronDate":"18-19 May 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6309279","isNumber":"6317321","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6309279","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6317321","articleId":"6317427","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6317430,"authors":[{"name":"Tahidul Islam","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, University of Ulsan, Ulsan, South Korea"],"firstName":"Tahidul","lastName":"Islam","id":"38490141100"},{"name":"Insoo Koo","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, University of Ulsan, Ulsan, South Korea"],"firstName":"Insoo","lastName":"Koo","id":"37275759800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1154-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1153-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-1152-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6317430","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":456},"abstract":"Compressed Sensing is a novel theory that has been playing a significant role in the area of image processing, signal processing, wireless communication and sensor networks etc. As the signals in wireless sensor networks are sparse as compared with the number of nodes, therefore compressed sensing method is adaptive for data transmission among sensor nodes.

We have proved by experiment and analysis that probabilistic neural network is best suited to deal with signature recognition problem with an average of 100% accuracy.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-19 May 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6317435/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"13058503","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6317435/","publicationDate":"May 2012","dateOfInsertion":"04 October 2012","conferenceDate":"18-19 May 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A comparative study of signature recognition problem using statistical features and artificial neural networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A comparative study of signature recognition problem using statistical features and artificial neural networks","confLoc":"Dhaka, Bangladesh","sourcePdf":"347.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050999S","chronDate":"18-19 May 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6309279","isNumber":"6317321","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6309279","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6317321","articleId":"6317435","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6317437,"authors":[{"name":"Tajrian Izma","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering (EEE), BRAe University, Dhaka, Bangladesh","Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering (EEE), BRAC University, Dhaka, Bangladesh"],"firstName":"Tajrian","lastName":"Izma","id":"38489756900"},{"name":"Parag Barua","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering (EEE), BRAe University, Dhaka, Bangladesh","Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering (EEE), BRAC University, Dhaka, Bangladesh"],"firstName":"Parag","lastName":"Barua","id":"38489005500"},{"name":"Md.

The combination of higher clock speeds, greater functional integration, and smaller process geometries has contributed to significant growth in power density. Scaling improves transistor density and functionality on a chip. Scaling helps to increase speed and frequency of operation and hence higher performance. As voltages scale downward with the geometries threshold voltages must also decrease to gain the performance advantages of the new technology but leakage current increases exponentially. Thinner gate oxides have led to an increase in gate leakage current. Today leakage power has become an increasingly important issue in processor hardware and software design. With the main component of leakage, the sub-threshold current, exponentially increasing with decreasing device dimensions, leakage commands an ever increasing share in the processor power consumption. In 65 nm and below technologies, leakage accounts for 30-40% of processor power. According to the International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors (ITRS) [1], leakage power dissipation may eventually dominate total power consumption as technology feature sizes shrink. While there are several process technology and circuit-level solutions to reduce leakage in processors, we propose novel approaches for reducing both leakage and dynamic power with minimum possible area and delay trade off.","doi":"10.1109/ICIEV.2012.6317437","publicationTitle":"2012 International Conference on Informatics, Electronics & Vision (ICIEV)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 International Conference on Informatics, Electronics & Vision (ICIEV)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6309279/6317321/06317437.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIEV.2012.6317437","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6317321","startPage":"316","endPage":"319","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Novel approaches to low leakage and area efficient VLSI design","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6317437","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Novel approaches to low leakage and area efficient VLSI design","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-19 May 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6317437/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"18-19 May 2012","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2012","accessionNumber":"13058505","dateOfInsertion":"04 October 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6317437/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Novel approaches to low leakage and area efficient VLSI design","confLoc":"Dhaka, Bangladesh","sourcePdf":"349.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.084101S","chronDate":"18-19 May 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6309279","isNumber":"6317321","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6309279","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6317321","articleId":"6317437","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6317439,"authors":[{"name":"Sheikh Faisal Miskhat","affiliation":["EECS, North South University, Dhaka, Bangladesh"],"firstName":"Sheikh Faisal","lastName":"Miskhat","id":"38489478800"},{"name":"Mahmud Ridwan","affiliation":["EECS, North South University, Dhaka, Bangladesh"],"firstName":"Mahmud","lastName":"Ridwan","id":"38242195700"},{"name":"Ehtesham Chowdhury","affiliation":["EECS, North South University, Dhaka, Bangladesh"],"firstName":"Ehtesham","lastName":"Chowdhury","id":"38490434600"},{"name":"Saami Rahman","affiliation":["EECS, North South University, Dhaka, Bangladesh"],"firstName":"Saami","lastName":"Rahman","id":"37085659928"},{"name":"M.

Thus, the proposed method ensures a good balance in the fidelity of the watermarked image and the quality of the restored image.","doi":"10.1109/ICIEV.2012.6317509","publicationTitle":"2012 International Conference on Informatics, Electronics & Vision (ICIEV)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 International Conference on Informatics, Electronics & Vision (ICIEV)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6309279/6317321/06317509.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIEV.2012.6317509","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6317321","startPage":"1163","endPage":"1167","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Digital watermarking based image authentication and restoration by quantization of integer wavelet transform coefficients","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6317509","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Digital watermarking based image authentication and restoration by quantization of integer wavelet transform coefficients","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-19 May 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6317509/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"18-19 May 2012","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2012","accessionNumber":"13058576","dateOfInsertion":"04 October 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6317509/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Digital watermarking based image authentication and restoration by quantization of integer wavelet transform coefficients","confLoc":"Dhaka, Bangladesh","sourcePdf":"476.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.107128S","chronDate":"18-19 May 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6309279","isNumber":"6317321","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6309279","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6317321","articleId":"6317509","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6317510,"authors":[{"name":"S Razia","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, North South University, Dhaka, Bangladesh"],"firstName":"S","lastName":"Razia","id":"38488988600"},{"name":"T Hossain","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, North South University, Dhaka, Bangladesh"],"firstName":"T","lastName":"Hossain","id":"38490202700"},{"name":"M A Matin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Institut Teknologi Brunei Brunei Darussalam, Brazil"],"firstName":"M A","lastName":"Matin","id":"37397341200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1154-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1153-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-1152-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6317510","dbTime":"29 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":544},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6317510","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Convergence","Antennas","Equations","Least squares approximation","Mobile communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive antenna arrays","array signal processing","least mean squares methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive array antenna systems","robust smart antenna system","adaptive beamforming","performance analysis","radar applications","communications applications","steepest descent method","computational simplicity","active tap detection-normalized least mean square","ATD-NLMS","convergence rate"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["LMS","NMLS","ATD-NLMS","Beamforming","Smart Antenna"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICIEV.2012.6317510","publicationTitle":"2012 International Conference on Informatics, Electronics & Vision (ICIEV)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 International Conference on Informatics, Electronics & Vision (ICIEV)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6309279/6317321/06317510.pdf","startPage":"946","endPage":"949","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIEV.2012.6317510","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6317321","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance analysis of adaptive beamforming algorithm for smart antenna system","abstract":"Adaptive array antenna systems are currently the subject of intense research interest for radar and communications applications. In addition, algorithms that follow the steepest descent method for adaptive beamforming are widely used in practice and popular for their computational simplicity. In this paper, the authors investigate the Least Mean Square (LMS) and Normalized Least Mean Square (NLMS) algorithms and proposea new scheme to overcome the shortcomings of existing algorithms for a robust smart antenna system. Simulations demonstrate that Active Tap Detection-Normalized Least Mean Square (ATD-NLMS) has the highest convergence rate as it estimates only the active taps for the beamformer. The beamwidth is significantly narrower with higher gain and almost no side lobes in comparison to the other two existing algorithms which lead to a better system efficiency of smart antenna system.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"18-19 May 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6317510/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"13058577","publicationDate":"May 2012","conferenceDate":"18-19 May 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6317510/","dateOfInsertion":"04 October 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Performance analysis of adaptive beamforming algorithm for smart antenna system","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance analysis of adaptive beamforming algorithm for smart antenna system","confLoc":"Dhaka, Bangladesh","sourcePdf":"479.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059571S","chronDate":"18-19 May 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6309279","isNumber":"6317321","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6309279","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6317321","articleId":"6317510","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6317519,"authors":[{"name":"Mohammad Abu Hanif","affiliation":["Division of Electronics and Information Engineering, Chonbuk National University of Korea, Jeonju, South Korea"],"firstName":"Mohammad","lastName":"Abu Hanif","id":"38490208000"},{"name":"Moon Ho Lee","affiliation":["Division of Electronics and Information Engineering, Chonbuk National University of Korea, Jeonju, South Korea"],"firstName":"Moon Ho","lastName":"Lee","id":"37279700800"},{"name":"TaeChol Shin","affiliation":["Division of Electronics and Information Engineering, Chonbuk National University of Korea, Jeonju, South Korea"],"firstName":"TaeChol","lastName":"Shin","id":"37826927100"},{"name":"A.

In the conventional MC-CDMA system, users are affected by MUI (multi-user experience) because all users use whole bandwidth. By the MUI, performance is degraded as the number of user increases. Furthermore, number of maximum user is limited to the length of spreading code. However, proposed system can increase the system performance by limiting MUI through assigning the users to the block-unit sub-carrier. And user capacity of the proposed system is much better than conventional system because spreading code can be reused in each block.

Many arc-fault circuit interrupter (AFCI) devices are currently being listed and entering the market. Depending on the manufacturer, AFCIs are being deployed at the module-level, string-level, or array-level. Each arc-fault protection scheme has a different cost and arc-fault isolation capability. Module-level and string-level AFCI devices tout the ability to isolate the fault, identify the failed PV component, and minimize the power loss by selectively de-energizing a portion of the array. However, these benefits are negated if the arcing noise-typically used for arc-fault detection-propagates to parallel, unfaulted strings and cause additional AFCI devices on the PV array to trip. If the arcing signature \u201ccrosstalks\u201d from the string with the arc-fault via conduction or RF electromagnetic coupling, the location of the arc-fault cannot be easily determined and safe PV generators will be disconnected. Sandia National Laboratories collaborated with Texas Instruments to perform a series of nuisance trip scenarios with different PV configurations. Experimental results on a 2-string array showed arc detection on the faulted string occurred an average of 19.5 ms before unfaulted string-but in some cases the AFCI on both strings would trip.","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 38th IEEE Photovoltaic Specialists Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/6304846/6317554/06317857.pdf","startPage":"001383","endPage":"001387","publicationTitle":"2012 38th IEEE Photovoltaic Specialists Conference","doi":"10.1109/PVSC.2012.6317857","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PVSC.2012.6317857","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6317554","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6317857","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Crosstalk nuisance trip testing of photovoltaic DC arc-fault detectors","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Detectors","Switches","Electromagnetics","Arrays","Indexes","Power systems","Couplings"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["arcs (electric)","crosstalk","fault current limiters","fault diagnosis","photovoltaic power systems","safety devices"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["crosstalk nuisance trip testing","photovoltaic DC arc-fault detectors","PV systems","fire safety","2011-National Electrical Code Article 690.11","NEC","photovoltaic systems","arc-fault protection device","arc-fault circuit interrupter devices","AFCI devices","arc-fault isolation","string-level AFCI devices","module-level AFCI devices","power loss","arcing noise","PV array","crosstalk arcing signature","RF electromagnetic coupling"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["photovoltaic systems","arc-fault detection","series arc-faults","monitoring","power system safety","RF coupling"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6317857/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-8 June 2012","displayDocTitle":"Crosstalk nuisance trip testing of photovoltaic DC arc-fault detectors","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6317857/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2012","accessionNumber":"13055386","dateOfInsertion":"04 October 2012","conferenceDate":"3-8 June 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Crosstalk nuisance trip testing of photovoltaic DC arc-fault detectors","confLoc":"Austin, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"381.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044525S","chronDate":"3-8 June 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6304846","isNumber":"6317554","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6304846","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"6317554","articleId":"6317857","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6317863,"authors":[{"name":"Damla Ickilli","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, Firat University, Elazig, Turkey"],"firstName":"Damla","lastName":"Ickilli","id":"38474866400"},{"name":"Hayrettin Can","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, Firat University, Elazig, Turkey"],"firstName":"Hayrettin","lastName":"Can","id":"38080250800"},{"name":"Koray S.

It can prevent the further degradation of insulation and avoid major breakdown of High voltage apparatus.","doi":"10.1109/ICPADM.2012.6318906","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 10th International Conference on the Properties and Applications of Dielectric Materials","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 10th International Conference on the Properties and Applications of Dielectric Materials","pdfPath":"/iel5/6306340/6318894/06318906.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICPADM.2012.6318906","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6318894","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Denoising and pattern recognition of Partial Discharges in an insulator using wavelet transform","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6318906","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 July 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6318906/","displayDocTitle":"Denoising and pattern recognition of Partial Discharges in an insulator using wavelet transform","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2012","accessionNumber":"13057815","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6318906/","conferenceDate":"24-28 July 2012","dateOfInsertion":"04 October 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Denoising and pattern recognition of Partial Discharges in an insulator using wavelet transform","confLoc":"Bangalore, India","sourcePdf":"125.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071073S","chronDate":"24-28 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6306340","isNumber":"6318894","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6306340","xplore-issue":"6318894","articleId":"6318906","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6318975,"authors":[{"name":"A.

It experiences thermal and electrical stresses during its operation. The insulation system consisting of mineral oil and the insulation paper used in transformer undergoes chemical changes under these stresses and gases are generated. These gases dissolve in oil. The extracted dissolved gases are analysed in the laboratory using gas chromatograph. The fault identifications in a transformer are based on certain key- gas ratios. International standards such as IEEE and ASTM are in use for fault identification. However, these standards are not able to diagnose the fault under certain conditions. Hence, there is a need to improve the diagnostic accuracy. In this paper an attempt has been made to diagnose the faults in a power transformer using a three level perceptron network. Three types of neural network simulation models are developed using MATLAB\u2122 Software and trained using the IEC TC 10 databases of faulty equipments inspected in service. The outputs of the Neural Network models are compared with the IEEE and ASTM methods. The comparison of the results indicates that the condition assessments offered by the models are capable of predicting the fault with higher success rate than the conventional diagnostic methods.","doi":"10.1109/ICPADM.2012.6318975","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 10th International Conference on the Properties and Applications of Dielectric Materials","pdfPath":"/iel5/6306340/6318894/06318975.pdf","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 10th International Conference on the Properties and Applications of Dielectric Materials","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICPADM.2012.6318975","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6318894","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Application of neural networks for transformer fault diagnosis","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Noise measurement","Neural networks","MATLAB","IEC","Reliability","Training","Vectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["condition monitoring","IEEE standards","multilayer perceptrons","power engineering computing","power transformers","thermal stresses","transformer insulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural networks","transformer fault diagnosis","power transformer","power system","electrical stresses","thermal stresses","insulation system","insulation paper","extracted dissolved gases","IEEE","ASTM","international standards","three level perceptron network","MATLABTM Software","IEC TC 10 databases","condition assessments","fault diagnostic methods"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["ASTM","IEEE","IEC TC 10 databases","MATLABTM","Neural Networks","Transformer Fault Diagnosis"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6318975/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 July 2012","displayDocTitle":"Application of neural networks for transformer fault diagnosis","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6318975/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2012","dateOfInsertion":"04 October 2012","conferenceDate":"24-28 July 2012","accessionNumber":"13057883","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Application of neural networks for transformer fault diagnosis","confLoc":"Bangalore, India","sourcePdf":"2711.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.032113S","chronDate":"24-28 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6306340","isNumber":"6318894","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6306340","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6318894","articleId":"6318975","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6319053,"authors":[{"name":"Santiago P.

Because the majority of rotor side control strategies do not include the rotor current, in this work it proposes one which is based on the states feedback in order to provide the rotor current control enclosure. The strategy consists in state space modeling of DFIG connected to the grid. The system is linearized for several operation conditions and, from that, feedback gain matrices are computed, one for each condition. The design is done using the genetic algorithms (GA) technique. Thus, it obtains a set of matrices which constitute a nonlinear controller. A gain scheduling mechanism is responsible for the choice of the suitable matrix, what is done from the system condition identification. Transient stability (TS) simulations have been carried out and the results show that the proposed controller makes possible the stabilization, for unstable systems, or stability improvement to a little stable systems. Thus, the transient behavior of the DFIG is improved, inclusively for the rotor current. Besides, it noticed that the gain scheduling makes the controller adaptive, since it showed itself effective for several system conditions.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 Sept. 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6319116/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"13058764","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6319116/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"04 October 2012","conferenceDate":"3-5 Sept. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"DFIG rotor side control through gain-scheduling designed by genetic algorithm","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"DFIG rotor side control through gain-scheduling designed by genetic algorithm","confLoc":"Montevideo, Uruguay","sourcePdf":"PID282.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068516S","chronDate":"3-5 Sept. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6309333","isNumber":"6319035","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6309333","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6319035","articleId":"6319116","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":6319162,"authors":[{"name":"Jing Mei","affiliation":["National Supercomputing Center in Changsha, College of Information Science and Engineering, Hunan University, Changsha, Hunan, China"],"firstName":"Jing","lastName":"Mei","id":"38492614200"},{"name":"Kenli Li","affiliation":["National Supercomputing Center in Changsha, College of Information Science and Engineering, Hunan University, Changsha, Hunan, China"],"firstName":"Kenli","lastName":"Li","id":"38540610000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2901-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2152-1093"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2152-1085"}],"articleNumber":"6319162","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":23,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":564},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy-Aware Scheduling Algorithm with Duplication on Heterogeneous Computing Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Program processors","Energy consumption","Schedules","Algorithm design and analysis","Clustering algorithms","Scheduling algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed processing","environmental factors","power aware computing","scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy-aware scheduling algorithm","heterogeneous computing systems","duplication-based algorithm","green computing system","energy conservation","dynamic voltage/frequcny scaling","DVFS","energy aware scheduling by minimizing duplication","EAMD"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["energy aware","DAG","static scheduling","duplication-based","heterogeneous"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6319162","abstract":"Efficient application scheduling is critical for achieving high performance in heterogeneous computing (HC) environments. Because of its importance, there are many researches on this problem and various algorithms have been proposed. Duplication-based algorithm is a kind of famous algorithm to solve scheduling problem, which achieve high performance on minimizing the overall completion time(makespan) of applications. However, they do not consider energy consumption. With the growing advocacy for green computing system, energy conservation has been an important issue and gained a particular interest. An existing technique to reduce energy consumption of application is dynamic voltage/frequcny scaling(DVFS), but its efficiency is affected by the overhead of time and energy caused by voltage scaling. In this paper, we propose a new energy-aware scheduling algorithm called Energy Aware Scheduling by Minimizing Duplication(EAMD), which considers the energy consumption as well as the makespan of applications. It adopts a subtle energy-aware method to determine and delete the abundant task copies in the schedules generated by duplication-based algorithms, which is easier to operate than DVFS and produces no extra time and energy consumption. This algorithm can reduce large amount of energy consumption while having the same makespan compared with duplication-based algorithms without energy awareness. Randomly generated DAGs are tested in our experiments. Experimental results show that EAMD can save up to 15.59% energy consumption for the existed duplication-based algorithms. Several factors affecting the performance are analyzed in the paper, too.","doi":"10.1109/Grid.2012.32","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 ACM/IEEE 13th International Conference on Grid Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/6317268/6319148/06319162.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/Grid.2012.32","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6319148","publicationTitle":"2012 ACM/IEEE 13th International Conference on Grid Computing","startPage":"122","endPage":"129","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"20-23 Sept. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Energy-Aware Scheduling Algorithm with Duplication on Heterogeneous Computing Systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6319162/","dateOfInsertion":"04 October 2012","accessionNumber":"13038105","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6319162/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 Sept. 2012","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy-Aware Scheduling Algorithm with Duplication on Heterogeneous Computing Systems","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"4815a122.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.097416S","chronDate":"20-23 Sept. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6317268","isNumber":"6319148","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6317268","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"6319148","articleId":"6319162","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6319170,"authors":[{"name":"Guofu Feng","affiliation":["School of Information Science, Nanjing Audit University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Guofu","lastName":"Feng","id":"37600317400"},{"name":"Saurabh Garg","affiliation":["Department of Computing and Information Systems, CloudShield Technologies, Melbourne, Australia"],"firstName":"Saurabh","lastName":"Garg","id":"37652310100"},{"name":"Rajkumar Buyya","affiliation":["Department of Computing and Information Systems, CloudShield Technologies, Melbourne, Australia"],"firstName":"Rajkumar","lastName":"Buyya","id":"37267557900"},{"name":"Wenzhong Li","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory for Novel Software Technology, Nanjing University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Wenzhong","lastName":"Li","id":"37537032500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2901-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2152-1093"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2152-1085"}],"articleNumber":"6319170","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":30,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":550},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Time factors","Servers","Pricing","Mathematical model","Resource management","Virtual machining","Cloud computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","quality of service","queueing theory","resource allocation","service-oriented architecture","software metrics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["revenue maximization","adaptive resource provisioning","cloud computing environments","grid computing","cluster computing","traditional computing models","cloud providers","pooled computing resource allocation","customer-oriented service metrics","operating level metrics","service level agreement","SLA-based dynamic resource allocation","queuing theory","quality of service parameters","QoS","arrival rates","service rates","traced dataset"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cloud Computing","Service Level Agreement","Resource Allocation"]}],"abstract":"Compared with the traditional computing models such as grid computing and cluster computing, a key advantage of Cloud computing is that it provides a practical business model for customers to use remote resources. However, it is challenging for Cloud providers to allocate the pooled computing resources dynamically among the differentiated customers so as to maximize their revenue. It is not an easy task to transform the customer-oriented service metrics into operating level metrics, and control the Cloud resources adaptively based on Service Level Agreement (SLA). This paper addresses the problem of maximizing the provider's revenue through SLA-based dynamic resource allocation as SLA plays a vital role in Cloud computing to bridge service providers and customers. We formalize the resource allocation problem using Queuing Theory and propose optimal solutions for the problem considering various Quality of Service (QoS) parameters such as pricing mechanisms, arrival rates, service rates and available resources. The experimental results, both with the synthetic dataset and with traced dadataset, show that our algorithms outperform related work.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Revenue Maximization Using Adaptive Resource Provisioning in Cloud Computing Environments","publicationTitle":"2012 ACM/IEEE 13th International Conference on Grid Computing","doi":"10.1109/Grid.2012.16","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 ACM/IEEE 13th International Conference on Grid Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/6317268/6319148/06319170.pdf","startPage":"192","endPage":"200","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/Grid.2012.16","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6319148","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6319170","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6319170/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 Sept. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Revenue Maximization Using Adaptive Resource Provisioning in Cloud Computing Environments","conferenceDate":"20-23 Sept. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6319170/","dateOfInsertion":"04 October 2012","publicationDate":"Sept. 2012","accessionNumber":"13038113","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Revenue Maximization Using Adaptive Resource Provisioning in Cloud Computing Environments","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"4815a192.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.120911S","chronDate":"20-23 Sept. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6317268","isNumber":"6319148","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6317268","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"6319148","articleId":"6319170","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":6319189,"authors":[{"name":"Rahul Sridharan","affiliation":["NSF Center for High-Performance Reconfigurable Computing, Department of ECE, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA"],"firstName":"Rahul","lastName":"Sridharan","id":"38489181800"},{"name":"Gregg Cooke","affiliation":["Global CTO Applied Innovation Team, Chicago, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Gregg","lastName":"Cooke","id":"38489497700"},{"name":"Kenneth Hill","affiliation":["NSF Center for High-Performance Reconfigurable Computing, Department of ECE, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA"],"firstName":"Kenneth","lastName":"Hill","id":"38490059300"},{"name":"Herman Lam","affiliation":["NSF Center for High-Performance Reconfigurable Computing, Department of ECE, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA"],"firstName":"Herman","lastName":"Lam","id":"37270809500"},{"name":"Alan George","affiliation":["NSF Center for High-Performance Reconfigurable Computing, Department of ECE, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA"],"firstName":"Alan","lastName":"George","id":"37279801000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-4838-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2882-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-515X"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-5133"}],"articleNumber":"6319189","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":14,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":327},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Mathematical model","Computational modeling","Field programmable gate arrays","Contracts","Monte Carlo methods","Pricing","Computer architecture"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","contracts","field programmable gate arrays","Monte Carlo methods","multiprocessing systems","pricing","reconfigurable architectures","stock markets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FPGA-based reconfigurable computing","multiasset barrier options pricing","multiasset barrier contracts","path-dependent exotic options","mathematical complexity","Monte Carlo methods","O(n-1/2) convergence rate","FPGA-based accelerated system architecture","MC core","Heston core","full truncation Euler discretization method","Novo-G","reconfigurable supercomputer housed","NSF Center for High-Performance Reconfigurable Computing","CHREC","University of Florida"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["FPGA-based reconfigurable computing","option-pricing","Multi-asset Heston model","Monte Carlo simulation"]}],"abstract":"Multi-asset barrier contracts are path-dependent exotic options consisting of two or more underlying assets. As the dimensions of an option increase, so does the mathematical complexity of a closed form solution. Monte Carlo (MC) methods offer an attractive solution under such conditions. MC methods have an O(n-1/2) convergence rate irrespective of the dimension of the integral. However, such methods using conventional computing with CPUs are not scalable enough to enable banks to realize the potential that these exotic options promise. This paper presents an FPGA-based accelerated system architecture to price multi-asset barrier contracts. The architecture consists of a parallel set of Monte Carlo cores, each capable of simulating multiple Monte Carlo paths. Each MC core is designed to be customizable so that the core for the model (i.e., \"model\" core) can be easily replaced. In our current design, a Heston core based on the full truncation Euler discretization method is used as the model core. Similarly, we can use different payoff calculator kernels to compute various payoffs such as vanilla portfolios, barriers, look-backs, etc. The design leverages an early termination condition of \"out\" barrier options to efficiently schedule MC paths across multiple cores in a single FPGA and across multiple FPGAs. The target platform for our design is Novo-G, a reconfigurable supercomputer housed at the NSF Center for High-Performance Reconfigurable Computing (CHREC), University of Florida. Our design is validated for the single-asset configuration by comparing our output to option prices calculated analytically and achieves an average speedup of ranging from 123 to 350 on one FPGA as we vary the number of underlying assets from 32 down to 4. For a configuration with 16 underlying assets, the speedup achieved is 7134 when scaled to 48 FPGAs as compared to a single-threaded version of an SSE2-optimized C program running on a single Intel Sandy Bridge E5-2687 core at 3.1 GHz with hyper-threading turned on. Finally, the techniques described in this paper can be applied to other exotic multi-asset option classes, such as look backs, rainbows, and Asian-style options.","publicationTitle":"2012 Symposium on Application Accelerators in High Performance Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 Symposium on Application Accelerators in High Performance Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/6317269/6319184/06319189.pdf","startPage":"34","endPage":"43","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FPGA-Based Reconfigurable Computing for Pricing Multi-asset Barrier Options","doi":"10.1109/SAAHPC.2012.21","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6319184","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SAAHPC.2012.21","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6319189","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6319189/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-11 July 2012","displayDocTitle":"FPGA-Based Reconfigurable Computing for Pricing Multi-asset Barrier Options","dateOfInsertion":"04 October 2012","publicationDate":"July 2012","accessionNumber":"13038589","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"10-11 July 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6319189/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FPGA-Based Reconfigurable Computing for Pricing Multi-asset Barrier Options","confLoc":"Argonne, IL, USA","sourcePdf":"4838a034.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.097585S","chronDate":"10-11 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6317269","isNumber":"6319184","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6317269","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"6319184","articleId":"6319189","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6319194,"authors":[{"name":"Elliott Brossard","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA"],"firstName":"Elliott","lastName":"Brossard","id":"38489995700"},{"name":"Dustin Richmond","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA"],"firstName":"Dustin","lastName":"Richmond","id":"37856284000"},{"name":"Joshua Green","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA"],"firstName":"Joshua","lastName":"Green","id":"38236216100"},{"name":"Carl Ebeling","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA"],"firstName":"Carl","lastName":"Ebeling","id":"37284732400"},{"name":"Larry Ruzzo","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA"],"firstName":"Larry","lastName":"Ruzzo","id":"38490344900"},{"name":"Corey Olson","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA"],"firstName":"Corey","lastName":"Olson","id":"38263096400"},{"name":"Scott Hauck","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA"],"firstName":"Scott","lastName":"Hauck","id":"37265522000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-4838-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2882-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-515X"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-5133"}],"articleNumber":"6319194","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":211},"abstract":"Genomics computing is indispensable in basic medical research as well as in practical applications such as disease prevention, pharmaceutical development, and criminal forensics. DNA sequencing, assembly and analysis are key components of genomics computing. Coupled with the increased use of computation for both synthesis and analysis of data in genomics is the astounding increase in the rate at which next-generation sequencing platforms are producing genomic data. Keeping up with the combination of increasing levels of algorithmic demands and an exponential increase in data represents a huge computational challenge that requires a corresponding revolution in how we process the data. Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) are particularly well suited to the type of highly parallel, bit-level computations found in genomics algorithms. Unfortunately, the use of FPGA platforms among genomics researchers has been limited by the specialized hardware design expertise currently required to use these platforms. Another limiting factor has been a proliferation of FPGA platform architectures, each generally requiring a re-implementation of the algorithm. This paper describes a new programming model called Elan and an associated compiler that we are developing for FPGA-based genomic applications. The Elan model and compiler allow a programmer to use familiar concepts from parallel and distributed computing to develop an application at a relatively high level of abstraction, which can then be compiled automatically to large-scale FPGA platforms. One of the goals of Elan is to allow an application to be run seamlessly across both the CPU and FPGA portions of a platform, and to be parallelized easily across a system comprising many FPGAs and CPUs. We use the short read alignment application as the motivating example.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bioinformatics","Genomics","Hardware","Field programmable gate

tandem mass spectrometry data generated from protein fragments has become the dominant method for the identification and classification of unknown protein samples. With wide ranging application in numerous scientific disciplines such as pharmaceutical research, cancer diagnostics, and bacterial identification, the need for accurate protein identification remains important, and the ability to produce more accurate identifications at faster rates would be of great benefit to society as a whole. As a key step towards improving the speed, and thus achievable accuracy, of protein identification algorithms, this paper presents a FPGA-based solution that considerably accelerates the Isotope Pattern Calculator, a computationally intense subroutine common in de novo protein identification. Although previous work shows incremental progress in the acceleration of software-based IPC (mainly by sacrificing accuracy for speed), to the best of our knowledge this is the first work to consider IPC on FPGAs. In this paper, we describe the design and implementation of an efficient and configurable IPC kernel. The described design provides 23 customization parameters allowing for general use within many protein identification algorithms. We discuss several parameter tradeoffs and demonstrate experimentally their effect on performance when comparing execution of optimized IPC software with various configurations of our hardware IPC solution, we demonstrate between 72 and 566 speedup on a single Stratix IV E530 FPGA. Finally, a favorable IPC configuration is scaled to multiple FPGAs, where a best-case speedup of 3340 on 16 FPGAs is observed when experimentally evaluated on a single node of Novo-G, the reconfigurable supercomputer in the NSF CHREC Center at Florida.","doi":"10.1109/SAAHPC.2012.9","publicationTitle":"2012 Symposium on Application Accelerators in High Performance Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 Symposium on Application Accelerators in High Performance Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/6317269/6319184/06319197.pdf","startPage":"111","endPage":"120","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6319184","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SAAHPC.2012.9","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FPGA-Accelerated Isotope Pattern Calculator for Use in Simulated Mass Spectrometry Peptide and Protein Chemistry","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6319197/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-11 July 2012","displayDocTitle":"FPGA-Accelerated Isotope Pattern Calculator for Use in Simulated Mass Spectrometry Peptide and Protein Chemistry","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6319197/","dateOfInsertion":"04 October 2012","publicationDate":"July 2012","accessionNumber":"13038597","conferenceDate":"10-11 July 2012","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FPGA-Accelerated Isotope Pattern Calculator for Use in Simulated Mass Spectrometry Peptide and Protein Chemistry","confLoc":"Argonne, IL, USA","sourcePdf":"4838a111.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.117749S","chronDate":"10-11 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6317269","isNumber":"6319184","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6317269","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6319184","articleId":"6319197","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6319203,"authors":[{"name":"Jir\u00ed Filipovic","affiliation":["Masaryk University, Czech Republic"],"firstName":"Jir\u00ed","lastName":"Filipovic","id":"38110820100"},{"name":"Jan Fousek","affiliation":["Masaryk University, Czech Republic"],"firstName":"Jan","lastName":"Fousek","id":"38233616300"},{"name":"Bedrich Lakom\u00fd","affiliation":["Masaryk University, Czech Republic"],"firstName":"Bedrich","lastName":"Lakom\u00fd","id":"38489430300"},{"name":"Mat\u00fa Madzin","affiliation":["Masaryk University, Czech Republic"],"firstName":"Mat\u00fa","lastName":"Madzin","id":"38467933800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-4838-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2882-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-515X"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-5133"}],"articleNumber":"6319203","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":107},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Finite element methods","Kernel","Algorithms","Graphics processing unit","Registers","Assembly","Acceleration"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["finite element analysis","graphics processing units","optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["GPU acceleration optimization","element subroutines","finite element method","FEM model","kernel fusion","optimization technique","St Venant-Kirchhoff material","compiler","hand-tuned implementation","GPU architecture"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["GPGPU","FEM","automatic optimization","fusion"]}],"abstract":"The element subroutines in finite element method (FEM) provides enough parallelism to be successfully accelerated by contemporary GPUs.

In this paper, we propose an approach to leveraging method call anomalies to improve the effectiveness of SFL techniques for locating faulty statements in an object oriented program. First, we compute the suspiciousness for each class based on the difference in its method call sequences between passed and failed runs. Then, we use the suspiciousness information of classes to refine SFL ranks in order to enhance their fault localization effectiveness of object-oriented software. The empirical results show that the proposed approach is able to improve the effectiveness of SFL techniques.","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 12th International Conference on Quality Software","pdfPath":"/iel5/6317270/6319217/06319218.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","publicationTitle":"2012 12th International Conference on Quality Software","doi":"10.1109/QSIC.2012.30","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/QSIC.2012.30","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6319217","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6319218","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Leveraging Method Call Anomalies to Improve the Effectiveness of Spectrum-Based Fault Localization Techniques for Object-Oriented Programs","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Software","Java","Educational institutions","Containers","Bars","Laboratories"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["object-oriented programming","program diagnostics","software fault tolerance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["leveraging method call anomalies","spectrum based fault localization techniques","object-oriented programs","SFL","automated diagnosis technique","diagnostic accuracy","suspiciousness information","object-oriented software"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["fault localization","object-oriented","spectrumbased","method call anomalies"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6319218/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 Aug. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Leveraging Method Call Anomalies to Improve the Effectiveness of Spectrum-Based Fault Localization Techniques for Object-Oriented Programs","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6319218/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2012","accessionNumber":"13038639","dateOfInsertion":"04 October 2012","conferenceDate":"27-29 Aug. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Leveraging Method Call Anomalies to Improve the Effectiveness of Spectrum-Based Fault Localization Techniques for Object-Oriented Programs","confLoc":"Xi'an, China","sourcePdf":"4833a001.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062497S","chronDate":"27-29 Aug. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6317270","isNumber":"6319217","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6317270","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6319217","articleId":"6319218","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6319228,"authors":[{"name":"Muzammil Shahbaz","affiliation":["University of Sheffield, UK"],"firstName":"Muzammil","lastName":"Shahbaz","id":"37942199700"},{"name":"Phil McMinn","affiliation":["University of Sheffield, UK"],"firstName":"Phil","lastName":"McMinn","id":"37391658600"},{"name":"Mark Stevenson","affiliation":["University of Sheffield, UK"],"firstName":"Mark","lastName":"Stevenson","id":"38243903500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2857-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4833-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2332-662X"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-6002"},{"format":"CD","value":"1550-6002"}],"articleNumber":"6319228","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":460},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Electronic mail","Web search","Java","Natural language processing","Web pages","Internet","Search engines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Internet","natural language processing","query processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automated discovery","valid test strings","dynamic regular expressions collation","natural language processing","dynamic symbolic execution","search based testing","branch coverage","string operations","Web search","open source projects","string input validation code","Web queries","email address","string parameter"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["test data generation","string inputs","valid inputs","web queries","regular expressions","natural language processing"]}],"abstract":"Classic approaches to test input generation -- such as dynamic symbolic execution and search-based testing -- are commonly driven by a test adequacy criterion such as branch coverage. However, there is no guarantee that these techniques will generate meaningful and realistic inputs, particularly in the case of string test data. Also, these techniques have trouble handling path conditions involving string operations that are inherently complex in nature. This paper presents a novel approach of finding valid values by collating suitable regular expressions dynamically that validate the format of the string values, such as an email address. The regular expressions are found using web searches that are driven by the identifiers appearing in the program, for example a string parameter called email Address. The identifier names are processed through natural language processing techniques to tailor the web queries. Once a regular expression has been found, a secondary web search is performed for strings matching the regular expression. An empirical study is performed on case studies involving String input validation code from 10 open source projects. Compared to other approaches, the precision of generating valid strings is significantly improved by employing regular expressions and natural language processing techniques.","doi":"10.1109/QSIC.2012.15","publicationTitle":"2012 12th International Conference on Quality Software","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 12th International Conference on Quality Software","pdfPath":"/iel5/6317270/6319217/06319228.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/QSIC.2012.15","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6319217","startPage":"79","endPage":"88","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Automated Discovery of Valid Test Strings from the Web Using Dynamic Regular Expressions Collation and Natural Language Processing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6319228","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Automated Discovery of Valid Test Strings from the Web Using Dynamic Regular Expressions Collation and Natural Language Processing","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 Aug. 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6319228/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"27-29 Aug. 2012","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2012","accessionNumber":"13038649","dateOfInsertion":"04 October 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6319228/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automated Discovery of Valid Test Strings from the Web Using Dynamic Regular Expressions Collation and Natural Language Processing","confLoc":"Xi'an, China","sourcePdf":"4833a079.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062226S","chronDate":"27-29 Aug. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6317270","isNumber":"6319217","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6317270","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6319217","articleId":"6319228","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6319284,"authors":[{"name":"Yang Tang","affiliation":["Department of Transdisciplinary Concepts and Methods, Potsdam Institute of Climate Impact Research, Potsdam, Germany","Research Institute of Intelligent Control and Systems, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China","Institute of Physics, Humboldt-Universit\u00e4t zu Berlin, Berlin, Germany"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8857/6375734/6319284/6319284-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yang Tang (M\u201911) received the BS and PhD degrees in electrical engineering from Donghua University, Shanghai, China, in 2006 and 2011, respectively.

Until now, optimal selection of the set of controlling regions is still an open problem and this paper represents the first attempt to include two measures of controllability into one unified framework. The detection problem of controlling regions in cortical networks is converted into a constrained optimization problem (COP), where the objective function R is minimized and \u03c3 is regarded as a constraint. Then, the detection of controlling regions of a weighted and directed complex network (e.g., a cortical network of a cat), is thoroughly investigated. The controlling regions of cortical networks are successfully detected by means of an improved dynamic hybrid framework (IDyHF). Our experiments verify that the proposed IDyHF outperforms two recently developed evolutionary computation methods in constrained optimization field and some traditional methods in control theory as well as graph theory. Based on the IDyHF, the controlling regions are detected in a microscopic and macroscopic way. Our results unveil the dependence of controlling regions on the number of driver nodes I and the constraint r. The controlling regions are largely selected from the regions with a large in-degree and a small out-degree. When r = + \u221e, there exists a concave shape of the mean degrees of the driver nodes, i.e., the regions with a large degree are of great importance to the control of the networks when I is small and the regions with a small degree are helpful to control the networks when I increases. When r = 0, the mean degrees of the driver nodes increase as a function of I. We find that controlling \u03c3 is becoming more important in controlling a cortical network with increasing I. The methods and results of detecting controlling regions in this paper would promote the coordination and information consensus of various kinds of real-world complex networks including transportation networks, genetic regulatory networks, and social networks, etc.","doi":"10.1109/TCBB.2012.124","pdfPath":"/iel5/8857/6375734/06319284.pdf","startPage":"1569","endPage":"1581","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Computational Biology and Bioinformatics","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Computational Biology and Bioinformatics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCBB.2012.124","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6375734","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Constrained Evolutionary Computation Method for Detecting Controlling Regions of Cortical Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6319284/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.-Dec.  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 October 2012","displayDocTitle":"A Constrained Evolutionary Computation Method for Detecting Controlling Regions of Cortical Networks","volume":"9","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2012","accessionNumber":"13168108","pubMedId":"23221081","publicationDate":"Nov.-Dec. 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6319284/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Constrained Evolutionary Computation Method for Detecting Controlling Regions of Cortical Networks","sourcePdf":"ttb2012061569.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.117896S","chronDate":"Nov.-Dec.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"8857","isNumber":"6375734","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8857","citationCount":"91","xplore-issue":"6375734","articleId":"6319284","onlineDate":"02 October 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6319293,"authors":[{"name":"Kun Fang","affiliation":["Nvidia, Santa Clara, CA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/12/6828816/6319293/6319293-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Kun Fang received the BS and MS degrees in computer science from the Huazhong University of Science of Technology, China, in 2005 and 2007, respectively, and the PhD degree in electrical and computer engineering from the University of Illinois at Chicago in 2013.

As memory data rate, capacity and bandwidth are being pushed higher and higher, the power consumption of memory systems becomes a significant part in the overall system power profile. Conventional memory systems do not provide an efficient mechanism for managing its power and performance tradeoff. We propose a novel mini-rank architecture for DDRx memories to reduce memory power consumption by breaking each DRAM rank into multiple narrow mini-ranks and activating fewer devices for each request. We also propose a heterogeneous mini-rank design to further improve the performance-power tradeoff for each workload based on its memory access behavior and bandwidth requirement. The evaluation results show that homogeneous mini-rank significantly reduces memory power with small performance loss. For instance, using four-core multiprogramming workloads, a x32 mini-rank configuration reduces memory power by 19.5 percent with 1.3 percent performance loss on average for memory-intensive workloads. Heterogeneous mini-rank further improves the balance between the performance and power saving. For instance, it reduces the memory power by up to 38.0 percent with an average performance loss of 2.4 percent, compared with a conventional memory system. In comparison, the x32 homogeneous mini-rank reduces memory power by up to 25.4 percent; while the x8 homogeneous mini-rank incurs performance loss by up to 19.3 percent. Furthermore, heterogeneous mini-rank achieves consistently good performance-power tradeoff for workloads made by programs of diverse memory access behavior and bandwidth requirement.","doi":"10.1109/TC.2012.240","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6828816","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.2012.240","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/12/6828816/06319293.pdf","startPage":"1500","endPage":"1512","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Mini-Rank: A Power-EfficientDDRx DRAM Memory Architecture","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 October 2012","displayDocTitle":"Mini-Rank: A Power-EfficientDDRx DRAM Memory Architecture","volume":"63","issue":"6","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2014","dateOfInsertion":"10 June 2014","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6319293/","publicationDate":"June 2014","accessionNumber":"14379300","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6319293/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mini-Rank: A Power-EfficientDDRx DRAM Memory Architecture","sourcePdf":"tc-zhu-240-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.100379S","chronDate":"June  2014","xplore-pub-id":"12","isNumber":"6828816","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6828816","articleId":"6319293","onlineDate":"02 October 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6319300,"authors":[{"name":"Chuitian Rong","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Data Engineering and Knowledge Engineering, Ministry of Education,  China,  and the School of Information, Renmin University of China, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/69/6583920/6319300/6319300-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Chuitian Rong received the PhD degree in Computer Science from Renmin University of China in 2013.

Recently, there has been considerable interest in designing new algorithms with the assistant of an inverted index to support efficient string similarity joins. These algorithms typically adopt a two-step filter-and-refine approach in identifying similar string pairs: 1) generating candidate pairs by traversing the inverted index; and 2) verifying the candidate pairs by computing the similarity. However, these algorithms either suffer from poor filtering power (which results in high verification cost), or incur too much computational cost to guarantee the filtering power. In this paper, we propose a multiple prefix filtering method based on different global orderings such that the number of candidate pairs can be reduced significantly. We also propose a parallel extension of the algorithm that is efficient and scalable in a MapReduce framework. We conduct extensive experiments on both centralized and Hadoop systems using both real and synthetic data sets, and the results show that our proposed approach outperforms existing approaches in both efficiency and scalability.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6319300/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 October 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"25","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"22 August 2013","accessionNumber":"13732498","htmlLink":"/document/6319300/","displayDocTitle":"Efficient and Scalable Processing of String Similarity Join","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient and Scalable Processing of String Similarity Join","sourcePdf":"ttk2013102217.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.093079S","chronDate":"Oct.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"69","isNumber":"6583920","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"69","citationCount":"33","xplore-issue":"6583920","articleId":"6319300","onlineDate":"02 October 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6319304,"authors":[{"name":"Beatriz Lorenzo","affiliation":["Department of Communications Engineering, Centre for Wireless Communications (CWC), University of Oulu, Oulu, Finland"],"firstName":"Beatriz","lastName":"Lorenzo","id":"37303586500"},{"name":"Savo Glisic","affiliation":["Department of Communications Engineering, Centre for Wireless Communications (CWC), University of Oulu, Oulu, Finland"],"firstName":"Savo","lastName":"Glisic","id":"37269887800"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1536-1233"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0660"},{"format":"CD","value":"2161-9875"}],"articleNumber":"6319304","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":31,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1064},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Topology","Network topology","Interference","Genetic algorithms","Heuristic algorithms","Optimization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","genetic algorithms","interference suppression","scheduling","search problems","telecommunication network routing","telecommunication network topology","telecommunication traffic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimal routing","traffic scheduling","multihop cellular network","nonuniform traffic distribution","multihop wireless network","network topology","NP-hard problem","search problem","small toy model","heuristic algorithm","sequential genetic algorithm","relaying topology optimization","intercell interference","spatial traffic distribution dynamics","chromosomes set","crossover operation","mutation operation","fitness function","throughput","power consumption","delay","SGA","dynamic network environment"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cellular network","dynamic traffic distribution","genetic algorithm","intercell interference","network optimization","relaying","topology control"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TMC.2012.204","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6319304","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMC.2012.204","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6604394","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/7755/6604394/06319304.pdf","startPage":"2274","endPage":"2288","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal Routing and Traffic Scheduling for Multihop Cellular Networks Using Genetic Algorithm","abstract":"When considering a multicell scenario with nonuniform traffic distribution in multihop wireless networks, the search for the optimum topology becomes an NP-hard problem. For such problems, exact algorithms based on exhaustive search are only useful for small toy models, so heuristic algorithms such as genetic algorithms (GA) must be used in practice. For this purpose, we present a novel sequential genetic algorithm (SGA) to optimize the relaying topology in multihop cellular networks aware of the intercell interference and the spatial traffic distribution dynamics. We encode the topologies as a set of chromosomes and special crossover and mutation operations are proposed to search for the optimum topology. The performance is measured by a fitness function that includes the throughput, power consumption and delay. Improvement in the fitness function is sequentially controlled as newer generations evolve and whenever the improvement is sufficiently increased the current topology is updated by the new one having higher fitness. Numerical results show that SGA provides both high performance improvements in the system and fast convergence (at least one order of magnitude faster than exhaustive search) in a dynamic network environment. We also demonstrate the robustness of our algorithm to the initial state of the network.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6319304/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 October 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2013","volume":"12","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"19 September 2013","publicationDate":"Nov. 2013","accessionNumber":"13795117","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Optimal Routing and Traffic Scheduling for Multihop Cellular Networks Using Genetic Algorithm","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal Routing and Traffic Scheduling for Multihop Cellular Networks Using Genetic Algorithm","sourcePdf":"ttm2013112274.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.085911S","chronDate":"Nov.  2013","isNumber":"6604394","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7755","citationCount":"31","articleId":"6319304","onlineDate":"02 October 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6319305,"authors":[{"name":"Yanmin Zhu","affiliation":["Shanghai Key Laboratory of Scalable Computing and Systems, Shanghai, China, and the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7755/6604394/6319305/6319305-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yanmin Zhu received the PhD degree from the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology in 2007.

We propose an approach for metropolitan-scale traffic estimation with probe vehicles that periodically send location and speed updates to a monitoring center. In our approach, we use the flow speed on a road link within a time slot to indicate the traffic condition of the road segment at the given time slot, which is approximated by the average value of probe speeds. By analyzing a large data set of two-year probe data collected from a fleet of around 4,000 taxis in Shanghai, China, we find that a set of probe data may contain a lot of spatiotemporal vacancies over both time and space. This raises a serious missing data problem for road traffic estimation, which results from the naturally uneven distribution of probe vehicles over both time and space. Through empirical study based on the data set of real probe data using principal component analysis (PCA), we have observed that there are hidden structures within the traffic conditions of a road network. Inspired by this observation, we propose a compressive sensing-based algorithm for solving the missing data problem, which exploits the hidden structures for computing estimates for road traffic conditions. Different from existing approaches, our algorithm does not rely on complicated traffic models, which usually require costly training with field study and large data sets. With extensive experiments based on the data set of real probe data, we demonstrate that our proposed algorithm performs significantly better than other completing algorithms, including KNN and MSSA. Surprisingly, our algorithm can achieve an estimate error of as low as 20 percent even when more than 80 percent of probe data are missing.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/7755/6604394/06319305.pdf","startPage":"2289","endPage":"2302","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","doi":"10.1109/TMC.2012.205","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMC.2012.205","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6604394","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6319305","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Compressive Sensing Approach to Urban Traffic Estimation with Probe Vehicles","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Probes","Roads","Vehicles","Estimation","Monitoring","Compressed sensing","Principal component analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compressed sensing","data analysis","estimation theory","principal component analysis","road traffic","road vehicles","spatiotemporal phenomena"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compressive sensing approach","urban road traffic estimation","probe vehicle","metropolitan scale traffic estimation","traffic monitoring center","road link","road segment","time slot","spatiotemporal vacancy","missing data problem","data set","principal component analysis","PCA","road network","hidden structure","traffic model","KNN","MSSA","error estimation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Probe vehicles","traffic estimation","traffic condition matrix","compressive sensing"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6319305/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 October 2012","displayDocTitle":"A Compressive Sensing Approach to Urban Traffic Estimation with Probe Vehicles","volume":"12","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/6319305/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2013","accessionNumber":"13795114","dateOfInsertion":"19 September 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Compressive Sensing Approach to Urban Traffic Estimation with Probe Vehicles","sourcePdf":"ttm2013112289.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.113789S","chronDate":"Nov.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"7755","isNumber":"6604394","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7755","citationCount":"115","xplore-issue":"6604394","articleId":"6319305","onlineDate":"02 October 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6319316,"authors":[{"name":"Kaiming He","affiliation":["Visual Computing Group, Microsoft Research Asia, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/34/6504892/6319316/6319316-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Kaiming He received the BS degree from the Academic Talent Program, Physics Department, Tsinghua University in 2007, and the PhD degree from the Department of Information Engineering, the Chinese University of Hong Kong in 2011.

Derived from a local linear model, the guided filter computes the filtering output by considering the content of a guidance image, which can be the input image itself or another different image. The guided filter can be used as an edge-preserving smoothing operator like the popular bilateral filter [1], but it has better behaviors near edges. The guided filter is also a more generic concept beyond smoothing: It can transfer the structures of the guidance image to the filtering output, enabling new filtering applications like dehazing and guided feathering. Moreover, the guided filter naturally has a fast and nonapproximate linear time algorithm, regardless of the kernel size and the intensity range. Currently, it is one of the fastest edge-preserving filters. Experiments show that the guided filter is both effective and efficient in a great variety of computer vision and computer graphics applications, including edge-aware smoothing, detail enhancement, HDR compression, image matting/feathering, dehazing, joint upsampling, etc.","doi":"10.1109/TPAMI.2012.213","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6504892","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.2012.213","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel5/34/6504892/06319316.pdf","startPage":"1397","endPage":"1409","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Guided Image Filtering","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 October 2012","displayDocTitle":"Guided Image Filtering","volume":"35","issue":"6","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2013","dateOfInsertion":"18 April 2013","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6319316/","publicationDate":"June 2013","pubMedId":"23599054","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6319316/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Guided Image Filtering","sourcePdf":"ttp2013061397.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.127389S","chronDate":"June  2013","xplore-pub-id":"34","isNumber":"6504892","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"2548","xplore-issue":"6504892","articleId":"6319316","onlineDate":"02 October 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":6319317,"authors":[{"name":"Ruiqi Guo","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign, Urbana, IL"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/34/6648559/6319317/6319317-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ruiqi Guo received the BE degree in computer science from Zhejiang University, China, in 2009.

In addition to considering individual regions separately, we predict relative illumination conditions between segmented regions from their appearances and perform pairwise classification based on such information. Classification results are used to build a graph of segments, and graph-cut is used to solve the labeling of shadow and nonshadow regions. Detection results are later refined by image matting, and the shadow-free image is recovered by relighting each pixel based on our lighting model. We evaluate our method on the shadow detection dataset in Zhu et al. . In addition, we created a new dataset with shadow-free ground truth images, which provides a quantitative basis for evaluating shadow removal. We study the effectiveness of features for both unary and pairwise classification.","doi":"10.1109/TPAMI.2012.214","startPage":"2956","endPage":"2967","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel5/34/6648559/06319317.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.2012.214","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6648559","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Paired Regions for Shadow Detection and Removal","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Lighting","Shadow detection","Image color analysis","Image edge detection","Histograms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["graph theory","image classification","image enhancement","natural scenes","object detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["unary classification","shadow-free ground truth image","lighting model","shadow-free image","image matting","graph-cut","pairwise classification","relative illumination","region-based approach","edge information","pixel information","natural scene","shadow removal","shadow detection"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Shadow detection","region classification","shadow removal","enhancement"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6319317/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 October 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2013","displayDocTitle":"Paired Regions for Shadow Detection and Removal","volume":"35","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/6319317/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"28 October 2013","accessionNumber":"13875525","pubMedId":"24136433","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Paired Regions for Shadow Detection and Removal","sourcePdf":"ttp2013122956.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.105871S","chronDate":"Dec.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"34","isNumber":"6648559","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"110","xplore-issue":"6648559","articleId":"6319317","onlineDate":"02 October 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":6319318,"authors":[{"name":"Baiyang Liu","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/34/6648559/6319318/6319318-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Baiyang Liu received the BE degree in computer science and technology from Shantou University, China, in 2006, and has been working toward the PhD degree from the Department of Computer Science at Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey, since 2006.

However, it introduces potential drifting problems due to the accumulation of errors during the self-updating, especially for occluded scenarios. The recent literature demonstrates that appropriate combinations of trackers can help balance the stability and flexibility requirements. We have developed a robust tracking algorithm using a local sparse appearance model (SPT) and K-Selection. A static sparse dictionary and a dynamically updated online dictionary basis distribution are used to model the target appearance. A novel sparse representation-based voting map and a sparse constraint regularized mean shift are proposed to track the object robustly. Besides these contributions, we also introduce a new selection-based dictionary learning algorithm with a locally constrained sparse representation, called K-Selection. Based on a set of comprehensive experiments, our algorithm has demonstrated better performance than alternatives reported in the recent literature.","doi":"10.1109/TPAMI.2012.215","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel5/34/6648559/06319318.pdf","startPage":"2968","endPage":"2981","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.2012.215","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6648559","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6319318","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust Visual Tracking Using Local Sparse Appearance Model and K-Selection","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Robust Visual Tracking Using Local Sparse Appearance Model and K-Selection","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6319318/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 October 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2013","volume":"35","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6319318/","dateOfInsertion":"28 October 2013","publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","accessionNumber":"13875542","pubMedId":"24136434","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust Visual Tracking Using Local Sparse Appearance Model and K-Selection","sourcePdf":"ttp2013122968.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.110505S","chronDate":"Dec.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"34","isNumber":"6648559","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"120","xplore-issue":"6648559","articleId":"6319318","onlineDate":"02 October 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-25"},{"_id":6319328,"authors":[{"name":"Zhiyang Liu","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/6381595/6319328/6319328-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Zhiyang Liu received the B.S. in Communication Engineering from Tianjin University, Tianjin, China, in 2010.

Most of them, nevertheless, focused on the sum rate of all the users where the effect of large-scale fading is either ignored or simplified. For interference-limited MIMO cellular networks, users in various locations may achieve drastically different rates due to distinct large-scale fading and interference levels. It is, therefore, of great practical interest to characterize the rate performance of each single user under various power allocation strategies and precoding schemes. This paper presents an asymptotic per-user rate analysis for a 1-tier (i.e., 7-cell) downlink MIMO cellular network with M base-station antennas co-located at the center of each cell and K uniformly distributed users each equipped with N antennas. Explicit expressions of the ergodic rate with two representative linear precoding schemes, singular-value-decomposition (SVD) transmission and block diagonalization (BD), are derived, based on which the effect of power allocation strategies is further evaluated. The analysis shows that the rate performance of each user is sensitive to its position even if the average received power is kept a constant. To achieve a uniform rate all over the cell, an interference-aware power allocation scheme is proposed, with which the transmit power allocated to each user is carefully adjusted according to the large-scale fading coefficients from the user to its own and neighboring base stations. The tradeoff between fairness and sum rate performance is also identified, which highlights the importance of the characterization of per-user rate.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Asymptotic Per-User Rate Analysis of Downlink MIMO Cellular Networks with Linear Precoding","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2012.092512.120589","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/6381595/06319328.pdf","startPage":"4536","endPage":"4548","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2012.092512.120589","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6381595","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6319328","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6319328/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 October 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"December  2012","displayDocTitle":"Asymptotic Per-User Rate Analysis of Downlink MIMO Cellular Networks with Linear Precoding","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"11","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/6319328/","dateOfInsertion":"20 December 2012","publicationDate":"December 2012","accessionNumber":"13188217","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Asymptotic Per-User Rate Analysis of Downlink MIMO Cellular Networks with Linear Precoding","sourcePdf":"4536-tw1212-liu.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.125163S","chronDate":"December  2012","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6381595","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6381595","articleId":"6319328","onlineDate":"02 October 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6319329,"authors":[{"name":"Youngwook Ko","affiliation":["Centre for Communication Systems Research, Department of Electronic Engineering, University of Surrey, Guildford, Surrey, UK"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/6381595/6319329/6319329-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Youngwook Ko (M'07) received the B.S.E. degree with honor in Information and Communications Engineering from Hannam University, Daejeon, South Korea, in 1999, and M.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees in Electrical Engineering from Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ, USA, in 2002 and 2006, respectively.

We design a joint energy and radio spectrum scheme which aims not only for co-existence with the macrocell, but also for an energy-efficient implementation of the multi-femtocells. Particularly, aggregate energy usage on dense femtocell channels is formulated taking into account the cost of both the spectrum and energy usage. We investigate an energy-and-spectral efficient approach to balance between the two costs by varying the number of active sub-channels and their energy. The proposed scheme is addressed by deriving closed-form expressions for the interference towards the macrocell and the outage capacity. Analytically, discrete regions under which the most promising outage capacity is achieved by the same size of active sub-channels are introduced. Through a joint optimization of the sub-channels and their energy, properties can be found for the maximum outage capacity under realistic constraints. Using asymptotic and numerical analysis, it can be noticed that in a dense femtocell deployment, the optimum utilization of the energy and the spectrum to maximize the outage capacity converges towards a round-robin scheduling approach for a very small outage threshold. This is the inverse of the traditional greedy approach.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2012.092512.112145","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/6381595/06319329.pdf","startPage":"4416","endPage":"4425","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2012.092512.112145","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6381595","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Maximum Outage Capacity in Dense Indoor Femtocell Networks with Joint Energy and Spectrum Utilization","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6319329","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 October 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"December  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6319329/","displayDocTitle":"Maximum Outage Capacity in Dense Indoor Femtocell Networks with Joint Energy and Spectrum Utilization","volume":"11","issue":"12","publicationDate":"December 2012","accessionNumber":"13188218","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6319329/","dateOfInsertion":"20 December 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Maximum Outage Capacity in Dense Indoor Femtocell Networks with Joint Energy and Spectrum Utilization","sourcePdf":"4416-tw1212-ko.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.161394S","chronDate":"December  2012","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6381595","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"6381595","articleId":"6319329","onlineDate":"02 October 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6319332,"authors":[{"name":"Praveen Kaligineedi","affiliation":["JDS Uniphase Corporation, Vancouver, Canada","University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada"],"firstName":"Praveen","lastName":"Kaligineedi","id":"37296956300"},{"name":"Gaurav Bansal","affiliation":["University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada"],"firstName":"Gaurav","lastName":"Bansal","id":"37391718200"},{"name":"Vijay K.

The interference is introduced into PU band by CR user not only because of co-existence in side-by-side bands but also by missed detection due to imperfect sensing. We propose an optimal scheme such that the transmission capacity of CR users is maximized while keeping the total interference within a prescribed threshold and keeping the total power within a budget. As the optimal scheme can have a high complexity, low complexity suboptimal schemes have also been proposed. The performance of the proposed schemes is compared to the schemes that do not take sensing errors into consideration.

Therefore, the CDD provides a low-complexity means of increasing the transmission diversity in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) OFDM systems. However, the optimal pilot sequences which minimize the mean square error (MSE) of the channel estimate in traditional MIMO-OFDM systems are inapplicable to CDD-OFDM systems. Accordingly, this paper commences by deriving the criteria which yield the minimum MSE of both the least square (LS) channel estimate and the minimum mean square error (MMSE) channel estimate in CDD-OFDM systems. The derived criteria are then used to develop a general methodology for determining the optimal pilot sequence. Significantly, the proposed design methodology enables the status of the channel to be estimated using just one OFDM symbol. The simulation results confirm that the proposed pilot design minimizes the MSE of both the LS and the MMSE channel estimates.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal Pilot Sequence Design for Channel Estimation in CDD-OFDM Systems","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2012.092412.112033","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/6361508/06319334.pdf","startPage":"4006","endPage":"4016","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2012.092412.112033","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6361508","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6319334","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6319334/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 October 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"November  2012","displayDocTitle":"Optimal Pilot Sequence Design for Channel Estimation in CDD-OFDM Systems","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"11","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/6319334/","dateOfInsertion":"26 November 2012","publicationDate":"November 2012","accessionNumber":"13148981","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal Pilot Sequence Design for Channel Estimation in CDD-OFDM Systems","sourcePdf":"4006-tw1211-huang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.094388S","chronDate":"November  2012","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6361508","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"6361508","articleId":"6319334","onlineDate":"02 October 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6319335,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaolei Hao","affiliation":["TELUS Mobility, Vancouver, Canada","Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/6361508/6319335/6319335-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Xiaolei Hao (S'11) was born in Lanzhou, Gansu, China, in 1987.

In this paper, we consider a CRN with multiple primary users (PUs) and multiple secondary users (SUs). We first propose a cooperative spectrum sensing and access (CSSA) scheme for all the SUs, where the SUs cooperatively sense the licensed channels of the PUs in the sensing subframe. If a channel is determined to be idle, the SUs which have sensed that channel will have a chance to transmit packets in the data transmission subframe. We then formulate this multi-channel spectrum sensing and channel access problem as a hedonic coalition formation game, where a coalition corresponds to the SUs that have chosen to sense and access a particular channel. The value function of each coalition and the utility function of each SU take into account both the sensing accuracy and the energy consumption. We propose an algorithm for decision node selection in a coalition. Moreover, we propose an algorithm based on the switch rule to allow the SUs to make decisions on whether to join or leave a coalition. We prove analytically that the set with all the SUs converges to a final network partition, which is both Nash-stable and individually stable. Besides, the proposed algorithms are adaptive to changes in network conditions. Simulation results show that our proposed CSSA scheme achieves a better performance than the closest PU (CPU) scheme and the noncooperative spectrum sensing and access (NSSA) scheme in terms of the average utility of the SUs.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2012.092412.111833","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/6361508/06319335.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6361508","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2012.092412.111833","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","startPage":"3968","endPage":"3979","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hedonic Coalition Formation Game for Cooperative Spectrum Sensing and Channel Access in Cognitive Radio Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6319335","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"November  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 October 2012","displayDocTitle":"Hedonic Coalition Formation Game for Cooperative Spectrum Sensing and Channel Access in Cognitive Radio Networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6319335/","volume":"11","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/6319335/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"November 2012","accessionNumber":"13148982","dateOfInsertion":"26 November 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hedonic Coalition Formation Game for Cooperative Spectrum Sensing and Channel Access in Cognitive Radio Networks","sourcePdf":"3968-tw1211-hao.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.086308S","chronDate":"November  2012","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6361508","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"38","xplore-issue":"6361508","articleId":"6319335","onlineDate":"02 October 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6319336,"authors":[{"name":"Hai Lin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Information Systems, Graduate School of Engineering, Osaka Prefecture University, Sakai, Osaka, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/6381595/6319336/6319336-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Hai Lin (S'00-M'05) received the B.E. degree from Shanghai JiaoTong University, China, in 1993, the M.E. degree from University of the Ryukyus, Japan, in 2000, and the Dr. Eng. degree from Osaka Prefecture University, Japan, in 2005.

Then, the magnitude response can be used to determine the corresponding minimum phase response. Subsequently, from the cross-correlation of the branch signals, we can estimate the frequency-independent phase imbalance. Since the proposed method has an analytical solution, it can be easily implemented. Simulations of various scenarios confirm its validity and its superior compensation performance.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2012.092412.111680","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/6381595/06319336.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2012.092412.111680","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6381595","startPage":"4342","endPage":"4350","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Time Domain Blind I/Q Imbalance Compensation Based on Real-Valued Filter","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6319336","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Time Domain Blind I/Q Imbalance Compensation Based on Real-Valued Filter","chronOrPublicationDate":"December  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6319336/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 October 2012","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"11","issue":"12","publicationDate":"December 2012","accessionNumber":"13188222","dateOfInsertion":"20 December 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6319336/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Time Domain Blind I/Q Imbalance Compensation Based on Real-Valued Filter","sourcePdf":"4342-tw1212-lin.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.085556S","chronDate":"December  2012","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6381595","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"6381595","articleId":"6319336","onlineDate":"02 October 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6319338,"authors":[{"name":"Omar El Ayach","affiliation":["Wireless Networking and Communications Group, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Texas, Austin, Austin, TX, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/6361508/6319338/6319338-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Omar El Ayach (S'08) received his B.E. degree in computer and communications engineering from the American University of Beirut, Lebanon, in 2008.

Realizing IA gains, however, is contingent upon providing transmitters with sufficiently accurate channel knowledge. In this paper, we study the performance of IA in multiple-input multiple-output systems where channel knowledge is acquired through training and analog feedback. We design the training and feedback system to maximize IA's effective sum-rate: a non-asymptotic performance metric that accounts for estimation error, training and feedback overhead, and channel selectivity. We characterize effective sum-rate with overhead in relation to various parameters such as signal-to-noise ratio, Doppler spread, and feedback channel quality. A main insight from our analysis is that, by properly designing the CSI acquisition process, IA can provide good sum-rate performance in a very wide range of fading scenarios. Another observation from our work is that such overhead-aware analysis can help solve a number of practical network design problems. To demonstrate the concept of overhead-aware network design, we consider the example problem of finding the optimal number of cooperative IA users based on signal power and mobility.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2012.092412120588","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/6361508/06319338.pdf","startPage":"4192","endPage":"4203","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2012.092412120588","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6361508","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Overhead of Interference Alignment: Training, Feedback, and Cooperation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6319338","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 October 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"November  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6319338/","displayDocTitle":"On the Overhead of Interference Alignment: Training, Feedback, and Cooperation","volume":"11","issue":"11","publicationDate":"November 2012","accessionNumber":"13148984","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6319338/","dateOfInsertion":"26 November 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Overhead of Interference Alignment: Training, Feedback, and Cooperation","sourcePdf":"4192-tw1211-ayach.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.112089S","chronDate":"November  2012","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6361508","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"79","xplore-issue":"6361508","articleId":"6319338","onlineDate":"02 October 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6319339,"authors":[{"name":"Hossam M.

Two performance measures of this system, namely the BER and maximum achievable number of users, are compared to that of traditional systems adopting complementary and non-complementary keying. Our results reveal that the proposed technique allows each user to transmit at high data rates, compared to traditional techniques, while keeping the BER well below a prescribed threshold.

AANNs are used to model speakers in speaker verification, where a speaker-specific AANN model is obtained by adapting (or retraining) the Universal Background Model (UBM) AANN, an AANN trained on multiple held out speakers, using corresponding speaker data. When the amount of speaker data is limited, this adaptation procedure leads to overfitting. Additionally, the resultant speaker-specific parameters become noisy due to outliers in data. Thus, we propose to regularize the parameters of an AANN during speaker adaptation. A closed-form expression for updating the parameters is derived. Further, these speaker-specific AANN parameters are directly used as features in linear discriminant analysis (LDA)/probabilistic discriminant (PLDA) analysis based speaker verification system. The proposed speaker verification system outperforms the previously proposed weighted least squares (WLS) based AANN speaker verification system on NIST-08 speaker recognition evaluation (SRE). Moreover, the proposed speaker verification system obviates the need for an intermediate dimensionality reduction (or i-vector extraction) step.","doi":"10.1109/LSP.2012.2221706","startPage":"841","endPage":"844","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/97/6323087/06319350.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LSP.2012.2221706","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6323087","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Regularized Auto-Associative Neural Networks for Speaker Verification","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Adaptation models","Training","Feature extraction","Vectors","Neural networks","Mel frequency cepstral coefficient","Data models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feedforward neural nets","probability","speaker recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["regularized auto-associative neural network","feed-forward neural network","universal background model","AANN","speaker-specific parameter","speaker adaptation","closed-form expression","linear discriminant analysis","probabilistic discriminant analysis","speaker verification system","NIST-08 speaker recognition evaluation","intermediate dimensionality reduction"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Adaptation","auto-associative neural network","regularization","speaker verification"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6319350/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 October 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2012","displayDocTitle":"Regularized Auto-Associative Neural Networks for Speaker Verification","volume":"19","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/6319350/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"15 October 2012","accessionNumber":"13054004","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Regularized Auto-Associative Neural Networks for Speaker Verification","sourcePdf":"lsp-garimella-2221706-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.04329S","chronDate":"Dec.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"97","isNumber":"6323087","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"97","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"6323087","articleId":"6319350","onlineDate":"02 October 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6319351,"authors":[{"name":"Shinya Sugiura","affiliation":["Toyota Central R&D Laboratories, Inc., Nagakute, Aichi, Japan"],"firstName":"Shinya","lastName":"Sugiura","id":"37667603100"},{"name":"Lajos Hanzo","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Computer Science, University of Southampton, Southampton, U.K."],"firstName":"Lajos","lastName":"Hanzo","id":"37276255400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1070-9908"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2361"}],"articleNumber":"6319351","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":64,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1186},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","Joints","MIMO","Bit error rate","Transmitters","Radio frequency","Signal to noise ratio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antennas","channel estimation","communication complexity","error statistics","MIMO communication","modulation","radio transmitters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["training-based channel estimation","spatial modulation","multiple-input multiple-output scheme","MIMO scheme","SM transmitter","radio-frequency branch","RF branch","antenna element","AE","BER curve","single-RF arrangement","reduced-complexity joint channel estimation","data detection","noncoherently detected single-RF space-time shift keying scheme"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Channel estimation","iterative detection","non-coherent detection","single-RF MIMO","space-shift keying","space-time shift keying","spatial modulation","training signals"]}],"abstract":"In this letter, we investigate the effects of training-based channel estimation on the achievable performance of the recent spatial modulation (SM) based multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) scheme. This is motivated by the fact that the SM transmitter is constituted by a single radio-frequency (RF) branch and multiple antenna elements (AEs), hence simultaneous pilot transmissions from the AEs are impossible, unlike in the classic multiple-RF MIMO transmitters. Our simulation results demonstrate that the SM scheme's BER curve exhibits a performance penalty, while relying on realistic imperfect channel-estimation. In order to combat these limitations, we propose two single-RF arrangements, namely a reduced-complexity joint channel estimation and data detection aided SM scheme as well as a non-coherently detected single-RF space-time shift keying scheme dispensing with channel estimation.","doi":"10.1109/LSP.2012.2221707","publicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/97/6323087/06319351.pdf","startPage":"805","endPage":"808","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6323087","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LSP.2012.2221707","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Effects of Channel Estimation on Spatial Modulation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6319351","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2012","displayDocTitle":"Effects of Channel Estimation on Spatial Modulation","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6319351/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"09 October 2012","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"13034524","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6319351/","volume":"19","issue":"12","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 October 2012","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Effects of Channel Estimation on Spatial Modulation","sourcePdf":"lsp-hanzo-2221707-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.062816S","chronDate":"Dec.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"97","isNumber":"6323087","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"97","citationCount":"64","xplore-issue":"6323087","articleId":"6319351","onlineDate":"02 October 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6319352,"authors":[{"name":"Yingbo Hua","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of California, Riverside, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Yingbo","lastName":"Hua","id":"37276939700"},{"name":"Ping Liang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of California, Riverside, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Ping","lastName":"Liang","id":"37084698900"},{"name":"Yiming Ma","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of California, Riverside, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Yiming","lastName":"Ma","id":"37085518185"},{"name":"Ali Cagatay Cirik","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of California, Riverside, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Ali Cagatay","lastName":"Cirik","id":"37085390989"},{"name":"Qian Gao","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of California, Riverside, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Qian","lastName":"Gao","id":"37085339191"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1070-9908"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2361"}],"articleNumber":"6319352","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":104,"citationCountPatent":21,"totalDownloads":2287},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radio frequency","Receiving antennas","Generators","Transmitting antennas","Array signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","broadband networks","frequency-domain analysis","interference suppression","MIMO communication","OFDM modulation","radio receivers","radiofrequency interference","time-domain analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["broadband full-duplex MIMO radio","time-domain transmit beamforming method","TDTB method","self-interference cancelation","SIC","radiofrequency frontend","RF frontend","radio receiver","frequency-domain transmit beamforming method","FDTB method","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","OFDM","gain 50 dB","bandwidth 30 MHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Full-duplex radar","full-duplex wireless communication","single channel full-duplex"]}],"abstract":"We present a time-domain transmit beamforming (TDTB) method for self-interference cancelation (SIC) at the radio frequency (RF) frontend of the receivers on broadband full-duplex MIMO radios.

The most challenging barrier against these advances relates to communication delays, which are not constant and depend on information system loading. Neglecting this latency could deteriorate the damping performance of closed loop control or even degrade the system stability. This paper designs a fuzzy logic wide-area damping controller (FLWADC) to damp the inter-area oscillations compensating for the continuous latency. The controller is based on the fuzzy logic due to its proven robustness against input signal variations. The proposed controller has three input signals consisting of angular difference, its derivative, and the time latency, which is precisely determined through measured data time tags and the accurate time signal at the controller location. Rule bases of FLWADC are developed such that membership functions of the output variable are accordingly shifted to compensate for the time delay. A standard test bed for dynamic simulations and its expanded version are examined, and numerical evidences are discussed. To generalize the conclusions drawn in the case study, various sets of sensitivity studies are conducted, covering controller parameter changes, power system reconfigurations, and shifting the system operating point.","doi":"10.1109/TPWRS.2012.2215347","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRS.2012.2215347","startPage":"1997","endPage":"2005","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/59/6504806/06319373.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6504806","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Wide-area power oscillation damping with a fuzzy controller compensating the continuous communication delays","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 October 2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2013","displayDocTitle":"Wide-area power oscillation damping with a fuzzy controller compensating the continuous communication delays","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2013","dateOfInsertion":"18 April 2013","volume":"28","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6319373/","accessionNumber":"13934083","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6319373/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wide-area power oscillation damping with a fuzzy controller compensating the continuous communication delays","sourcePdf":"tpwrs-aminifar-2215347-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.089878S","chronDate":"May  2013","xplore-pub-id":"59","isNumber":"6504806","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"103","xplore-issue":"6504806","articleId":"6319373","onlineDate":"02 October 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-05"},{"_id":6319376,"authors":[{"name":"Jiebei Zhu","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University of Strathclyde, Glasgow, U.K."],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/59/6504806/6319376/6319376-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jiebei Zhu received the B.S. degree in microelectronics from Nankai University, Tianjin, China, and the M.Sc. degree in electronic and electrical engineering from the University of Strathclyde, Glasgow, U.K., in 2008 and 2009, respectively.

The estimation technique makes use of voltage and current sensors which are already in place for protection and control purposes. The novel aspect of the proposed technique relates to monitoring capacitors in real time while the motor is operational. No external interferences, such as injected signals or special operation of the drive, are required. The condition monitoring system is independent of torque and speed and hence independent of a variation in the load. The condition monitoring system is validated using manual calculations, simulation, low-voltage experimentation, and high-voltage implementation on an aerospace drive.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Capacitors","Monitoring","Sensors","Condition monitoring","Fault tolerant systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["aerospace engineering","capacitors","condition monitoring","drives","electric sensing devices"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dc-link capacitors","aerospace drives","online condition monitoring system","dc-link metallized polypropylene capacitors","fault-tolerant drives","aerospace applications","estimation technique","current sensors","voltage sensors","control purposes","protection purposes","injected signals","condition monitoring system","manual calculations","high-voltage implementation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Condition monitoring","fault detection","fault-tolerant systems","metallized polypropylene film (MPPF) capacitors"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6399585","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIA.2012.2222333","startPage":"1866","endPage":"1874","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/28/6399585/06319385.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TIA.2012.2222333","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Condition Monitoring of DC-Link Capacitors in Aerospace Drives","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 October 2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Condition Monitoring of DC-Link Capacitors in Aerospace Drives","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"13191348","publicationDate":"Nov.-Dec. 2012","volume":"48","issue":"6","dateOfInsertion":"04 January 2013","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6319385/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6319385/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.-Dec.  2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Condition Monitoring of DC-Link Capacitors in Aerospace Drives","sourcePdf":"tia-wechsler-2222333-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.07346S","chronDate":"Nov.-Dec.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"28","isNumber":"6399585","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"28","citationCount":"45","xplore-issue":"6399585","articleId":"6319385","onlineDate":"02 October 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6319390,"authors":[{"name":"Jaume Joven","affiliation":["Integrated Systems Laboratory (LSI), \u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/9424/6582568/6319390/6319390-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jaume Joven received the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in computer science from the Universitat Auton\u00f2ma de Barcelona (UAB), Bellaterra, Spain, in 2004 and 2009, respectively.","He is currently a postdoctoral Researcher in \u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland.

This paper presents a simple, new active damping technique that can stabilize effectively the drive system at unstable operating points, offering greatly reduced input line current total harmonic distortion. The proposed method requires only a first-order, high-pass filter with a gain. Active damping voltage terms, linked directly to the dc-link voltage ripple through gain units, are injected to the drive machine for stabilizing the operating points. The stabilizing effect of the active damping terms is demonstrated for an induction machine based drive system. The effects of the added damping terms on the machine current and dc-link voltage are analyzed in detail. A design recommendation for the proposed active damping terms is given.

However, it still lacks a physically plausible explanation about why SSC is a better model than conventional sparse coding for the class of natural images. Meanwhile, the problem of sparsity optimization, especially when tangled with dictionary learning, is computationally difficult to solve. In this paper, we take a low-rank approach toward SSC and provide a conceptually simple interpretation from a bilateral variance estimation perspective, namely that singular-value decomposition of similar packed patches can be viewed as pooling both local and nonlocal information for estimating signal variances. Such perspective inspires us to develop a new class of image restoration algorithms called spatially adaptive iterative singular-value thresholding (SAIST). For noise data, SAIST generalizes the celebrated BayesShrink from local to nonlocal models; for incomplete data, SAIST extends previous deterministic annealing-based solution to sparsity optimization through incorporating the idea of dictionary learning. In addition to conceptual simplicity and computational efficiency, SAIST has achieved highly competent (often better) objective performance compared to several state-of-the-art methods in image denoising and completion experiments. Our subjective quality results compare favorably with those obtained by existing techniques, especially at high noise levels and with a large amount of missing data.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Nonlocal Image Restoration With Bilateral Variance Estimation: A Low-Rank Approach","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2012.2221729","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/83/6407512/06319405.pdf","startPage":"700","endPage":"711","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2012.2221729","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6407512","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6319405","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6319405/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 October 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2013","displayDocTitle":"Nonlocal Image Restoration With Bilateral Variance Estimation: A Low-Rank Approach","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"22","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/6319405/","dateOfInsertion":"11 January 2013","publicationDate":"Feb. 2013","accessionNumber":"13219177","pubMedId":"23047875","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Nonlocal Image Restoration With Bilateral Variance Estimation: A Low-Rank Approach","sourcePdf":"tip-li-2221729-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.125051S","chronDate":"Feb.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"6407512","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"411","xplore-issue":"6407512","articleId":"6319405","onlineDate":"02 October 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-17"},{"_id":6319406,"authors":[{"name":"Hojatollah Yeganeh","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, ON, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/83/6407512/6319406/6319406-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Hojatollah Yeganeh (S'10) received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from the Isfahan University of Technology, Isfahan, Iran, and the M.Sc. degree in electronics engineering, specializing in speech processing and speech recognition, from the Amirkabir University of Technology, Tehran, Iran, in 2006 and 2009, respectively.

Different TMOs create different tone-mapped images, and a natural question is which one has the best quality. Without an appropriate quality measure, different TMOs cannot be compared, and further improvement is directionless. Subjective rating may be a reliable evaluation method, but it is expensive and time consuming, and more importantly, is difficult to be embedded into optimization frameworks. Here we propose an objective quality assessment algorithm for tone-mapped images by combining: 1) a multiscale signal fidelity measure on the basis of a modified structural similarity index and 2) a naturalness measure on the basis of intensity statistics of natural images. Validations using independent subject-rated image databases show good correlations between subjective ranking score and the proposed tone-mapped image quality index (TMQI). Furthermore, we demonstrate the extended applications of TMQI using two examples - parameter tuning for TMOs and adaptive fusion of multiple tone-mapped images.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6319406/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 October 2012","volume":"22","issue":"2","accessionNumber":"13219174","pubMedId":"23047872","publicationDate":"Feb. 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6319406/","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2013","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Objective Quality Assessment of Tone-Mapped Images","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Objective Quality Assessment of Tone-Mapped Images","sourcePdf":"tip-yeganeh-2221725-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.097009S","chronDate":"Feb.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"6407512","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"341","xplore-issue":"6407512","articleId":"6319406","onlineDate":"02 October 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":6319407,"authors":[{"name":"Vishwambhar Rathi","affiliation":["Nvidia Corporation, Santa Clara, CA, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Vishwambhar Rathi obtained the Bachelor of Technology (B.Tech) degree in Electrical Engineering from Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay (IITB), India.

A code construction method is proposed using two edge-type low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes based on the coset encoding scheme. Using a single edge-type LDPC ensemble with a given threshold over the BEC, we give a construction for a two edge-type LDPC ensemble with the same threshold. If the given single edge-type LDPC ensemble has degree two variable nodes, our construction gives rise to degree one variable nodes in the code used over the main channel. This results in zero threshold over the main channel. In order to circumvent this problem, the degree distribution of the two edge-type LDPC ensemble is numerically optimized. We find that the resulting ensembles are able to perform close to the boundary of the rate-equivocation region of the wiretap channel. Further, a method to compute the ensemble average equivocation of two edge-type LDPC ensembles is provided by generalizing a recently published approach to measure the equivocation of single edge-type ensembles for transmission over the BEC in the point-to-point setting. From this analysis, we find that relatively simple constructions give very good secrecy performance.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2012.2219577","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6413249","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/6413249/06319407.pdf","endPage":"1064","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance Analysis and Design of Two Edge-Type LDPC Codes for the BEC Wiretap Channel","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2012.2219577","startPage":"1048","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6319407","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 October 2012","displayDocTitle":"Performance Analysis and Design of Two Edge-Type LDPC Codes for the BEC Wiretap Channel","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6319407/","dateOfInsertion":"16 January 2013","accessionNumber":"13234719","publicationDate":"Feb. 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6319407/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"59","issue":"2","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance Analysis and Design of Two Edge-Type LDPC Codes for the BEC Wiretap Channel","sourcePdf":"tit-rathi-2219577-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.082767S","chronDate":"Feb.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"6413249","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"6413249","articleId":"6319407","onlineDate":"02 October 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6319408,"authors":[{"name":"Runyao Duan","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering and Information Technology, University of Technology, Sydney, N.S.W., Australia"],"bio":{"p":["Runyao Duan received the B.S. and Ph.D. degrees from the Department of Computer Science and Technology, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, in July 2002 and July 2006, respectively.

Motivated by recent progress on this question, we propose to consider a certain subspace of operators (so-called operator systems) as the quantum generalization of the adjacency matrix, in terms of which the zero-error capacity of a quantum channel, as well as the quantum and entanglement-assisted zero-error capacities can be formulated, and for which we show some new basic properties. Most importantly, we define a quantum version of Lov\u00e1sz' famous \u03d1 function on general operator systems, as the norm-completion (or stabilization) of a \u201cnaive\u201d generalization of \u03d1. We go on to show that this function upper bounds the number of entanglement-assisted zero-error messages, that it is given by a semidefinite program, whose dual we write down explicitly, and that it is multiplicative with respect to the tensor product of operator systems (corresponding to the tensor product of channels). We explore various other properties of the new quantity, which reduces to Lov\u00e1sz' original \u03d1 in the classical case, give several applications, and propose to study the operator systems associated with channels as \u201cnoncommutative graphs,\u201d using the language of Hilbert modules.","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2012.2221677","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information

discomfort for the patient, but at the price of a large amount of time for screening. In order to reduce this time, several works have proposed to automatically remove all the frames showing intestinal content. These methods label frames as {intestinal content - clear} without discriminating between types of content (with different physiological meaning) or the portion of image covered. In addition, since the presence of intestinal content has been identified as an indicator of intestinal motility, its accurate quantification can show a potential clinical relevance. In this paper, we present a method for the robust detection and segmentation of intestinal content in WCE images, together with its further discrimination between turbid liquid and bubbles. Our proposal is based on a twofold system. First, frames presenting intestinal content are detected by a support vector machine classifier using color and textural information. Second, intestinal content frames are segmented into {turbid, bubbles, and clear} regions. We show a detailed validation using a large dataset. Our system outperforms previous methods and, for the first time, discriminates between turbid from bubbles media.","doi":"10.1109/TITB.2012.2221472","pdfPath":"/iel5/4233/6353358/06319409.pdf","startPage":"1341","endPage":"1352","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Technology in Biomedicine","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Technology in Biomedicine","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TITB.2012.2221472","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6353358","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Categorization and Segmentation of Intestinal Content Frames for Wireless Capsule Endoscopy","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6319409/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 October 2012","displayDocTitle":"Categorization and Segmentation of Intestinal Content Frames for Wireless Capsule Endoscopy","volume":"16","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"03 December 2012","accessionNumber":"13168245","pubMedId":"24218705","publicationDate":"Nov. 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6319409/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Categorization and Segmentation of Intestinal Content Frames for Wireless Capsule Endoscopy","sourcePdf":"titb-segui-2221472-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.08965S","chronDate":"Nov.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"4233","isNumber":"6353358","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4233","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"6353358","articleId":"6319409","onlineDate":"02 October 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-02"},{"_id":6319410,"authors":[{"name":"W.

The time-domain solution of electromagnetic field is found by using either two-dimensional (2-D) or three-dimensional (3-D) finite-element methods (FEM). The time-domain FEM is first used to obtain a solution for step function excitations by taking into account all the necessary initial conditions. Then, based on time-domain convolution theorem and the principle of integration by parts, a numerical algorithm to find the solutions of any excitations, without additional FEM computation, is deduced. A typical, interesting and meaningful application is to obtain the frequency-domain solutions when sweeping the operating frequency over a wide range. In this paper, a problem involving the finding of the resonant frequency of a copper loop connected with a pair of parallel plates using 3-D FEM is used as an illustrative example. The numerical experiment shows that the proposed method can reduce the computing time effectively and readily as it is easy to adjust the time step size in time-domain FEM.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/20/6482656/06319410.pdf","startPage":"1284","endPage":"1289","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","doi":"10.1109/TMAG.2012.2222041","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMAG.2012.2222041","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6482656","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6319410","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A General Time-Domain Finite-Element Method for Frequency-Domain Solutions","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Finite element methods","Time domain analysis","Resonant frequency","Equations","Mathematical model","Time frequency analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["copper","electromagnetic field theory","finite element analysis","frequency-domain analysis","integration","time-domain analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["time-domain finite-element method","frequency-domain solutions","electromagnetic field","two-dimensional finite element method","three-dimensional finite element method","step function excitations","time-domain convolution theorem","integration-by-parts principle","numerical algorithm","operating frequency","resonant frequency","copper loop"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Computing time","electromagnetic device","electromagnetic field","finite-element method (FEM)","frequency domain","resonant frequency","time domain"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6319410/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 October 2012","displayDocTitle":"A General Time-Domain Finite-Element Method for Frequency-Domain Solutions","volume":"49","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/6319410/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2013","accessionNumber":"13401212","dateOfInsertion":"20 March 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A General Time-Domain Finite-Element Method for Frequency-Domain Solutions","sourcePdf":"tmag-fu-2222041-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.062428S","chronDate":"April  2013","xplore-pub-id":"20","isNumber":"6482656","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6482656","articleId":"6319410","onlineDate":"02 October 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":6319411,"authors":[{"name":"Nicola Bezzo","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, NM, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/3516/6716101/6319411/6319411-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Nicola Bezzo (S\u201910) received the B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees in electrical engineering (Hons.)

The EMC performance of the IMS inverter is compared with that of a heat sink inverter in a similar circuit layout. Both are under the same influence of parasitic capacitive couplings between the SiC JFET drains and the substrate base plate. It is found that although the application of conventional CM filters effectively suppresses the emitted noise in the low-frequency (LF) range, the influence of this capacitive coupling results in slight or no improvement in the middle-frequency (MF) and high-frequency (HF) ranges. To deal with this problem, a system CM equivalent circuit model with extracted parasitic parameters is proposed. The model is able to evaluate the filter insertion losses over a broad conducted EMI frequency band, which is essential to achieve an optimized filter design balanced between performance and cost.

Notch filters are utilized in each synchronous frame to extract positive or negative sequence component.

Beginning with building the power flow paths of a TPC from a DIC or a DOC, the general principles and detailed procedures for the generation and optimization of TPC topologies are presented. Based on these works, a family of nonisolated TPC topologies is developed. The derived TPCs feature single-stage power conversion between any two of the three ports, and result in high integration and high efficiency. One of the proposed TPCs, named Boost-TPC, is taken as an example for verifying the performance of its circuit topology with related operational methods. Pulsewidth modulation and power management methods, used in this circuit, are analyzed in detail. Experiments have been carried out on a 1-kW prototype of the Boost-TPC, which demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed topology derivation method.","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2012.2221746","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/63/6392980/06319419.pdf","startPage":"3297","endPage":"3307","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2012.2221746","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6392980","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6319419","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Topology Derivation of Nonisolated Three-Port DC\u2013DC Converters From DIC and DOC","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Topology Derivation of Nonisolated Three-Port DC\u2013DC Converters From DIC and DOC","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6319419/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 October 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2013","volume":"28","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6319419/","dateOfInsertion":"24 December 2012","publicationDate":"July 2013","accessionNumber":"13191061","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Topology Derivation of Nonisolated Three-Port DC\u2013DC Converters From DIC and DOC","sourcePdf":"tpel-wu-2221746-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.081915S","chronDate":"July  2013","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"6392980","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"148","xplore-issue":"6392980","articleId":"6319419","onlineDate":"02 October 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-22"},{"_id":6319429,"authors":[{"name":"Ahmed Masmoudi","affiliation":["INRS-EMT, Montreal, Qc, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/6373759/6319429/6319429-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ahmed Masmoudi was born in Ariana, Tunisia, on February 10, 1987.

The new technique implements the concept of importance sampling (IS) to find the global maximum of the compressed likelihood function in a modest computational manner. It thereby avoids traditional complex multidimensional grid search or initialization-dependent iterative methods. Indeed, one of the most interesting features is that it transforms the multi-dimensional search inherent to multipath propagation into a much simpler one-dimensional optimization problem in the delays dimension. Moreover, it guarantees convergence to the global maximum, contrarily to the popular iterative implementation of the maximum likelihood criterion by the well known expectation maximization (EM) algorithm. Comparisons with some other methods such as the EM algorithm, MUSIC and accelerated random search (ARS) demonstrates the superiority of the proposed IS-based multipath delay estimator in terms of estimation performance and complexity.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6319429/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.1,  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 October 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6319429/","dateOfInsertion":"13 December 2012","publicationDate":"Jan.1, 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"61","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A Maximum Likelihood Time Delay Estimator in a Multipath Environment Using Importance Sampling","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Maximum Likelihood Time Delay Estimator in a Multipath Environment Using Importance Sampling","sourcePdf":"tsp-masmoudi-2222402-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.067441S","chronDate":"Jan.1,  2013","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"6373759","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"6373759","articleId":"6319429","onlineDate":"02 October 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6319460,"authors":[{"name":"S\u00e1ndor Sz\u00e9n\u00e1si","affiliation":["Doctoral School of Applied Informatics, \u00d3buda University, Budapest, Hungary"],"firstName":"S\u00e1ndor","lastName":"Sz\u00e9n\u00e1si","id":"37892083100"},{"name":"Zolt\u00e1n V\u00e1mossy","affiliation":["John von Neumann Faculty of Informatics, \u00d3buda University, Budapest, Hungary"],"firstName":"Zolt\u00e1n","lastName":"V\u00e1mossy","id":"37266876400"},{"name":"Mikl\u00f3s Kozlovszky","affiliation":["Laboratory of Parallel and Distributed Computing, MTA SZTAKI, Budapest, Hungary"],"firstName":"Mikl\u00f3s","lastName":"Kozlovszky","id":"37893267400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-4519-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-4520-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-4518-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2156-8790"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2156-8804"}],"articleNumber":"6319460","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":158},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optimization","Genetic algorithms","Gold","Standards","Medical services","Shape","Databases"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biological tissues","genetic algorithms","medical image processing","statistical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithm","region growing parameter optimization","microscopic tissue images","special immunodiagnostic-evaluation software products","statistical analysis","feature extraction","biomedical image processing","nuclei detection"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["biomedical image processing","nuclei detection","region growing","optimization","genetic algorithm"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6319460","abstract":"The processing of microscopic tissue images is nowadays done more and more using special immunodiagnostic-evaluation software products.

Due to the large number of parameters and due to the big set of possible values setting those parameters manually is a quite hard task, so we developed a genetic algorithm to optimize these values.

To maintain the authority of ownership, it needs robust watermarking techniques in which the embedded data is not easily damaged if the image has been manipulated. Meanwhile, to detect the authenticity of the image, it needs fragile watermarking technique in which the embedded data is easily damaged if the image has been manipulated.

To achieve this, the radios must (a) synchronize their independent clocks, (b) estimate their positions relative to each other, and (c) estimate the range and angular orientation of their constellation to the steering direction. These parameters are estimated from GPS measurements and measurements of time-difference of arrival of inter-radio messages and of the transceiver emissions. A Kalman filter is used to blend the measurements and propagate the transmit node and transceiver states through the beamforming phase.

A common method for performing this task is to use an Exponentially Weighted Moving Average (EWMA), which smooths out the minor variations of the data stream. While EWMA is efficient at processing high-rate streams, it can be very volatile to abrupt transient changes in the data, losing utility for appropriately detecting anomalies. In this paper we present a probabilistic approach to EWMA which dynamically adapts the weighting based on the observation probability. This results in robustness to data anomalies yet quick adaptability to distributional data shifts.","doi":"10.1109/SSP.2012.6319708","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE Statistical Signal Processing Workshop (SSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE Statistical Signal Processing Workshop (SSP)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6310431/6319629/06319708.pdf","startPage":"377","endPage":"380","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SSP.2012.6319708","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6319629","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Probabilistic reasoning for streaming anomaly detection","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6319708","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 Aug. 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6319708/","displayDocTitle":"Probabilistic reasoning for streaming anomaly detection","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2012","accessionNumber":"13037680","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6319708/","conferenceDate":"5-8 Aug. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"04 October 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Probabilistic reasoning for streaming anomaly detection","confLoc":"Ann Arbor, MI, USA","sourcePdf":"p377carter.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.033093S","chronDate":"5-8 Aug. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6310431","isNumber":"6319629","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6310431","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"6319629","articleId":"6319708","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6319710,"authors":[{"name":"Yupeng Liu","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, State University of New Jersey, Rutgers, USA"],"firstName":"Yupeng","lastName":"Liu","id":"37578003700"},{"name":"Athina P.

Under source-eavesdropper channel uncertainty, we derive the optimal source covariance matrix that maximizes the secrecy rate subject to probability of outage and power constraints.

In [1] a p-value estimator is proposed which is based on ranking some statistic over all data samples, and is shown to be asymptotically consistent. Relying on this framework we propose a new statistic for p-value estimation. It is based on the average of K nearest neighbor (K-NN) distances of \u03b7 within a K-NN graph constructed from n nominal training samples. We also provide a bootstrapping strategy for estimating p-values which leads to better robustness. We then theoretically justify the asymptotic consistency of our ideas through a finite sample analysis.

In order to exploit this sparse structure and make it more feasible for practical applications, this article investigates sparse channel estimation for OFDM from the perspective of Bayesian learning. Under the Bayesian learning framework, the large-scale compressed sensing problem, as well as large time delay for the estimation of the doubly selective channel over multiple consecutive OFDM symbols, can be avoided. In addition, the time-varying channel can be tracked naturally by iteratively updating the maximum likelihood function of the channel impulse response.

For the two-user case, a particular class of joint triangularization (JT) can be applied to obtain the optimal design for the joint optimization problem with quality of service (QoS) constraints, namely, the Minimum Power JT broadcast DFE transceiver (MPJT).

Relocate-on-write requires a garbage-collection process, which results in additional write operations referred to as write-amplification. The reclaiming policy that selects the blocks to garbage-collect is greedy if it is based only on the amount of free space to be gained-Write amplification is a critical factor limiting the write performance and endurance in solid-state drives and the greedy garbage collection policy minimizes it. In this paper, we derive an expression for the steady-state distribution of valid-pages using a novel probabilistic model for flash-based SSDs for a greedy reclaiming policy. This distribution lends itself directly to evaluation of write-amplification and gives insight into designing newer garbage collection policies, which would further reduce write-amplification. Numerical evaluation of the derived expression matches the distribution obtained via Monte-Carlo simulation for several different drive configurations, thereby validating the derivation.","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE Statistical Signal Processing Workshop (SSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE Statistical Signal Processing Workshop (SSP)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6310431/6319629/06319743.pdf","startPage":"500","endPage":"503","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the distribution of valid pages with greedy garbage collection for NAND flash","doi":"10.1109/SSP.2012.6319743","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6319629","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SSP.2012.6319743","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6319743","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6319743/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 Aug. 2012","displayDocTitle":"On the distribution of valid pages with greedy garbage collection for NAND flash","dateOfInsertion":"04 October 2012","publicationDate":"Aug. 2012","accessionNumber":"13037715","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"5-8 Aug. 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6319743/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the distribution of valid pages with greedy garbage collection for NAND flash","confLoc":"Ann Arbor, MI, USA","sourcePdf":"p500peleato.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054332S","chronDate":"5-8 Aug. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6310431","isNumber":"6319629","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6310431","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6319629","articleId":"6319743","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6319753,"authors":[{"name":"Piya Pal","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, MC 136-93, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Piya","lastName":"Pal","id":"37391107500"},{"name":"P.

Existing work along this line adopts a deterministic model for the radar signals, which may not be effective to cope with fading propagation and signal correlation in practical scenarios. This paper takes a stochastic approach by modeling the target scenes as random processes that are possibly correlated. A new stochastic framework of compressed sensing for MIMO radar is developed for reconstructing useful statistics of the random target scenes using a small number of samples. The proposed approach directly extracts the useful statistics for estimation without reconstructing the random signals; as a result, it is computationally more efficient and requires a smaller number of samples than existing deterministic approach to compressed sensing.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Compressed sensing for MIMO radar: A stochastic perspective","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE Statistical Signal Processing Workshop (SSP)","doi":"10.1109/SSP.2012.6319756","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE Statistical Signal Processing Workshop (SSP)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6310431/6319629/06319756.pdf","startPage":"548","endPage":"551","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SSP.2012.6319756","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6319629","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6319756","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6319756/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 Aug. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Compressed sensing for MIMO radar: A stochastic perspective","conferenceDate":"5-8 Aug. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6319756/","dateOfInsertion":"04 October 2012","publicationDate":"Aug. 2012","accessionNumber":"13037728","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Compressed sensing for MIMO radar: A stochastic perspective","confLoc":"Ann Arbor, MI, USA","sourcePdf":"p548tian.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058435S","chronDate":"5-8 Aug. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6310431","isNumber":"6319629","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6310431","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"6319629","articleId":"6319756","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6319764,"authors":[{"name":"Yujiao Zheng","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Syracuse University, Syracuse, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Yujiao","lastName":"Zheng","id":"37859477300"},{"name":"Ruixin Niu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, VA, USA"],"firstName":"Ruixin","lastName":"Niu","id":"38474979100"},{"name":"Pramod K.

Informative measurements are selected by the per-sensor censoring process executed at the sensors at each time. Though the less informative measurements are not sent to the FC, their absence still conveys some information, and the proposed scheme exploits such information from the missing message to achieve better inference performance.

The performance of the estimation is usually quantified by some standard error metric such as squared error or support error. In this paper, we consider a noisy compressed sensing problem with any arbitrary error metric. We propose a simple, fast, and general algorithm that estimates the original signal by minimizing an arbitrary error metric defined by the user. We verify that, owing to the decoupling principle, our algorithm is optimal, and we describe a general method to compute the fundamental information-theoretic performance limit for any well-defined error metric. We provide an example where the metric is absolute error and give the theoretical performance limit for it. The experimental results show that our algorithm outperforms methods such as relaxed belief propagation, and reaches the suggested theoretical limit for our example error metric.","doi":"10.1109/SSP.2012.6319767","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE Statistical Signal Processing Workshop (SSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE Statistical Signal Processing Workshop (SSP)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6310431/6319629/06319767.pdf","startPage":"588","endPage":"591","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SSP.2012.6319767","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6319629","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal estimation with arbitrary error metrics in compressed sensing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6319767","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 Aug. 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6319767/","displayDocTitle":"Optimal estimation with arbitrary error metrics in compressed sensing","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2012","accessionNumber":"13037739","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6319767/","conferenceDate":"5-8 Aug. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"04 October 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal estimation with arbitrary error metrics in compressed sensing","confLoc":"Ann Arbor, MI, USA","sourcePdf":"p588tan.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.093167S","chronDate":"5-8 Aug. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6310431","isNumber":"6319629","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6310431","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6319629","articleId":"6319767","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6319770,"authors":[{"name":"Joshua N.

We present a test statistic for subspace detection using compressive samples and demonstrate that the probability of error of the proposed detector decreases exponentially in the number of compressive samples, provided that the energy off the subspace scales as n. Using information-theoretic lower bounds, we demonstrate that no other detector can achieve the same probability of error for weaker signals.

Some existing works model bistatic path gains as identically and independently distributed random variables, and the known distinct features between propagation paths are neglected. Based on the bistatic radar equation, a path gain is a product of target reflection gain and propagation loss. Since the latter depends on geometry and system parameters, the true path gains are not necessarily identically distributed. In this paper, the propagation loss is incorporated into the MIMO radar signal model and the binary hypothesis test is explored. The test statistic is a sum of weighted Chi-square random variables under either hypothesis, and its distribution is a Gamma mixture. The probabilities of detection and false alarm can be explicitly obtained. In addition, a saddlepoint approximation based performance analysis is suggested, and it may be less sensitive to numerical errors, particularly when weighting coefficients are similar.","doi":"10.1109/SSP.2012.6319819","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE Statistical Signal Processing Workshop (SSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE Statistical Signal Processing Workshop (SSP)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6310431/6319629/06319819.pdf","startPage":"776","endPage":"779","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SSP.2012.6319819","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6319629","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MIMO radar detection with heterogeneous propagation losses","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6319819","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 Aug. 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6319819/","displayDocTitle":"MIMO radar detection with heterogeneous propagation losses","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2012","accessionNumber":"13037791","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6319819/","conferenceDate":"5-8 Aug. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"04 October 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MIMO radar detection with heterogeneous propagation losses","confLoc":"Ann Arbor, MI, USA","sourcePdf":"p776song.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072379S","chronDate":"5-8 Aug. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6310431","isNumber":"6319629","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6310431","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6319629","articleId":"6319819","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6319821,"authors":[{"name":"N.

Thus increasing lifetime of flash memory via signal processing techniques is an important research area. The first half of the paper presents a statistical method for estimating the health of the cells in a Flash memory, based on which a variable error correction coding scheme can be used to increase lifetime. The second half of the paper proposes a statistical approach to increase lifetime when the flash controller can dynamically vary the program and erase operation strategy. This approach uses Markov Decision Processes (MDP) to choose the optimal program or erase strategy at any given point in the life of a Flash memory based on its current state or health. From a bigger picture stand-point, the paper presents a novel way of flash management using a Markov model for health of the memory at any given point in its lifetime.","doi":"10.1109/SSP.2012.6319823","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE Statistical Signal Processing Workshop (SSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE Statistical Signal Processing Workshop (SSP)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6310431/6319629/06319823.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SSP.2012.6319823","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6319629","startPage":"788","endPage":"791","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Probabilistic graphical model for flash memory programming","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6319823","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Probabilistic graphical model for flash memory programming","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 Aug. 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6319823/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"5-8 Aug. 2012","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2012","accessionNumber":"13037795","dateOfInsertion":"04 October 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6319823/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Probabilistic graphical model for flash memory programming","confLoc":"Ann Arbor, MI, USA","sourcePdf":"p788peleato.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.036971S","chronDate":"5-8 Aug. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6310431","isNumber":"6319629","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6310431","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6319629","articleId":"6319823","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6319825,"authors":[{"name":"Nelson Antunes","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics, University of Algarve, Faro, Portugal"],"firstName":"Nelson","lastName":"Antunes","id":"37605473000"},{"name":"Vladas Pipiras","affiliation":["Department of Statistics and Operations Research, North Carolina State University, Chapel Hill, NC, USA"],"firstName":"Vladas","lastName":"Pipiras","id":"37573428800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0182-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0181-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2373-0803"}],"articleNumber":"6319825","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":102},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Estimation","Sampling methods","Probabilistic logic","Internet","Random variables","Educational institutions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Internet","statistical distributions","telecommunication traffic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["flow distributions estimation tails estimation","size distributions","asymptotic equivalence","flow duration distribution tail","probabilistic model","flow size distribution tail","Internet"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Traffic measurements","packet sampling","flow duration","flow size","heavy-tailed distributions"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6319825","doi":"10.1109/SSP.2012.6319825","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SSP.2012.6319825","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6319629","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE Statistical Signal Processing Workshop (SSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE Statistical Signal Processing Workshop (SSP)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6310431/6319629/06319825.pdf","startPage":"796","endPage":"799","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Estimation of flow distributions tails from sampled traffic","abstract":"This paper addresses the problem of estimating the tails of flow duration and size distributions under various sampling methods.

We show that the desired steering vector can be estimated in closed form from a convex optimization problem by making use of the subspace principle. As this method is developed based on an extended version of the orthonormal PAST (OPAST), the steering vector can be recursively estimated with very low complexity and moving sources can be handled. To further improve the performance of beamforming, the uncertainty of the array covariance matrix is taken into account. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed method performs well in the presence of uncertainties.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 Aug. 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6319842/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"13037814","publicationDate":"Aug. 2012","conferenceDate":"5-8 Aug. 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6319842/","dateOfInsertion":"04 October 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Steering vector estimation and beamforming under uncertainties","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Steering vector estimation and beamforming under uncertainties","confLoc":"Ann Arbor, MI, USA","sourcePdf":"p85liao.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069537S","chronDate":"5-8 Aug. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6310431","isNumber":"6319629","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6310431","xplore-issue":"6319629","articleId":"6319842","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6319843,"authors":[{"name":"Foroohar Foroozan","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, York University, Toronto, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Foroohar","lastName":"Foroozan","id":"37284434500"},{"name":"Amir Asif","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, York University, Toronto, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Amir","lastName":"Asif","id":"37267165100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0182-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0181-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2373-0803"}],"articleNumber":"6319843","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":307},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO radar","Doppler effect","Arrays","Maximum likelihood estimation","MIMO","Vectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","diversity reception","maximum likelihood estimation","MIMO radar"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["time reversal MIMO radar","time reversal based angle-Doppler estimators","spatial diversity","multipath propagation","TRAD/MIMO radars","angle-Doppler diversity","target localization","radar maximum likelihood estimator","MLE","adaptive beamforming techniques"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Time Reversal","DOA Estimation","Doppler Frequency","MIMO radar","Space-Time Adaptive Processing","Multipath"]}],"abstract":"This paper designs time reversal (TR) based angle-Doppler estimators for multiple-input-multiple-output (TRAD/MIMO) radars with the goal of using the spatial diversity of multipath propagation in urban scenarios to their advantage.
