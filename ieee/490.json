A major challenge, however, is training the ATR algorithm to the specific environment and mission. Because of the wide range of operating conditions encountered in practice, advanced training based on a pre-selected training set may not provide the robust performance needed. Training on a mission-specific image set is a promising approach, but requires rapid selection of a small, but highly representative training set to support time-critical operations. To remedy these problems and make short-notice seeker missions a reality, we developed learning and mining using bagged augmented decision trees (LAMBAST). LAMBAST examines large databases and extracts sparse, representative subsets of target and clutter samples of interest. For data mining, LAMBAST uses a variant of decision trees, called random decision trees (RDTs). This approach guards against overfitting and can incorporate novel, mission-specific data after initial training via perpetual learning. We augment these trees with a distribution modeling component that eliminates redundant information, ignores misrepresentative class distributions in the database, and stops training when decision boundaries are sufficiently sampled. These augmented random decision trees enable fast investigation of multiple images to train a reliable, mission-specific ATR. This paper presents the augmented random decision tree framework, develops the sampling procedure for efficient construction of the sample, and illustrates the procedure using relevant examples.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4906435","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AIPR.2008.4906452","publicationTitle":"2008 37th IEEE Applied Imagery Pattern Recognition Workshop","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 37th IEEE Applied Imagery Pattern Recognition Workshop","pdfPath":"/iel5/4816041/4906435/04906452.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","doi":"10.1109/AIPR.2008.4906452","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Rapid training of image classifiers through adaptive, multi-frame sampling method","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 Oct. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Rapid training of image classifiers through adaptive, multi-frame sampling method","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"15-17 Oct. 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4906452/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10615679","dateOfInsertion":"02 May 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4906452/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Rapid training of image classifiers through adaptive, multi-frame sampling method","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"Lowell-AIPR_2008_LAMBAST_IEEE_Formatting.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054493S","chronDate":"15-17 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4816041","isNumber":"4906435","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4816041","xplore-issue":"4906435","articleId":"4906452","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":4906464,"authors":[{"name":"Jesse Scott","affiliation":["Electronic and Computer Services, Pennslyvania State University, University Park, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Jesse","lastName":"Scott","id":"37401569600"},{"name":"Michael Pusateri","affiliation":["Electronic and Computer Services, Pennslyvania State University, University Park, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Pusateri","id":"37282710300"},{"name":"Muhammad Umar Mushtaq","affiliation":["Electronic and Computer Services, Pennslyvania State University, University Park, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Muhammad Umar","lastName":"Mushtaq","id":"37626973300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3125-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3126-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-5219"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2332-5615"}],"articleNumber":"4906464","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":574},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hardware","Delay","Clocks","Sorting","Stereo vision","Image analysis","Throughput","Digital filters","Digital images","Computer vision"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image denoising","image enhancement","median filters","stereo image processing","video signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["2D median filter hardware implementation","real-time stereo video","2D spatial median filter","core algorithm","impulse noise removal","digital image processing","computer vision","infrared sensors","intensifier noise","optimal power usage","median filtering","maximum clock rates","resource utilization","radix sort-based elimination algorithm","systolic sorting array","Batcher sorting network","hardware sorting","field programmable gate arrays","pixel clock pulse"]}],"abstract":"The two-dimensional spatial median filter is a core algorithm for impulse noise removal in digital image processing and computer vision. While the literature presents several analyses of median filters optimized for a standard 3 times 3 pixel neighborhood configuration, a 5 times 5 neighborhood, useful for imagery exhibiting noise not conforming to the classic ldquosalt and pepperrdquo formation, has received little analysis. Research efforts on hardware implementations of median filters have been devoted primarily toward implementations with low latency and high throughput. We are developing a system that includes stereo visible near infrared sensors; both require a 5 times 5 median filter to handle intensifier noise. Since the system is a battery powered unit, optimal power usage is a critical requirement in addition to low latency and high throughput. However, optimal power usage for median filtering has received little attention in the literature. In this paper, we focus on investigating four selected hardware implementations of a 5 times 5 median filter and compare them on the basis of power efficiency. We also analyze the latency, maximum clock rates, and resource utilization for these implementations. The designs include implementations of merge sort and radix sort-based elimination algorithms, common in software implementation of median filters, and a systolic sorting array and a Batcher sorting network, common hardware sorting techniques. All designs were created in the Altera Quartus-II environment for Stratix-II field programmable gate arrays, and were designed to be fully pipelined, accepting input sets and generating median filter output values every pixel clock pulse. Of the four considered designs, the Batcher network is a clear winner in power efficiency. Also, the Batcher network exceeds the functional and performance requirements for resource usage, latency, and clock rate.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Comparison of 2D median filter hardware implementations for real-time stereo video","publicationTitle":"2008 37th IEEE Applied Imagery Pattern Recognition Workshop","doi":"10.1109/AIPR.2008.4906464","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 37th IEEE Applied Imagery Pattern Recognition Workshop","pdfPath":"/iel5/4816041/4906435/04906464.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AIPR.2008.4906464","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4906435","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4906464","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4906464/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 Oct. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Comparison of 2D median filter hardware implementations for real-time stereo video","conferenceDate":"15-17 Oct. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4906464/","dateOfInsertion":"02 May 2009","publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10626197","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparison of 2D median filter hardware implementations for real-time stereo video","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"Scott-ComparisonPID788658.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.115364S","chronDate":"15-17 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4816041","isNumber":"4906435","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4816041","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"4906435","articleId":"4906464","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4906476,"authors":[{"name":"Jin Wang","affiliation":["Center for Advanced Technology and Education College of Engineering and Computing, Florida International University, Miami, FL, USA"],"lastName":"Jin Wang","id":"37634920100"},{"name":"Yu Chen","affiliation":["Center for Advanced Technology and Education College of Engineering and Computing, Florida International University, Miami, FL, USA"],"lastName":"Yu Chen","id":"37635415900"},{"name":"Malek Adjouadi","affiliation":["Center for Advanced Technology and Education College of Engineering and Computing, Florida International University, Miami, FL, USA"],"firstName":"Malek","lastName":"Adjouadi","id":"37285029100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3125-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3126-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-5219"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2332-5615"}],"articleNumber":"4906476","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":200},"abstract":"Motivated by the application of the 2D principal component analysis (PCA) for face recognition, this study proposes a modified multilinear PCA method as means to provide higher accuracy with comparable processing time in contrast to the results of contemporary methods.

The utilization of fault current limiters (FCLs) in power system provides an effective way to suppress fault currents and results in considerable saving in the investment of high capacity circuit breakers. To enhance system security and improve protection system design in electric ships, an active FCL is proposed in this paper to suppress fault currents. A formula to determine smallest active FCL impedance required for fault current reduction under circuit breakers' interrupting ratings is derived by using an impedance matrix modify method. Performance of the proposed method is ensured using a practical electric ship power system. Effect of the locations for FCL installation on fault currents is also illustrated.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fault current limiter allocation in electric ship power systems","doi":"10.1109/ESTS.2009.4906493","startPage":"53","endPage":"58","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ESTS.2009.4906493","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4906480","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Electric Ship Technologies Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Electric Ship Technologies Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/4839121/4906480/04906493.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4906493","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4906493/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"Fault current limiter allocation in electric ship power systems","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4906493/","dateOfInsertion":"02 May 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10626271","conferenceDate":"20-22 April 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fault current limiter allocation in electric ship power systems","confLoc":"Baltimore, MD, USA","sourcePdf":"07_6026.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057638S","chronDate":"20-22 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4839121","isNumber":"4906480","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4839121","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4906480","articleId":"4906493","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4906503,"authors":[{"name":"Ahmad Arshan Khan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Florida International University, Miami, FL, USA"],"firstName":"Ahmad Arshan","lastName":"Khan","id":"37632631800"},{"name":"Osama Mohammed","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Florida International University, Miami, FL, USA"],"firstName":"Osama","lastName":"Mohammed","id":"37283694100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3438-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3439-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4906503","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":171},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Frequency estimation","Neural networks","Acoustic noise","Synchronous motors","Signal processing algorithms","Sensorless control","Voltage","Rotors","Impedance","Data mining"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electric machine analysis computing","neural nets","permanent magnet motors","synchronous motors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high frequency injection based position estimation","permanent magnet synchronous motors","low speed high frequency injection","feed-forward neural network"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4906503","abstract":"In this paper, the relationship between injected voltages, audible noise and position estimation error is investigated for low speed high frequency injection based position sensorless control of PM synchronous motors.

In recent years, the Navy has been seeking an automated damage control and power system management approach for future reconfigurable shipboard power systems. This paper presents a dynamic formulation and a static implementation of a new damage control method at the DC zonal integrated fight through power system level. The method used a constrained binary genetic algorithm to find an optimal network configuration. System operating limits act as constraints in the static damage control implementation. Off-line studies were conducted using an example power system modeled in PSCAD to evaluate the effectiveness of the damage control method. The simulation results for case studies showed that, in most cases, the proposed damage algorithm was able to find the optimal network configuration that restores the power system network without violating the power system operating constraints.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 April 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4906522/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10626300","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4906522/","publicationDate":"April 2009","dateOfInsertion":"02 May 2009","conferenceDate":"20-22 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Genetic algorithm based damage control for shipboard power systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Genetic algorithm based damage control for shipboard power systems","confLoc":"Baltimore, MD, USA","sourcePdf":"36_6079.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.092238S","chronDate":"20-22 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4839121","isNumber":"4906480","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4839121","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4906480","articleId":"4906522","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4906524,"authors":[{"name":"Ricky R.

In this paper, a simplified modeling approach based on the fundamental power limitations is set forth. The power flow problem is posed as a linear programming problem which is solved using a simplex method.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A linear programming approach to shipboard electrical system modeling","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Electric Ship Technologies Symposium","doi":"10.1109/ESTS.2009.4906524","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Electric Ship Technologies Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/4839121/4906480/04906524.pdf","startPage":"261","endPage":"269","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ESTS.2009.4906524","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4906480","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4906524","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4906524/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"A linear programming approach to shipboard electrical system modeling","conferenceDate":"20-22 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4906524/","dateOfInsertion":"02 May 2009","publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10626302","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A linear programming approach to shipboard electrical system modeling","confLoc":"Baltimore, MD, USA","sourcePdf":"38_6057.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070055S","chronDate":"20-22 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4839121","isNumber":"4906480","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4839121","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"4906480","articleId":"4906524","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4906534,"authors":[{"name":"Timothy J.

In a highly-integrated dc power system, the preponderance of power converters connecting several loads with power ranging from (W) to (MW) levels rises additional concerns about the effects of a dc fault on other loads connected to the same bus or adjacent buses. Equally critical are the interactions between these power converters during the fault isolation and clearance process. In order to address some of these issues, a basic model has been constructed to study the behavior and effects of dc faults in an MVDC power system for an all-electric ship.

This is because SSCBs offer many advantages to electrical systems that conventional Electro-Mechanical Circuit Breakers (EMCBs) cannot. These advantages include much faster interruption of overcurrents, based on lower current thresholds and/or di/dt rate of current rise; reduced energy flowing into the electrical system during faults; and reduced system ringing during fault interruptions. Additional advantages of SSCBs are the elimination of electrical arcing, which is particularly useful for DC and higher voltage distribution systems and systems in environments with volatile gases or explosives; reduced acoustic noise and Electro-Magnetic Interference (EMI) levels during circuit breaker switching; and reduced maintenance and lifecycle costs during the typical 40-year lifetime of the ship. This paper describes the advantages and disadvantages of SSCBs using IGCTs, SSCBs using IGBTs and conventional EMCBs. It will also describe the differences between IGCTs and IGBTs and will consider the design of the bus voltage snubber. This paper will also show how redesigning the ship's electrical system, while considering these important issues, can result in a more reliable, cost-effective power distribution system for the ship.","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Electric Ship Technologies Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Electric Ship Technologies Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/4839121/4906480/04906543.pdf","startPage":"400","endPage":"405","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"IGCTs vs. IGBTs for circuit breakers in advanced ship electrical systems","doi":"10.1109/ESTS.2009.4906543","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4906480","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ESTS.2009.4906543","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4906543","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4906543/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"IGCTs vs. IGBTs for circuit breakers in advanced ship electrical systems","dateOfInsertion":"02 May 2009","publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10626321","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"20-22 April 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4906543/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"IGCTs vs. IGBTs for circuit breakers in advanced ship electrical systems","confLoc":"Baltimore, MD, USA","sourcePdf":"57_6121.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.033821S","chronDate":"20-22 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4839121","isNumber":"4906480","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4839121","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"4906480","articleId":"4906543","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4906547,"authors":[{"name":"Alexander L.

Two scenarios of the pulse load operation, with and without an energy storage system have been addressed. The energy storage used is a flywheel as it has a very fast time response in supplying high power demands. The health of the electric ship power system is monitored by observing key indicators in the components critical to the working such as the generator and propulsion motor. The time-domain simulation of two test cases is carried out in the PSCAD/EMTDC software platform.

The microelectrode layer of MOMD integrating quadrupole electrodes and spiral electrodes is designed for the dielectric measurements of micro particles, while the photoconductor of MOMD is designed for the dynamic manipulation of the particles. The numerical simulation is implemented for the distribution of time-averaged dielectrophoretic force, torque and particle velocities. The results agree well with the experiments in the literature. The numerical results show that both real and imaginary parts of particle effective polarizability alphatilde determining the particle characteristics can be calculated simultaneously through measuring the traveling velocity V\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">r</sub>\n of the particles, which is simpler than previous methods. Moreover, the results also show that the particle travelling velocity, suspension height and electrorotation velocity can all be measured accurately for dielectric characterization with the help of light-induced DEP mechanism integrated on the MOMD.

Sometimes, a sixth wave (U) may follow T. Q, R, and S are grouped together to form the QRS-complex. Detection of these waves is a vital step in ECG signal analysis to extract hidden patterns. Many prior studies have focused only on detection of the QRS-complex, because P and T waves are sparse and harder to isolate from the signal. In this paper, we develop an algorithm to detect all five waves - P, Q, R, S, and T in ECG signals using wavelet transformation. The accuracy for P wave detection is 99.5%, 99.8% for QRS complex, and 99.2% for T waves.","doi":"10.1109/ICCME.2009.4906677","publicationTitle":"2009 ICME International Conference on Complex Medical Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 ICME International Conference on Complex Medical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/4840269/4906571/04906677.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCME.2009.4906677","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4906571","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Detection of P, QRS, and T Components of ECG using wavelet transformation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4906677","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Detection of P, QRS, and T Components of ECG using wavelet transformation","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 April 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4906677/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"9-11 April 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10615832","dateOfInsertion":"02 May 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4906677/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Detection of P, QRS, and T Components of ECG using wavelet transformation","confLoc":"Tempe, AZ, USA","sourcePdf":"10132.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073013S","chronDate":"9-11 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4840269","isNumber":"4906571","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4840269","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"4906571","articleId":"4906677","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4906710,"authors":[{"name":"Viktor Gruev","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Washington University of Saint Louis, Saint Louis, MO, USA"],"firstName":"Viktor","lastName":"Gruev","id":"37269503900"},{"name":"Jan Van der Spiegel","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Systems Engineering, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Jan","lastName":"Van der Spiegel","id":"37284390100"},{"name":"Nader Engheta","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Systems Engineering, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Nader","lastName":"Engheta","id":"37272865400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4292-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4293-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4906710","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":400},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Polarization","Image sensors","Sensor phenomena and characterization","Polymers","Active filters","Information filtering","Information filters","CMOS image sensors","Aluminum","Wires"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomedical optical imaging","CMOS image sensors","focal planes","light polarisation","polymers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["integrated polarization image sensors","focal plane polarization imaging sensors","polymer polarization filters","CMOS active pixel sensor","computes polarization information","aluminum nano wires","material detection"]}],"abstract":"An overview of the latest efforts in integrated polarization imaging sensors are presented.

The Electrocardiogram (ECG) is the most widely adopted clinical tool that measures and records the electrical activity of the heart from the body surface. The mainstream resting ECG machines for CVD diagnosis and supervision can be ineffective in detecting abnormal transient heart activities, which may not occur during an individual's hospital visit. Common Holter-based portable solutions offer 24-hour ECG recording, containing hundreds of thousands of heart beats that not only are tedious and time-consuming to analyze manually but also miss the capability to provide any real-time feedback. In this study, we seek to establish a cell phone-based personalized medicine technology for CVD, capable of performing continuous monitoring and recording of ECG in real time, generating individualized cardiac health summary report in layman's language, automatically detecting abnormal CVD conditions and classifying them at any place and anytime. Specifically, we propose to develop an artificial neural network (ANN)-based machine learning technique, combining both individualized medical information and clinical ECG database data, to train the cell phone to learn to adapt to its user's physiological conditions to achieve better ECG feature extraction and more accurate CVD classification results.","doi":"10.1109/LISSA.2009.4906714","startPage":"80","endPage":"83","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE/NIH Life Science Systems and Applications Workshop","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LISSA.2009.4906714","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4906693","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE/NIH Life Science Systems and Applications Workshop","pdfPath":"/iel5/4850422/4906693/04906714.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"HeartToGo: A Personalized medicine technology for cardiovascular disease prevention and detection","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4906714/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"HeartToGo: A Personalized medicine technology for cardiovascular disease prevention and detection","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4906714/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10615857","publicationDate":"April 2009","dateOfInsertion":"02 May 2009","conferenceDate":"9-10 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-10 April 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"HeartToGo: A Personalized medicine technology for cardiovascular disease prevention and detection","confLoc":"Bethesda, MD, USA","sourcePdf":"rp021-Paper-26.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.0647S","chronDate":"9-10 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4850422","isNumber":"4906693","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4850422","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"4906693","articleId":"4906714","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4906715,"authors":[{"name":"Fei Zhang","affiliation":["Laboratory of Computational Neuroscience, Departments of Neurosurgery, Electrical & Computer Engineering, and Bioengineering, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, USA"],"firstName":"Fei","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37578596800"},{"name":"Xiaoyu Liu","affiliation":["Laboratory of Computational Neuroscience, Departments of Neurosurgery, Electrical & Computer Engineering, and Bioengineering, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, USA"],"firstName":"Xiaoyu","lastName":"Liu","id":"37578829200"},{"name":"Steven A.

The image accuracy and computational complexity are greatly affected by the reconstruction algorithm. This paper aims at providing an efficient reconstruction technique which can be implemented in VLSI for advanced portable devices. Various inhomogeneous absorption models are used in simulations of continuous-wave DOT systems. The accuracy and time consumption are calculated and compared for both frame and sub-frame modes. Mean square errors (MSE) are derived to quantify the accuracy of different modes. Decreasing the complexity of algorithm and enhancing the quality of image can be achieved by adjusting the truncated parameter and reconstructive mode. This study has shown that the sub-frame mode with truncated Jacobi Singular Value Decomposition (TJSVD) algorithm is the method with higher efficiency and better quality. It can also be implemented in VLSI for continuous-wave DOT.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE/NIH Life Science Systems and Applications Workshop","pdfPath":"/iel5/4850422/4906693/04906716.pdf","startPage":"88","endPage":"91","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE/NIH Life Science Systems and Applications Workshop","doi":"10.1109/LISSA.2009.4906716","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LISSA.2009.4906716","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4906693","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4906716","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A VLSI-inspired image reconstruction algorithm for continuous-wave diffuse optical tomography systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image reconstruction","Tomography","US Department of Transportation","Very large scale integration","Computational complexity","Reconstruction algorithms","Absorption","Computational modeling","Mean square error methods","Jacobian matrices"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","image reconstruction","Jacobian matrices","medical image processing","optical tomography","singular value decomposition","VLSI"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["VLSI inspired image reconstruction algorithm","continuous wave diffuse optical tomography","image accuracy","computational complexity","truncated Jacobi Singular Value Decomposition"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4906716/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-10 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"A VLSI-inspired image reconstruction algorithm for continuous-wave diffuse optical tomography systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4906716/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10615858","dateOfInsertion":"02 May 2009","conferenceDate":"9-10 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A VLSI-inspired image reconstruction algorithm for continuous-wave diffuse optical tomography systems","confLoc":"Bethesda, MD, USA","sourcePdf":"rp023-Paper-61.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051835S","chronDate":"9-10 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4850422","isNumber":"4906693","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4850422","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4906693","articleId":"4906716","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4906719,"authors":[{"name":"Miad Faezipour","affiliation":["Quality of Life Technology Laboratory, University of Dallas, Richardson, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Miad","lastName":"Faezipour","id":"37296205600"},{"name":"Tarun M.

Many researches indicate that AES systems should be able to analyze semantic characteristics of an essay and include more such features to score essays. This paper makes an assumption: some concepts that can be regarded as literary concepts would only be utilized by skillful writers. However, it is a difficult task to extract literal concepts due to small size of training corpora. This work uses a semantic network tool to overcome the problem. The concepts in essays can be transformed into sememes using the tool and literary concepts are also transformed into literary sememes. This work introduces a method which makes use of the literary sememes in an essay to score the essay.

The experiments demonstrate that the new model can get better performance than any of the directly trained models.","doi":"10.1109/NLPKE.2008.4906801","publicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Natural Language Processing and Knowledge Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Natural Language Processing and Knowledge Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/4815086/4906745/04906801.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NLPKE.2008.4906801","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4906745","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new method for model selection in speech recognition","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4906801","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-22 Oct. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4906801/","displayDocTitle":"A new method for model selection in speech recognition","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10615652","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4906801/","conferenceDate":"19-22 Oct. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"02 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new method for model selection in speech recognition","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"71.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.082447S","chronDate":"19-22 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4815086","isNumber":"4906745","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4815086","xplore-issue":"4906745","articleId":"4906801","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4906813,"authors":[{"name":"Wei Chen","affiliation":["Pattern Recognition and Intelligent System Laboratory, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Chen","id":"37597883400"},{"name":"Gang Liu","affiliation":["Pattern Recognition and Intelligent System Laboratory, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Gang","lastName":"Liu","id":"37600972900"},{"name":"Jun Guo","affiliation":["Pattern Recognition and Intelligent System Laboratory, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jun","lastName":"Guo","id":"37277255800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2779-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2780-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4515-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4906813","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":66},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Speech recognition","Hidden Markov models","Acoustic measurements","Pattern recognition","Intelligent systems","Laboratories","Training data","Error analysis","Automatic speech recognition","Convergence"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["learning (artificial intelligence)","speech recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["confusion network","confidence measure","active learning","speech recognition systems","transcribed utterances","training data preparation","acoustic modeling","random selection method"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Active learning","Confusion network","Confidence Measure"]}],"abstract":"Speech recognition systems are usually trained using tremendous transcribed utterances, and training data preparation is intensively time-consuming and costly. Aiming at reducing the number of training examples to be labeled, active learning is used in acoustic modeling of speech recognition, this learning scheme iteratively inspects the unlabeled samples, selects the most informative samples corresponding to a certain criterion, then annotates them, and adds the newly transcribed samples to the training set to update the acoustic model. Concerning about the importance of the criterion to select the most informative samples, we proposed a confidence measure computed by confusion network, and used this measure as the criterion for sample selection to improve the efficiency of active learning in acoustic modeling. Our experiments show that active learning, which adopts the proposed confidence measure, can achieve 31% maximum reduction of labeled data compared with random selection method.","doi":"10.1109/NLPKE.2008.4906813","publicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Natural Language Processing and Knowledge Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Natural Language Processing and Knowledge Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/4815086/4906745/04906813.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NLPKE.2008.4906813","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4906745","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A confusion network based confidence measure for active learning in speech recognition","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4906813","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A confusion network based confidence measure for active learning in speech recognition","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-22 Oct. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4906813/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"19-22 Oct. 2008","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10615661","dateOfInsertion":"02 May 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4906813/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A confusion network based confidence measure for active learning in speech recognition","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"88.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.130054S","chronDate":"19-22 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4815086","isNumber":"4906745","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4815086","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4906745","articleId":"4906813","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4906846,"authors":[{"name":"Takayuki Itoh","affiliation":["Ochanomizu University, Japan"],"firstName":"Takayuki","lastName":"Itoh","id":"37537853900"},{"name":"Chris Muelder","affiliation":["University of California, Davis, USA"],"firstName":"Chris","lastName":"Muelder","id":"37299311900"},{"name":"Kwan-Liu Ma","affiliation":["University of California, Davis, USA"],"firstName":"Kwan-Liu","lastName":"Ma","id":"37275869400"},{"name":"Jun Sese","affiliation":["Ochanomizu University, Japan"],"firstName":"Jun","lastName":"Sese","id":"37637298400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4404-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2165-8765"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2165-8773"}],"articleNumber":"4906846","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":29,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":526},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Data visualization","Tree graphs","Social network services","Clustering algorithms","Displays","Performance analysis","Tree data structures","Proteins"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data visualisation","graph theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hybrid space-filling","force-directed layout method","multiple-category graphs visualization","social networks","active biological network dataset","information visualization","hierarchical data visualization"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Information visualization","graph visualization","multiple-category graphs","clustering","force directed layout","space-filling hierarchical data visualization","active biological network"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A hybrid space-filling and force-directed layout method for visualizing multiple-category graphs","doi":"10.1109/PACIFICVIS.2009.4906846","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4906819","endPage":"128","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Pacific Visualization Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Pacific Visualization Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/4816119/4906819/04906846.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PACIFICVIS.2009.4906846","startPage":"121","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4906846","abstract":"Many graphs used in real-world applications consist of nodes belonging to more than one category.

It is often helpful to visualize both connectivity and categories of the graphs simultaneously. In this paper, we present a new visualization technique for multiple-category graphs. The technique firstly constructs hierarchical clusters of the nodes based on both connectivity and categories. It then places the nodes by a new hybrid space-filling and force-directed layout algorithm to clearly display both connectivity and category information.

The antenna structure consists of the chassis of a mobile terminal, a feed structure and a matching circuitry. The chassis is cut in two pieces, which are connected with an inductor. The value of the inductor is tuned so that the lowest resonant frequency of the chassis equals the center frequency of the operating band. The feed structure excites very strongly the resonant wavemode of the chassis and thus very large bandwidth is available. The feed structure can be integrated e.g. on the PCB of a mobile terminal and thus the antenna is very low-profile.

While these powerful ICs enable effective implementation of multiple input multiple output (MIMO) digital processing, the main issue of MIMO RF FEM implementation in small devices such as handsets still remains unsolved. Without such a full solution, network providers cannot deploy next generation wireless broadband networks, such as 3GPP long term evolution (LTE) networks, that can sustain tens of Mbps throughput with mobility. This paper addresses this specific problem by presenting an LTE MIMO air interface solution for handsets using metamaterial designs, which offer small, low-cost, and low-profile antennas printed directly on PCB for easy integration and simple manufacturing - all critical factors for rapid deployment and commercial success. The proposed metamaterial MIMO array consists of dual resonance antennas occupying lambda\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">0</sub>\n/10 times lambda\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">0</sub>\n/41 times lambda\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">0</sub>\n/387 volume at center frequency 771MHz of the LTE band 746-796MHz.

Their extraction from available gene expression profiles is a challenging problem. Such reverse engineering of genetic networks offers insight into cellular activity toward prediction of adverse effects of new drugs or possible identification of new drug targets. Tasks such as classification, clustering, and feature selection enable efficient mining of knowledge about gene interactions in the form of networks. It is known that biological data is prone to different kinds of noise and ambiguity. Soft computing tools, such as fuzzy sets, evolutionary strategies, and neurocomputing, have been found to be helpful in providing low-cost, acceptable solutions in the presence of various types of uncertainties. In this paper, we survey the role of these soft methodologies and their hybridizations, for the purpose of generating genetic networks.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5632051","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCBB.2009.39","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Computational Biology and Bioinformatics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Computational Biology and Bioinformatics","pdfPath":"/iel5/8857/5632051/04906987.pdf","startPage":"94","endPage":"107","doi":"10.1109/TCBB.2009.39","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Genetic Networks and Soft Computing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.-Feb.  2011","displayDocTitle":"Genetic Networks and Soft Computing","volume":"8","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/4906987/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan.-Feb. 2011","accessionNumber":"11640171","dateOfInsertion":"11 November 2010","pubMedId":"21071800","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4906987/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Genetic Networks and Soft Computing","sourcePdf":"ttb2011010094.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.109853S","chronDate":"Jan.-Feb.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"8857","isNumber":"5632051","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8857","citationCount":"46","xplore-issue":"5632051","articleId":"4906987","onlineDate":"02 May 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4906989,"authors":[{"name":"Rong Ge","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics, Statistics, and Computer Science, Marquette University, Milwaukee, WI, USA"],"firstName":"Rong","lastName":"Ge","id":"37281837400"},{"name":"Xizhou Feng","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics, Statistics, and Computer Science, Marquette University, Milwaukee, WI, USA","Network Dynamics and Simulation Science Laboratory, Virginia Technology, Blacksburg, VA, USA"],"firstName":"Xizhou","lastName":"Feng","id":"37403940500"},{"name":"Shuaiwen Song","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Virginia Technology, Blacksburg, VA, USA"],"firstName":"Shuaiwen","lastName":"Song","id":"37629863100"},{"name":"Hung-Ching Chang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Virginia Technology, Blacksburg, VA, USA"],"firstName":"Hung-Ching","lastName":"Chang","id":"37635176100"},{"name":"Dong Li","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Virginia Technology, Blacksburg, VA, USA"],"firstName":"Dong","lastName":"Li","id":"37067314500"},{"name":"Kirk W.

In the past few years, there has been mounting evidence that power usage limits system scale and computing density, and thus, ultimately system performance. However, despite the impact of power and energy on the computer systems community, few studies provide insight to where and how power is consumed on high-performance systems and applications. In previous work, we designed a framework called PowerPack that was the first tool to isolate the power consumption of devices including disks, memory, NICs, and processors in a high-performance cluster and correlate these measurements to application functions. In this work, we extend our framework to support systems with multicore, multiprocessor-based nodes, and then provide in-depth analyses of the energy consumption of parallel applications on clusters of these systems. These analyses include the impacts of chip multiprocessing on power and energy efficiency, and its interaction with application executions. In addition, we use PowerPack to study the power dynamics and energy efficiencies of dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS) techniques on clusters. Our experiments reveal conclusively how intelligent DVFS scheduling can enhance system energy efficiency while maintaining performance.","doi":"10.1109/TPDS.2009.76","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/71/5439161/04906989.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPDS.2009.76","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5439161","startPage":"658","endPage":"671","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"PowerPack: Energy Profiling and Analysis of High-Performance Systems and Applications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4906989","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"PowerPack: Energy Profiling and Analysis of High-Performance Systems and Applications","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4906989/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 May 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"21","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 2010","accessionNumber":"11206085","dateOfInsertion":"29 March 2010","htmlLink":"/document/4906989/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"PowerPack: Energy Profiling and Analysis of High-Performance Systems and Applications","sourcePdf":"ttd2010050658.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.059662S","chronDate":"May  2010","isNumber":"5439161","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"71","citationCount":"252","articleId":"4906989","onlineDate":"02 May 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-29"},{"_id":4906990,"authors":[{"name":"Guofeng Zhang","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of CAD&CG Zijingang Campus, University of Zhejiang, Hangzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/2945/5165577/4906990/4906990-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Guofeng Zhang received the BS degree in computer science from Zhe\njiang University, P.R.

This brings up difficulties of seamlessly modifying video content, for instance, inserting or removing an object. In this paper, we present a new video editing system for creating spatiotemporally consistent and visually appealing refilming effects. Unlike the typical filming practice, our system requires no labor-intensive construction of 3D models/surfaces mimicking the real scene. Instead, it is based on an unsupervised inference of view-dependent depth maps for all video frames. We provide interactive tools requiring only a small amount of user input to perform elementary video content editing, such as separating video layers, completing background scene, and extracting moving objects. These tools can be utilized to produce a variety of visual effects in our system, including but not limited to video composition, \"predatorrdquo effect, bullet-time, depth-of-field, and fog synthesis. Some of the effects can be achieved in real time.","doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2009.47","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2009.47","startPage":"828","endPage":"840","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","pdfPath":"/iel5/2945/5165577/04906990.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5165577","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Refilming with Depth-Inferred Videos","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 May 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.-Oct.  2009","displayDocTitle":"Refilming with Depth-Inferred Videos","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept.-Oct. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"17 July 2009","volume":"15","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4906990/","accessionNumber":"10780752","pubMedId":"19590108","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4906990/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Refilming with Depth-Inferred Videos","sourcePdf":"ttg2009050828.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.183236S","chronDate":"Sept.-Oct.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"2945","isNumber":"5165577","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"2945","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"5165577","articleId":"4906990","onlineDate":"02 May 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4906991,"authors":[{"name":"Wouter M.

We have measured discrimination thresholds with silicone rubber stimuli of differing thickness and compliance. Also, the influence of the finger span is assessed. When compliance is expressed as the Young's modulus, the thresholds in the different conditions follow Weber's law with a Weber fraction of 15 percent. When the surface deformation cue was removed, thresholds more than trebled. Under the assumption of optimal cue combination, this suggests that a large fraction of the information comes from the surface deformation cue. Using a matching experiment, we found that differences in object thickness are correctly taken into account.

In this paper, we study the competitive multiradio multichannel allocation problem in multihop wireless networks in detail. We first analyze that the static noncooperative game and Nash equilibrium (NE) channel allocation scheme are not suitable for the multihop wireless networks. Thus, we model the channel allocation problem as a hybrid game involving both cooperative game and noncooperative game. Within a communication session, it is cooperative; and among sessions, it is noncooperative. We propose the min-max coalition-proof Nash equilibrium (MMCPNE) channel allocation scheme in the game, which aims to maximize the achieved data rates of communication sessions. We analyze the existence of MMCPNE and prove the necessary conditions for MMCPNE. Furthermore, we propose several algorithms that enable the selfish players to converge to MMCPNE. Simulation results show that MMCPNE outperforms NE and coalition-proof Nash equilibrium (CPNE) schemes in terms of the achieved data rates of multihop sessions and the throughput of whole networks due to cooperation gain.","doi":"10.1109/TMC.2009.77","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/7755/5255979/04906996.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5255979","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMC.2009.77","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","startPage":"1454","endPage":"1468","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiradio Channel Allocation in Multihop Wireless Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4906996","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 May 2009","displayDocTitle":"Multiradio Channel Allocation in Multihop Wireless Networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4906996/","volume":"8","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/4906996/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","accessionNumber":"10879863","dateOfInsertion":"22 September 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiradio Channel Allocation in Multihop Wireless Networks","sourcePdf":"ttm2009111454.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.093331S","chronDate":"Nov.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"7755","isNumber":"5255979","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7755","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"5255979","articleId":"4906996","onlineDate":"02 May 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4907017,"authors":[{"name":"Nelson Jesus Muga","affiliation":["The Departamento de F\u00edsica, Universidade de Aveiro, Portugal"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/50/5170198/4907017/4907017-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Nelson Jesus Muga was born in Mogadouro, Portugal, in 1980.

The physical meaning of the soft source is well understood and its analytical solution is known, whereas there is no analytical solution for the hard source excitation. Nevertheless, many FDTD works utilize the hard source for its practicality. A novel aspect is that the derivation of a field radiated from the hard source towards the free space is identical to the field radiated from the soft source, provided that a certain relationship holds between the source excitations. This provides us with an analytical solution for the field radiated from the hard source. The assessment of accuracy is then considered for a wide band field radiated from a punctual source into frequency-dependent FDTD Debye media. The quantification of the deviation of the waveform observed in the FDTD space from the analytical solution is demonstrated. The numerical experiments with this quantification show that the waveform observed with the soft source excitation matches the one with the hard source excitation when the minimum wavelength to the spatial discretization ratio is greater than 10. It turns out that the soft source outperforms the hard source when the minimum wavelength relative to the spatial discretization is less than 10 in the case of lossless media. Equivalent accuracy is achievable for both lossless and lossy media even when the minimum wavelength to the spatial discretization ratio is lower than 10 due to the loss tangent which absorbs the spurious frequencies related to the numerical noise.","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2009.2021882","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8/5159551/04907029.pdf","startPage":"2014","endPage":"2022","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2009.2021882","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5159551","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Comparison of FDTD Hard Source With FDTD Soft Source and Accuracy Assessment in Debye Media","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4907029","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 May 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4907029/","displayDocTitle":"Comparison of FDTD Hard Source With FDTD Soft Source and Accuracy Assessment in Debye Media","volume":"57","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 2009","accessionNumber":"10774625","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4907029/","dateOfInsertion":"07 July 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparison of FDTD Hard Source With FDTD Soft Source and Accuracy Assessment in Debye Media","sourcePdf":"57tap07-fcosten-2021882.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.080674S","chronDate":"July  2009","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"5159551","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"5159551","articleId":"4907029","onlineDate":"02 May 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4907040,"authors":[{"name":"Ngoc Tinh Nguyen","affiliation":["Institut d Electronique et de T\u00e9l\u00e9communications de Rennes IETR, UMR CNRS 6164, Universit\u00e9 de Rennes, Rennes, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8/5159551/4907040/4907040-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ngoc Tinh Nguyen was born in Binh Dinh, Vietnam, in 1982.

To this end we investigate numerically the radiation performance of millimeter wave ILAs coated with multiple anti reflection layers. We propose lens structures of moderate size (four wavelengths in diameter at the center frequency) and made from a dense dielectric material (ceramic). They are illuminated by two kinds of on-axis primary sources, namely a dielectric-loaded metallic waveguide and a patch antenna. This enables to assess the role of the lens illumination law on the performance of broadband ILAs. In particular, we demonstrate that ILAs coated with three stacked quarter wavelength matching layers exhibit a very broadband promising features. First their radiation characteristics remain very stable over a large frequency band: a 36% relative bandwidth is achieved using dielectric-loaded waveguide feeds. Secondly very high values of aperture efficiencies (beyond 91% over a 21% bandwidth) are obtained using printed feeds. The truncation effects of the ground plane and substrate of planar feeds upon the beam characteristics are also studied. We conclude that they must be taken into account at the very first stages of the design process of ILAs.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8/5159551/04907040.pdf","startPage":"1907","endPage":"1913","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2009.2021884","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2009.2021884","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5159551","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4907040","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Very Broadband Extended Hemispherical Lenses: Role of Matching Layers for Bandwidth Enlargement","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Lenses","Bandwidth","Broadband antennas","Feeds","Frequency","Dielectric substrates","Optical design","Design optimization","Optical reflection","Dielectric materials"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna radiation patterns","antireflection coatings","dielectric-loaded antennas","dielectric-loaded waveguides","lens antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["very broadband extended hemispherical lenses","matching layers","bandwidth enlargement","integrated lens antennas","radiation performance","millimeter wave ILA","multiple anti reflection layers","dielectric-loaded metallic waveguide","patch antenna","substrate lenses"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Broadband integrated lens antennas","matching layers","millimeter wave","substrate lenses"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4907040/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 May 2009","displayDocTitle":"Very Broadband Extended Hemispherical Lenses: Role of Matching Layers for Bandwidth Enlargement","volume":"57","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/4907040/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2009","accessionNumber":"10774643","dateOfInsertion":"07 July 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Very Broadband Extended Hemispherical Lenses: Role of Matching Layers for Bandwidth Enlargement","sourcePdf":"57tap07-rsauleau-2021884.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.090667S","chronDate":"July  2009","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"5159551","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"41","xplore-issue":"5159551","articleId":"4907040","onlineDate":"02 May 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4907047,"authors":[{"name":"Elio Salvadori","affiliation":["Center of Research and Telecommunication Experimentation, Networked Communities, Trento, Italy"],"bio":{"p":["Elio Salvadori received the degree in Telecommunications Engineering from Politecnico di Milano, Italy in 1997 and the Ph.D. degree from University of Trento, Italy, in 2005.

This paper presents impairment-aware distributed optical control plane (OCP) based on enhancements to resource reservation protocol-traffic engineering (RSVP-TE) signaling protocol (S-OCP). In particular, four architectural options [K-sequential (K-SEQ), K-parallel (K-PAR), hop-by-hop (HbH), and full flooding (FF)] within the S-OCP approach are defined and compared. Simulation results show that a combination of HbH routing and feasibility check can be considered as a good compromise both in terms of blocking probability and control plane overhead. The feasibility of a signaling-based approach for the control plane is further demonstrated by comparing simulation results with the results obtained from the implementation of the proposed architectural options in a commercial generalized multiprotocol label switching (GMPLS) protocol emulator. Furthermore, we argue that the real networks will rarely be homogeneous concerning transponder types, creating the need for a transponder selection policy at the end nodes. We introduce and compare two policies: best-first and worst-first. The results obtained from our experiments show that a worst-first policy for selecting transponders can save up to 50% enhanced transponders thereby reducing the overall cost.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4907047/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July1,  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 May 2009","volume":"27","issue":"13","accessionNumber":"10733072","publicationDate":"July1, 2009","dateOfInsertion":"26 June 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4907047/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Distributed Optical Control Plane Architectures for Handling Transmission Impairments in Transparent Optical Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed Optical Control Plane Architectures for Handling Transmission Impairments in Transparent Optical Networks","sourcePdf":"jlt-salvadori-2006066.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.105599S","chronDate":"July1,  2009","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"5133707","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"5133707","articleId":"4907047","onlineDate":"02 May 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4907051,"authors":[{"name":"Mohamed H.

We show that by using at most one extra electromagnetic (EM) simulation, the sensitivities of the complete time domain EM response can be obtained with respect to all designable parameters regardless of their number and regardless of the number of time steps. The complete time domain signature of a certain structure can thus be efficiently and accurately predicted for perturbed structures. Our sensitivities match those obtained using the accurate and time intensive central finite differences (CFD). The adjoint sensitivities are used in the solution of inverse problems through a number of approaches exploiting surrogate model optimization and direct optimization. Our technique enables efficient identification of object position, dimensions and material properties.","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2009.2021897","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8/5159551/04907051.pdf","startPage":"2137","endPage":"2146","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2009.2021897","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5159551","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adjoint First Order Sensitivities of Transient Responses and Their Applications in the Solution of Inverse Problems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4907051","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 May 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4907051/","displayDocTitle":"Adjoint First Order Sensitivities of Transient Responses and Their Applications in the Solution of Inverse Problems","volume":"57","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 2009","accessionNumber":"10774636","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4907051/","dateOfInsertion":"07 July 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adjoint First Order Sensitivities of Transient Responses and Their Applications in the Solution of Inverse Problems","sourcePdf":"57tap07-mbakr-2021897.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.069033S","chronDate":"July  2009","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"5159551","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"5159551","articleId":"4907051","onlineDate":"02 May 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4907052,"authors":[{"name":"Oscar Gonzalez","affiliation":["Departamento de Ingenier\u00eda de Comunicaciones DICOM, Universidad de Cantabria, Cantabria, Spain"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8/5159551/4907052/4907052-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Oscar Gonz\u00e1lez was born in Santander, Spain, in 1978.

Beamforming and scene analysis for such arrays is typically done using sound field representation in terms of orthogonal basis functions (spherical/cylindrical harmonics). In this paper, an alternative sound field representation in terms of plane waves is described, and a method for estimating it directly from measurements at microphones is proposed. It is shown that representing a field as a collection of plane waves arriving from various directions simplifies source localization, beamforming, and spatial audio playback. A comparison of the new method with the well-known spherical harmonics based beamforming algorithm is done, and it is shown that both algorithms can be expressed in the same framework but with weights computed differently. It is also shown that the proposed method can be extended to cylindrical arrays. A number of features important for the design and operation of spherical microphone arrays in real applications are revealed. Results indicate that it is possible to reconstruct the sound scene up to order p with p2 microphones spherical array.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4907060/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 May 2009","volume":"18","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"10927049","publicationDate":"Jan. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4907060/","dateOfInsertion":"13 October 2009","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Plane-Wave Decomposition of Acoustical Scenes Via Spherical and Cylindrical Microphone Arrays","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Plane-Wave Decomposition of Acoustical Scenes Via Spherical and Cylindrical Microphone Arrays","sourcePdf":"17tasl06-dzotkin-2022000.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.077431S","chronDate":"Jan.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"10376","isNumber":"5286797","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10376","citationCount":"45","xplore-issue":"5286797","articleId":"4907060","onlineDate":"02 May 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4907065,"authors":[{"name":"Richard R.

Their combination of discrete states and stochastic transitions is suited to applications with deterministic and stochastic components. Hidden Markov models (HMMs) are a class of Markov models commonly used in pattern recognition. Currently, HMMs recognize patterns using a maximum-likelihood approach. One major drawback with this approach is that data observations are mapped to HMMs without considering the number of data samples available. Another problem is that this approach is only useful for choosing between HMMs. It does not provide a criterion for determining whether or not a given HMM adequately matches the data stream. In this paper, we recognize complex behaviors using HMMs and confidence intervals. The certainty of a data match increases with the number of data samples considered. Receiver operating characteristic curves are used to find the optimal threshold for either accepting or rejecting an HMM description. We present one example using a family of HMMs to show the utility of the proposed approach. A second example using models extracted from a database of consumer purchases provides additional evidence that this approach can perform better than existing techniques.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Behavior Detection Using Confidence Intervals of Hidden Markov Models","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)","doi":"10.1109/TSMCB.2009.2019732","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)","pdfPath":"/iel5/3477/5238715/04907065.pdf","startPage":"1484","endPage":"1492","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSMCB.2009.2019732","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5238715","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4907065","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4907065/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 May 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2009","displayDocTitle":"Behavior Detection Using Confidence Intervals of Hidden Markov Models","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"39","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/4907065/","dateOfInsertion":"22 September 2009","publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"10879850","pubMedId":"19414292","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Behavior Detection Using Confidence Intervals of Hidden Markov Models","sourcePdf":"tsmcb-brooks-2019732.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.11182S","chronDate":"Dec.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"3477","isNumber":"5238715","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3477","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"5238715","articleId":"4907065","onlineDate":"02 May 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4907073,"authors":[{"name":"Lihan He","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Duke University, Durham, NC, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/5200771/4907073/4907073-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Lihan He received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electrical engineering from Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, in 1999 and 2002, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical and computer engineering from Duke University, Durham, NC, in 2008.","He currently works as a Postdoctoral Associate with the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Duke University.

The center piece of this development is a reformulation of the well known extended recursive least squares (EX-RLS) algorithm in RKHS which only requires inner product operations between input vectors, thus enabling the application of the kernel property (commonly known as the kernel trick). The first part of the paper presents a set of theorems that shows the generality of the approach. The EX-KRLS is preferable to 1) a standard kernel recursive least squares (KRLS) in applications that require tracking the state-vector of general linear state-space models in the kernel space, or 2) an EX-RLS when the application requires a nonlinear observation and state models. The second part of the paper compares the EX-KRLS in nonlinear Rayleigh multipath channel tracking and in Lorenz system modeling problem. We show that the proposed algorithm is able to outperform the standard KRLS and EX-RLS in both simulations.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Extended Kernel Recursive Least Squares Algorithm","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2009.2022007","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/5238723/04907077.pdf","startPage":"3801","endPage":"3814","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2009.2022007","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5238723","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4907077","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4907077/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 May 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2009","displayDocTitle":"Extended Kernel Recursive Least Squares Algorithm","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"57","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/4907077/","dateOfInsertion":"15 September 2009","publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"10869462","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Extended Kernel Recursive Least Squares Algorithm","sourcePdf":"tsp-liu-2022007.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.07595S","chronDate":"Oct.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"5238723","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"149","xplore-issue":"5238723","articleId":"4907077","onlineDate":"02 May 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-28"},{"_id":4907078,"authors":[{"name":"Antonio G.

Users rely on adaptive modulation, coding and power modes that they select in accordance with the limited-rate feedback they receive from the access point. The access point uses CSI to maximize a generic concave utility of the average rates in the network while adhering to rate and power constraints imposed on the primary and secondary users to respect cognitive radio related hierarchies. When the channel distribution is available, optimum dual prices are found to optimally allocate resources across users dynamically per channel realization. In addition, a simple yet optimal online algorithm that does not require knowledge of the channel distribution and iteratively computes the dual prices per channel realization is developed using a stochastic dual approach. Analysis of the computational and feedback overhead along with simulations assessing the performance of the novel algorithms are also provided.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2009.2022009","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/5200771/04907078.pdf","startPage":"3651","endPage":"3666","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2009.2022009","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5200771","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamic Resource Management for Cognitive Radios Using Limited-Rate Feedback","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4907078","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 May 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4907078/","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic Resource Management for Cognitive Radios Using Limited-Rate Feedback","volume":"57","issue":"9","publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10816677","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4907078/","dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic Resource Management for Cognitive Radios Using Limited-Rate Feedback","sourcePdf":"57tsp09-ggiannakis-2022009.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.099491S","chronDate":"Sept.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"5200771","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"54","xplore-issue":"5200771","articleId":"4907078","onlineDate":"02 May 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4907080,"authors":[{"name":"Chia-Feng Juang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Chung Hsing University, Taichung, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/91/5272826/4907080/4907080-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Chia-Feng Juang (M\u201900\u2013SM\u201908) received the B.S. and Ph.D. degrees in control engineering from the National Chiao-Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan, in 1993 and 1997, respectively.","Since 2001, he has been with the Department of Electrical Engineering, National Chung-Hsing University (NCHU), Taichung, Taiwan, where he has been a Professor since 2007.

An RSEIT2FNN incorporates type-2 fuzzy sets in a recurrent neural fuzzy system in order to increase the noise resistance of a system. The antecedent parts in each recurrent fuzzy rule in the RSEIT2FNN are interval type-2 fuzzy sets, and the consequent part is of the Takagi-Sugeno-Kang (TSK) type with interval weights. The antecedent part of RSEIT2FNN forms a local internal feedback loop by feeding the rule firing strength of each rule back to itself. The TSK-type consequent part is a linear model of exogenous inputs. The RSEIT2FNN initially contains no rules; all rules are learned online via structure and parameter learning. The structure learning uses online type-2 fuzzy clustering. For the parameter learning, the consequent part parameters are tuned by a rule-ordered Kalman filter algorithm to improve learning performance. The antecedent type-2 fuzzy sets and internal feedback loop weights are learned by a gradient descent algorithm. The RSEIT2FNN is applied to simulations of dynamic system identifications and chaotic signal prediction under both noise-free and noisy conditions.

The proposed framework consists of a color saliency framework and an orientation saliency framework. The color saliency framework detects salient regions based on the spatial distribution of the component colors in the image space and their remoteness in the color space. The dominant hues in the image are used to initialize an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm to fit a Gaussian mixture model in the hue-saturation (H-S) space. The mixture of Gaussians framework in H-S space is used to compute the inter-cluster distance in the H-S domain as well as the relative spread among the corresponding colors in the spatial domain. Orientation saliency framework detects salient regions in images based on the global and local behavior of different orientations in the image. The oriented spectral information from the Fourier transform of the local patches in the image is used to obtain the local orientation histogram of the image. Salient regions are further detected by identifying spatially confined orientations and with the local patches that possess high orientation entropy contrast. The final saliency map is selected as either color saliency map or orientation saliency map by automatically identifying which of the maps leads to the correct identification of the salient region. The experiments are carried out on a large image database annotated with ldquoground-truthrdquo salient regions, provided by Microsoft Research Asia, which enables us to conduct robust objective level comparisons with other salient region detection algorithms.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Salient Region Detection by Modeling Distributions of Color and Orientation","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Multimedia","doi":"10.1109/TMM.2009.2021726","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Multimedia","pdfPath":"/iel5/6046/5166527/04907085.pdf","startPage":"892","endPage":"905","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMM.2009.2021726","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5166527","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4907085","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4907085/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 May 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2009","displayDocTitle":"Salient Region Detection by Modeling Distributions of Color and Orientation","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"11","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/4907085/","dateOfInsertion":"17 July 2009","publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","accessionNumber":"10780794","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Salient Region Detection by Modeling Distributions of Color and Orientation","sourcePdf":"11tmm05-drajan-2021726.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.144514S","chronDate":"Aug.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"6046","isNumber":"5166527","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6046","citationCount":"108","xplore-issue":"5166527","articleId":"4907085","onlineDate":"02 May 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4907087,"authors":[{"name":"Bo Zhao","affiliation":["School of Engineering, University of Warwick, Coventry, UK"],"firstName":"Bo","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37597339000"},{"name":"Yunfei Chen","affiliation":["School of Engineering, University of Warwick, Coventry, UK"],"firstName":"Yunfei","lastName":"Chen","id":"37281026600"},{"name":"Roger J.

Cochannel interference ultimately limits the quality of service offered to the users. At the moment, general capacity analysis for multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) correlated Rayleigh fading channels in the presence of correlated Rayleigh cochannel interference is not available in the literature, although its counterpart without cochannel interference has been thoroughly investigated. The difficulty arises from the quadratic form of the interference term. In this paper, based on the theory of matrix variate distribution, we investigate the capacity of MIMO Rayleigh fading channels with Rayleigh cochannel interference. We assume that perfect channel information is available to the receiver, but the transmitter has no channel information. We focus on the case when signals for the desired user and cochannel interferers are correlated at receiving antennas. We first derive an exact closed-form expression of the moment-generating function (MGF) of mutual information of MIMO channels with interference. Then, we further obtain an exact expression of the MIMO ergodic capacity with the MGF formula of mutual information. As a double check, these analytical results are validated by Monte Carlo simulations, and as an illustration of the mathematical formalism, numerical examples for particular cases of interest are plotted and discussed.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2009.2021840","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/5277109/04907090.pdf","startPage":"4398","endPage":"4405","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2009.2021840","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5277109","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Capacity of MIMO Rayleigh Fading Channels in the Presence of Interference and Receive Correlation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4907090","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 May 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4907090/","displayDocTitle":"Capacity of MIMO Rayleigh Fading Channels in the Presence of Interference and Receive Correlation","volume":"58","issue":"8","publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"10903059","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4907090/","dateOfInsertion":"02 October 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Capacity of MIMO Rayleigh Fading Channels in the Presence of Interference and Receive Correlation","sourcePdf":"tvt-wang-2021840.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.072901S","chronDate":"Oct.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"5277109","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"5277109","articleId":"4907090","onlineDate":"02 May 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4907091,"authors":[{"name":"Nan-Yang Yen","affiliation":["Department of Computer and Communication, National Pingtung Institute of Commerce, Ping Tung, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/5277109/4907091/4907091-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Nan-Yang Yen was born in Taiwan in 1967.

These standards are based on multiband orthogonal frequency-division-multiplexing (MB-OFDM) UWB or direct-sequence UWB (DS-UWB). However, because of the withdrawal of the plan for a unique standardization process by the IEEE 802.15.3a task group (TG3a), these two technologies will coexist in the future. In this context, this correspondence provides a performance analysis of DS-UWB communication in the presence of MB-OFDM interfering transmissions, where the channel is modeled through the IEEE 802.15.3a standard model, and the network topology for the MB-OFDM interferers is based on a clustered structure as per the IEEE 802.15.3 descriptions for medium access control (MAC) and physical layer specifications for high-rate WPANs. The DS-UWB system performance is assessed in terms of bit error rate (BER). Specifically, an analytical expression for the average BER is derived, conditioned on the channel impulse response using a pulse collision model. Numerical and simulation results are provided and compared for different coexistence scenarios.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2009.2021945","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/5277109/04907100.pdf","startPage":"4665","endPage":"4669","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2009.2021945","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5277109","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Effects of MB-OFDM System Interference on the Performance of DS-UWB","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4907100","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 May 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4907100/","displayDocTitle":"Effects of MB-OFDM System Interference on the Performance of DS-UWB","volume":"58","issue":"8","publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"10903060","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4907100/","dateOfInsertion":"02 October 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Effects of MB-OFDM System Interference on the Performance of DS-UWB","sourcePdf":"tvt-mehbodniya-2021945.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047073S","chronDate":"Oct.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"5277109","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"5277109","articleId":"4907100","onlineDate":"02 May 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4907101,"authors":[{"name":"Hiroshi Murakami","affiliation":["Earth Observation Research Center, Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency, Tsukuba, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/36/5332062/4907101/4907101-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Hiroshi Murakami received the B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. degrees in geophysics from Tohoku University, Sendai, Japan, in 1995, 1997, and 2002, respectively.","Since 1997, he has been working on the Advanced Earth Observing Satellite (ADEOS) Ocean Color and Temperature Scanner, ADEOS-2 Global Imager (GLI), and Global Change Observation Mission Second-generation GLI with the Earth Observation Research Center, National Space Development Agency (Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency since 2003), Tsukuba, Japan.

We proposed a new cross-calibration scheme which uses top-of-atmosphere reflectance functions of satellite zenith angle at temporally and spatially stable ground sites. Each function is made from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) 500-m resolution data over 16 days, which includes AVNIR-2 observation dates. The results showed that the radiances of AVNIR-2 bands 1 (463 nm), 2 (560 nm), and 3 (652 nm) agreed with the radiances of Aqua and Terra MODIS within 3% accuracy (standard deviation of 2%). AVNIR-2 band 4 (821 nm) had a difference of about 7% (AVNIR-2< MODIS) due to water-vapor absorption which could explain more than half of the 7%. Using many samples from this scheme, we found dependences of radiometric calibration errors within the field of view (FOV) and for different gain modes. The lamp calibration system onboard AVNIR-2 unveiled these dependences over the FOV and time. Furthermore, for the gain mode, consistent results could be retrieved using the cross-calibration scheme. The retrieved radiometric correction factors (over the FOV and gain modes) have been applied to the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency AVNIR-2 processing scheme. The subsequent validation of the correction showed, for polar snow areas, an improved radiometric performance over the entire FOV.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Calibration","Radiometry","Lamps","MODIS","Reflectivity","Satellite broadcasting","Spatial resolution","Image resolution","Electromagnetic wave absorption","Snow"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["calibration","geophysical equipment","radiometers","radiometry"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["AVNIR-2 radiometric calibration","cross calibration","onboard lamp calibration","Advanced Visible and Near Infrared Radiometer type 2","Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer","MODIS","water vapor absorption","gain mode","radiometric correction factor","Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency","time 16 day","wavelength 463 nm","wavelength 560 nm","wavelength 652 nm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Advanced Land Observation Satellite (ALOS)","Advanced Visible and Near Infrared Radiometer type 2 (AVNIR-2)","calibration","Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2009.2018118","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel5/36/5332062/04907101.pdf","startPage":"4051","endPage":"4059","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5332062","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2009.2018118","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improvement of AVNIR-2 Radiometric Calibration by Comparison of Cross-Calibration and Onboard Lamp Calibration","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4907101","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Improvement of AVNIR-2 Radiometric Calibration by Comparison of Cross-Calibration and Onboard Lamp Calibration","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4907101/","volume":"47","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4907101/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"10979213","dateOfInsertion":"17 November 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 May 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improvement of AVNIR-2 Radiometric Calibration by Comparison of Cross-Calibration and Onboard Lamp Calibration","sourcePdf":"tgrs-murakami-2018118.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.102422S","chronDate":"Dec.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"5332062","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"5332062","articleId":"4907101","onlineDate":"02 May 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4907106,"authors":[{"name":"Igor Maria De Rosa","affiliation":["Composite Materials Laboratory, Sapienza University of Rome, Rome, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/15/5208461/4907106/4907106-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Igor Maria De Rosa was born in Rome.

Results have been extended to 2.5D by assuming isotropic spreading in the third dimension. In both scenarios considered, reflections from surrounding buildings are found to increase the average received power on adjacent floors-up to 9.7 dB and 32 dB for buildings A and B respectively. Measurements of the impulse response in Building A, made with a sliding correlator channel sounder, show a number of long-delay pulses, which can be attributed to specific reflection paths. Based on these findings, a simple two-component propagation model to predict the sector-average signal strengths is proposed and validated against measurements of the received power. The direct component is modeled as free space with a 22 dB/floor attenuation factor, and the reflected component is modeled as free space with reflection/transmission coefficients of 0.5. The RMS prediction error for this model is 3.2 dB.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modeling the Effects of Nearby Buildings on Inter-Floor Radio-Wave Propagation","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2009.2021965","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8/5159551/04907126.pdf","startPage":"2155","endPage":"2161","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2009.2021965","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5159551","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4907126","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4907126/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 May 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2009","displayDocTitle":"Modeling the Effects of Nearby Buildings on Inter-Floor Radio-Wave Propagation","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"57","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/4907126/","dateOfInsertion":"07 July 2009","publicationDate":"July 2009","accessionNumber":"10774618","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modeling the Effects of Nearby Buildings on Inter-Floor Radio-Wave Propagation","sourcePdf":"57tap07-aaustin-2021965.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.070578S","chronDate":"July  2009","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"5159551","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"41","xplore-issue":"5159551","articleId":"4907126","onlineDate":"02 May 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4907127,"authors":[{"name":"RongLin Li","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA","Electronic and Information Engineering, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"RongLin","lastName":"Li","id":"37280237900"},{"name":"Terence Wu","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Terence","lastName":"Wu","id":"37401821000"},{"name":"Bo Pan","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Bo","lastName":"Pan","id":"37273108300"},{"name":"Kyutae Lim","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Kyutae","lastName":"Lim","id":"37280714900"},{"name":"Joy Laskar","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Joy","lastName":"Laskar","id":"37280282800"},{"name":"Manos M.

The feed point of conventional balun structures is fixed at the top of the integrated balun, which makes it difficult to match to a 50-Omega feed. In this communication, we demonstrate that it is possible to directly match with the 50-Omega feed by adjusting the position of the feed point of the integrated balun. The printed dipole with the hereby presented adjustable integrated balun maintains the broadband performance and exhibits flexibility for the matching to different impedance values, which is extremely important for the design of antenna arrays since the mutual coupling between antenna elements commonly changes the input impedance of each single element. An equivalent-circuit analysis is presented for the understanding of the mechanism of the impedance match.

With almost anyone can observe the communicated data all around, steganography attempts to hide the very existence of the message and make communication undetectable. Many techniques are used to secure information such as cryptography that aims to scramble the information sent and make it unreadable while steganography is used to conceal the information so that no one can sense its existence. In most algorithms used to secure information both steganography and cryptography are used together to secure a part of information. Steganography has many technical challenges such as high hiding capacity and imperceptibility. In this paper, we try to optimize these two main requirements by proposing a novel technique for hiding data in digital images by combining the use of adaptive hiding capacity function that hides secret data in the integer wavelet coefficients of the cover image with the optimum pixel adjustment (OPA) algorithm.

VLSI implementation of FleXilicon indicates that the proposed pipeline architecture can achieve a high speed operation up to 1 GHz using 65-nm SOI CMOS process with moderate silicon area. To estimate the performance of FleXilicon, we modeled the processor in SystemC and implemented five different types of applications commonly used in wireless communications and multimedia applications and compared its performance with an ARM processor and a TI digital signal processor. The simulation results indicate that FleXilicon reduces the number of clock cycles and increases the speed for all five applications.

More precisely, we simulated various vehicle circuits, ranging from ring oscillators to mirror full adders, to investigate the effectiveness of back biasing and transistor-stacking in both FinFETs and bulk MOSFETs. The opportunity to separate the gates of FinFETs and to operate them independently has been systematically analyzed; mixed connected- and independent-gate circuits have also been evaluated. The study spans over the device, the layout, and the circuit level of abstraction and appropriate figures of merit are introduced to quantify the potential advantage of different schemes. Our results show that, thanks to a larger threshold voltage sensitivity to back biasing, the FinFET technology is able to offer a more favorable compromise between standby power consumption and dynamic performance and is well suited for implementing fast and energy-efficient adaptive back-biasing strategies.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/92/5393244/04907217.pdf","startPage":"232","endPage":"245","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","doi":"10.1109/TVLSI.2008.2009633","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVLSI.2008.2009633","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5393244","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4907217","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Leakage\u2013Delay Tradeoff in FinFET Logic Circuits: A Comparative Analysis With Bulk Technology","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["FinFETs","Logic circuits","Circuit analysis","MOSFETs","FETs","Circuit simulation","Vehicles","Ring oscillators","Mirrors","Adders"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adders","CMOS logic circuits","delays","low-power electronics","MOSFET circuits","oscillators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multi-gate fin FETs","FinFET logic circuits","transistor-stacking","ring oscillators","vehicle circuits","mirror full adders","figures of merit","threshold voltage sensitivity","standby power consumption","energy-efficient adaptive back-biasing strategies","low standby power circuit techniques","bulk MOSFETs","CMOS technology","leakage delay"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Back biasing","double-gate MOSFETs","fin FETs (FinFETs)","independent gates","leakage reduction","Stack effect"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4907217/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 May 2009","displayDocTitle":"Leakage\u2013Delay Tradeoff in FinFET Logic Circuits: A Comparative Analysis With Bulk Technology","volume":"18","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/4907217/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2010","accessionNumber":"11071364","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Leakage\u2013Delay Tradeoff in FinFET Logic Circuits: A Comparative Analysis With Bulk Technology","sourcePdf":"tvlsi-malioto-2009633.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.107489S","chronDate":"Feb.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"5393244","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"57","xplore-issue":"5393244","articleId":"4907217","onlineDate":"02 May 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4907224,"authors":[{"name":"Donghyun Choi","affiliation":["Information Security Group, SungKyunKwan University, Gyeonggi, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/61/5109837/4907224/4907224-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Donghyun Choi (S'08) received the B.E. degree in electrical and computer engineering and the M.S. degree in computer science from the Information Security Group, Sungkyunkwan University, Gyeonggi-do, Korea, in 2005 and 2007, respectively, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree in mobile systems engineering.","His current research interest is in the area of cryptography, supervisory control and data acquisition, mobile security, and digital rights management (DRM)."]},"firstName":"Donghyun","lastName":"Choi","id":"37634042600"},{"name":"Hakman Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Incheon City College, Incheon, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/61/5109837/4907224/4907224-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Hakman Kim received the B.E., M.E., and Ph.D. degrees from Sungkyunkwan University, Gyeonggi-do, Korea, in 1991, 1993, and 1998, respectively.","He was with the Korea Electrotechnology Research Institute from 1996 to 2008.

In the past, SCADA systems were designed without security functionality because of the closed operating environment. However, the security of SCADA systems has become an issue with connection to open networks becoming more common. Any damage to the SCADA system can have a widespread negative effect to society. In this paper, we review constraints and security requirements for SCADA systems and then investigate whether the existing key-management protocols for the SCADA systems satisfy these requirements. Afterward, we propose an advanced key-management architecture fitted for secure SCADA communications. The contributions of our work are two-fold. First, our scheme supports both message broadcasting and secure communication. Second, by evenly spreading much of the total amount of computation across high power nodes (MTU or SUB-MTU), our protocol avoids any potential performance bottleneck of the system while keeping the burden on low power nodes (RTU) at minimal.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","pdfPath":"/iel5/61/5109837/04907224.pdf","startPage":"1154","endPage":"1163","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","doi":"10.1109/TPWRD.2008.2005683","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRD.2008.2005683","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5109837","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4907224","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Advanced Key-Management Architecture for Secure SCADA Communications","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["SCADA systems","Communication system security","Data security","National security","Protocols","Communication system control","Control systems","Computer architecture","Broadcasting","High performance computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power system security","SCADA systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["advanced key-management architecture","secure SCADA communications","supervisory control and data-acquisition systems","key-management protocols","power system security"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Key management","power system security","supervisory control and data-acquisition (SCADA) systems"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4907224/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 May 2009","displayDocTitle":"Advanced Key-Management Architecture for Secure SCADA Communications","volume":"24","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/4907224/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2009","accessionNumber":"10731616","dateOfInsertion":"23 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Advanced Key-Management Architecture for Secure SCADA Communications","sourcePdf":"tpwrd-skim-2005683.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.083867S","chronDate":"July  2009","xplore-pub-id":"61","isNumber":"5109837","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"61","citationCount":"59","xplore-issue":"5109837","articleId":"4907224","onlineDate":"02 May 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4907232,"authors":[{"name":"Prathap Nair","affiliation":["Multimedia and Vision Group, Queen Mary, University of London, London, UK"],"firstName":"Prathap","lastName":"Nair","id":"37645215100"},{"name":"Andrea Cavallaro","affiliation":["Multimedia and Vision Group, Queen Mary, University of London, London, UK"],"firstName":"Andrea","lastName":"Cavallaro","id":"37273747900"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-9210"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0077"}],"articleNumber":"4907232","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":96,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":1814},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/organizations/society/sp/index.html"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits &amp; Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Face detection","Robustness","Shape","Information retrieval","Face recognition","Curve fitting","Data mining","Databases","Noise shaping","Phase noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["face recognition","image registration","image segmentation","iterative methods","object detection","visual databases"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3D face detection","landmark localization","point distribution model","face segmentation","face registration","low-level curvature-based feature maps","prior anthropometric knowledge","iterative closest point method","face retrieval","face recognition","GavabDB dataset"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Face detection","face meshes","landmark localization","registration","shape model"]}],"abstract":"We present an accurate and robust framework for detecting and segmenting faces, localizing landmarks, and achieving fine registration of face meshes based on the fitting of a facial model. This model is based on a 3-D Point Distribution Model (PDM) that is fitted without relying on texture, pose, or orientation information. Fitting is initialized using candidate locations on the mesh, which are extracted from low-level curvature-based feature maps. Face detection is performed by classifying the transformations between model points and candidate vertices based on the upper-bound of the deviation of the parameters from the mean model. Landmark localization is performed on the segmented face by finding the transformation that minimizes the deviation of the model from the mean shape. Face registration is obtained using prior anthropometric knowledge and the localized landmarks. The performance of face detection is evaluated on a database of faces and non-face objects where we achieve an accuracy of 99.6%. We also demonstrate face detection and segmentation on objects with different scale and pose. The robustness of landmark localization is evaluated with noisy data and by varying the number of shapes and model points used in the model learning phase. Finally, face registration is compared with the traditional Iterative Closest Point (ICP) method and evaluated through a face retrieval and recognition framework on the GavabDB dataset, where we achieve a recognition rate of 87.4% and a retrieval rate of 83.9%.","doi":"10.1109/TMM.2009.2017629","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Multimedia","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Multimedia","pdfPath":"/iel5/6046/4939467/04907232.pdf","startPage":"611","endPage":"623","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMM.2009.2017629","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4939467","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"3-D Face Detection, Landmark Localization, and Registration Using a Point Distribution Model","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4907232","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 May 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4907232/","displayDocTitle":"3-D Face Detection, Landmark Localization, and Registration Using a Point Distribution Model","volume":"11","issue":"4","publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10664205","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"3-D Face Detection, Landmark Localization, and Registration Using a Point Distribution Model","sourcePdf":"11tmm04-pnair-2017629.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.056445S","chronDate":"June  2009","isNumber":"4939467","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6046","citationCount":"96","articleId":"4907232","onlineDate":"02 May 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4907234,"authors":[{"name":"Hao Qi","affiliation":["System and Technology Group, IBM, Shanghai, China","High Frequency Engineering Centre, Cardiff University, Cardiff, UK"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/5071758/4907234/4907234-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Hao Qi (S'05\u2013M'07) received the B.Eng degree in electronic engineering from Beihang University, Beijing, China, in 2003, the M.S. degree in electronic engineering from Bristol University, Bristol, U.K., in 2004, and the Ph.D. degree in microwave engineering from Cardiff University, Cardiff, U.K., in 2008.","He is currently with the System and Technology Group, IBM, Shanghai, China, where he is involved with the development of wafer test systems for RF and mixed-signal products."]},"firstName":"Hao","lastName":"Qi","id":"37553790700"},{"name":"Johannes Benedikt","affiliation":["Frequency Engineering Centre, Cardiff University, Cardiff, UK"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/5071758/4907234/4907234-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Johannes Benedikt received the Dipl.-Ing. degree in electrical engineering from the University of Ulm, Ulm, Germany, in 1997, and the Ph.D. degree from Cardiff University, Cardiff, U.K., in 2002.","In October 2000, he became a Senior Research Associate with Cardiff University, during which time he supervised a research program on RF power amplifiers with Nokia.

The major contributor to the third-order nonlinearity in the CG amplifier is the second derivative of the transconductor (\n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">g</i>\n \n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">m</sub>\n \n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">''</sup>\n), which is the same case with a common-source (CS) amplifier. The multiple gated transistor (MGTR) technique, which was developed in the CS amplifier for transconductor nonlinearity cancellation, is applied to a CG amplifier. However, in the CG amplifier, the input driving impedance of a CG amplifier comprises a voltage-current feedback loop. Thus, a second-order interaction with feedback components generates a third-order distortion that limits input-referred third-order intercept point (IIP3) enhancement. This feedback influence on IIP3 can be relaxed by eliminating harmonic feedback components. Based on high-frequency analysis on a CG amplifier using the Volterra series, an RF current source is proposed to replace the conventional current source in the CG amplifier to eliminate harmonic feedback components at 2omega and Deltaomega. By adapting the CG MGTR technique combined with the RF current source, a 2.4-GHz driver amplifier for Wibro/Wimax applications was implemented using a 0.18-mum 1P 6M CMOS process. Measurement results show a 9-dB output third-order intercept point improvement at an output power of -3 dBm.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4907243/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 May 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2009","volume":"57","issue":"6","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10728478","dateOfInsertion":"10 June 2009","publicationDate":"June 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4907243/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A Common-Gate Amplifier With Transconductance Nonlinearity Cancellation and Its High-Frequency Analysis Using the Volterra Series","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Common-Gate Amplifier With Transconductance Nonlinearity Cancellation and Its High-Frequency Analysis Using the Volterra Series","sourcePdf":"tmtt-kim-2019998.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.141892S","chronDate":"June  2009","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"5071758","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"64","xplore-issue":"5071758","articleId":"4907243","onlineDate":"02 May 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4907246,"authors":[{"name":"Nenad Smolic-Rocak","affiliation":["Visor d. o. o., Zagreb, Croatia"],"firstName":"Nenad","lastName":"Smolic-Rocak","id":"38276193100"},{"name":"Stjepan Bogdan","affiliation":["Department of Control and Computer Engineering in Automation, Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computing, University of Zagreb, Zagreb, Croatia"],"firstName":"Stjepan","lastName":"Bogdan","id":"37357209200"},{"name":"Zdenko Kovacic","affiliation":["Department of Control and Computer Engineering in Automation, Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computing, University of Zagreb, Zagreb, Croatia"],"firstName":"Zdenko","lastName":"Kovacic","id":"37354273800"},{"name":"Tamara Petrovic","affiliation":["Department of Control and Computer Engineering in Automation, Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computing, University of Zagreb, Zagreb, Croatia"],"firstName":"Tamara","lastName":"Petrovic","id":"37638556300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1545-5955"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-3783"}],"articleNumber":"4907246","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":84,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":3137},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Robotics and Automation Society","url":"http://www.ieee-ras.org"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4907246","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Routing","Vehicle dynamics","Supervisory control","Vehicles","Shortest path problem","Performance evaluation","Testing","Scheduling algorithm","Job shop scheduling","Electrical equipment industry"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automatic guided vehicles","integrated software","path planning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["time windows based dynamic routing","multi AGV systems","supervisory control","automated guided vehicles","shortest path problem","vector form","predefined candidate paths","windows overlapping tests","industrial environment"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Automated guided vehicles","dynamic routing","path feasibility","time windows"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TASE.2009.2016350","endPage":"155","startPage":"151","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/8856/5361440/04907246.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TASE.2009.2016350","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5361440","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Time Windows Based Dynamic Routing in Multi-AGV Systems","abstract":"This paper presents a dynamic routing method for supervisory control of multiple automated guided vehicles (AGVs) that are traveling within a layout of a given warehouse. In dynamic routing a calculated path particularly depends on the number of currently active AGVs' missions and their priorities. In order to solve the shortest path problem dynamically, the proposed routing method uses time windows in a vector form. For each mission requested by the supervisor, predefined candidate paths are checked if they are feasible. The feasibility of a particular path is evaluated by insertion of appropriate time windows and by performing the windows overlapping tests. The use of time windows makes the algorithm apt for other scheduling and routing problems. Presented simulation results demonstrate efficiency of the proposed dynamic routing. The proposed method has been successfully implemented in the industrial environment in a form of a multiple AGV control system.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 May 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4907246/","volume":"7","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/4907246/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11024413","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"28 December 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Time Windows Based Dynamic Routing in Multi-AGV Systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Time Windows Based Dynamic Routing in Multi-AGV Systems","sourcePdf":"tase-bogdan-2016350.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.079215S","chronDate":"Jan.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"8856","isNumber":"5361440","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8856","citationCount":"84","xplore-issue":"5361440","articleId":"4907246","onlineDate":"02 May 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":4907301,"authors":[{"name":"Frederik W.

A DSP-based experimental PMSM-driven reaction wheel system is established, and the key motor parameters are estimated for realizing the proposed control schemes. In the proposed current control schemes, the traditional 2-DOF controller is augmented with an internal model feedback resonant controller or a robust tracking error cancellation controller (RECC). Comparative performance and error analyses of these two proposed control schemes are given. Accordingly, an improved robust 2-DOF current control scheme combining the resonant controller and the RECC is further proposed. The resonant controller enhances the transient and steady-state tracking of the sinusoidal current, simultaneously rejecting the back electromotive force. A similar robust tracking control for the observed torque can be designed, which exhibits quick transient response. Effectiveness of the proposed controls and the driving performance of the whole reaction wheel are evaluated experimentally.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/63/4815917/04907303.pdf","startPage":"1304","endPage":"1320","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2009.2012713","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2009.2012713","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4815917","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4907303","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Development of Robust Current 2-DOF Controllers for a Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motor Drive With Reaction Wheel Load","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robust control","Permanent magnet motors","Wheels","Resonance","Torque control","Current control","Satellites","Synchronous motors","Parameter estimation","Control systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electric current control","electric potential","feedback","machine control","permanent magnet motors","robust control","synchronous motor drives","torque control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["robust current 2-DOF controllers","permanent magnet synchronous motor drive","reaction wheel load","torque control","satellite reaction wheel load","DSP","PMSM-driven reaction wheel system","internal model feedback resonant controller","robust tracking error cancellation controller","back electromotive force","transient response"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Current control","feedforward control","internal model control","permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM)","resonant controller","robust control","torque control"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4907303/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 May 2009","displayDocTitle":"Development of Robust Current 2-DOF Controllers for a Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motor Drive With Reaction Wheel Load","volume":"24","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/4907303/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10658460","dateOfInsertion":"02 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Development of Robust Current 2-DOF Controllers for a Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motor Drive With Reaction Wheel Load","sourcePdf":"tpel-liaw-2012713.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.087413S","chronDate":"May  2009","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"4815917","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"33","xplore-issue":"4815917","articleId":"4907303","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4907304,"authors":[{"name":"Dianbo Fu","affiliation":["Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Blacksburg, VA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/4815917/4907304/4907304-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Dianbo Fu received the B.S. degree from Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China, in 2001, and the M.S. degree in 2004 from Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University (Virginia Tech), Blacksburg, where he is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree.","His current research interests include high-frequency power conversion, distributed power system, soft switching techniques, and low-voltage high-current conversion techniques.

It is very suitable for high-frequency, high-efficiency, and high-power-density dc-dc resonant converters with SRs. In this paper, an LLC resonant converter with the proposed synchronous rectification is designed and analyzed. With the proposed driving scheme, the SR body diode conduction is reduced to almost zero. The driving scheme eliminates the reverse-recovery problem of SRs. Both current and voltage stresses are greatly decreased, and the conduction loss and switching loss of SRs are also reduced considerably. The experimental results show that the proposed LLC resonant converter with SRs can achieve low stress, high efficiency, and high power density.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Novel Driving Scheme for Synchronous Rectifiers in <emphasis emphasistype=\"italic\">LLC</emphasis> Resonant Converters","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2009.2012500","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/63/4815917/04907304.pdf","startPage":"1321","endPage":"1329","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2009.2012500","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4815917","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4907304","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4907304/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 May 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2009","displayDocTitle":"A Novel Driving Scheme for Synchronous Rectifiers in <emphasis emphasistype=\"italic\">LLC</emphasis> Resonant Converters","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"24","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/4907304/","dateOfInsertion":"02 May 2009","publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10658462","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel Driving Scheme for Synchronous Rectifiers in <emphasis emphasistype=\"italic\">LLC</emphasis> Resonant Converters","sourcePdf":"tpel-fu-2012500.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.094507S","chronDate":"May  2009","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"4815917","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"228","xplore-issue":"4815917","articleId":"4907304","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":4907312,"authors":[{"name":"Ajit Sharma","affiliation":["Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA","Texas Instruments, Inc., Dallas, TX, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/4907307/4907312/4907312-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ajit Sharma (S'01\u2013M'08) received the B.E.

Under noisy environments, the output clock of 1 GHz has 4.58 ps RMS and 29 ps peak-to-peak jitter.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Jitter","Random access memory","Clocks","Delay lines","Working environment noise","Bandwidth","Phase noise","Noise reduction","Monitoring","Frequency synchronization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["clocks","CMOS integrated circuits","delay lock loops","DRAM chips","jitter"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["jitter reduction techniques","quadrature phase generation","DRAM interfaces","loop response mode","phase error tracking","narrow effective loop","CMOS process","output clock","peak-to-peak jitter","delay-locked loop","size 0.13 micron","frequency 1 GHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["CMOS","delay-locked loop (DLL)","DRAM interface","jitter"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4907314","doi":"10.1109/JSSC.2009.2016993","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel5/4/4907307/04907314.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSSC.2009.2016993","startPage":"1522","endPage":"1530","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4907307","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A DLL With Jitter Reduction Techniques and Quadrature Phase Generation for DRAM Interfaces","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A DLL With Jitter Reduction Techniques and Quadrature Phase Generation for DRAM Interfaces","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4907314/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 May 2009","volume":"44","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/4907314/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"02 May 2009","publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10627465","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A DLL With Jitter Reduction Techniques and Quadrature Phase Generation for DRAM Interfaces","sourcePdf":"jssc-kim-2016993.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.146929S","chronDate":"May  2009","xplore-pub-id":"4","isNumber":"4907307","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"4907307","articleId":"4907314","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4907315,"authors":[{"name":"Byeong-Gyu Nam","affiliation":["Processor Architecture Laboratory, SOC Platform Team, Samsung Electronics Company Limited, Yongin si, Gyeonggi, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/4907307/4907315/4907315-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Byeong-Gyu Nam (M'07) received the B.S. degree (summa cum laude) in computer engineering from Kyungbook National University, Daegu, Korea, in 1999, and M.S. degree in computer science from Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), Daejeon, Korea, in 2001.

Of particular interest are hostile environment scenarios where radiation and thermal extremes exist. Radiation hardening by design has been recognized for over a decade as an alternative open-source circuit design approach to mitigate a spectrum of radiation effects, but has significant power and area penalties. Similarly, asynchronous logic design offers potential power savings and performance improvements, with a tradeoff in design complexity and a lesser area penalty.

The circuit, based on an integrator followed by a differentiator configuration, features i) a low-noise time-continuous feedback loop to cope with possible standing currents from the device under test as high as few tens of nA without limiting the signal dynamic range; ii) active current-reducers to implement very high value equivalent resistances of hundreds of GOmega with high linearity irrespective to the current direction and characterized by a shot noise current level (2\n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">qI</i>\n) which is, for low standing current, few orders of magnitude smaller than a physical resistor of equal value and iii) nested-Miller compensation networks to ensure strong stability over a bandwidth of few MHz. Thanks to the ability to draw large standing currents, the circuit is suitable for a use in biological systems where physiological medium is co-present. The measured input equivalent noise of 4 fA/radic(Hz) at about 100 kHz, recorded when the input dc current is lower than 10 pA, allows the chip to be used, among others, in impedance spectroscopy measurements at the nanoscale with a capability of detecting capacitance variations in sub-attofarad range to cope with the challenges of single-chip instrumentation.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel5/4/4907307/04907328.pdf","startPage":"1609","endPage":"1616","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","doi":"10.1109/JSSC.2009.2016998","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSSC.2009.2016998","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4907307","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4907328","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Transimpedance Amplifier for High Sensitivity Current Measurements on Nanodevices","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Current measurement","Nanobioscience","CMOS technology","Circuit testing","Capacitance measurement","Impedance measurement","Noise measurement","Semiconductor device measurement","Paper technology","Feedback circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplifiers","capacitance","CMOS integrated circuits","electric impedance","electric resistance","resistors","shot noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS technology","sensing current signals","integrator","differentiator configuration","low-noise time-continuous feedback loop","current-reducers","equivalent resistances","shot noise current level","resistor","nested-Miller compensation networks","input dc current","impedance spectroscopy","capacitance","single-chip instrumentation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Active resistor","high sensitivity instrumentation","instrument-on-chip","transimpedance amplifier"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4907328/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 May 2009","displayDocTitle":"Transimpedance Amplifier for High Sensitivity Current Measurements on Nanodevices","volume":"44","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/4907328/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10615904","dateOfInsertion":"02 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Transimpedance Amplifier for High Sensitivity Current Measurements on Nanodevices","sourcePdf":"jssc-ferrari-2016998.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.06572S","chronDate":"May  2009","xplore-pub-id":"4","isNumber":"4907307","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"104","xplore-issue":"4907307","articleId":"4907328","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4907329,"authors":[{"name":"Hsin-Hsing Liao","affiliation":["Broadcom Corporation, San Diego, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/4907307/4907329/4907329-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Hsin-Hsing Liao (M'08) received the B.S.E.E. degree from National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan, in 1989, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from the University of California at San Diego in 1997.","From 1997 to 1999, he worked for TRW, Redondo Beach, CA, as a Senior Member of Technical Staff developing MMICs using III-V HBT or pHEMT technologies.

Since mobile devices have limited CPU power, dedicated hardware is essential to provide sufficient virus detection performance. A TCAM-based virus-detection unit provides high throughput, but also challenges for low power and low cost. In this paper, an adaptively dividable dual-port BiTCAM (unifying binary and ternary CAMs) is proposed to achieve a high-throughput, low-power, and low-cost virus-detection processor for mobile devices. The proposed dual-port BiTCAM is realized with the dual-port AND-type match-line scheme which is composed of dual-port dynamic AND gates. The dual-port designs reduce power consumption and increase storage efficiency due to shared storage spaces.

Power consumption can be further reduced down to about 30 muW by operating the sensor in Idle-Mode, thus minimizing the sensor activity at the ouput.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4907307","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel5/4/4907307/04907337.pdf","doi":"10.1109/JSSC.2009.2017000","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSSC.2009.2017000","startPage":"1582","endPage":"1592","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 100 -W 128 - 64 Pixels Contrast-Based Asynchronous Binary Vision Sensor for Sensor Networks Applications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 May 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4907337/","displayDocTitle":"A 100 <formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex Notation=\"TeX\">$\\mu$</tex> </formula>W 128 <formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex Notation=\"TeX\">$\\times$</tex> </formula> 64 Pixels Contrast-Based Asynchronous Binary Vision Sensor for Sensor Networks Applications","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4907337/","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"44","issue":"5","accessionNumber":"10627477","dateOfInsertion":"02 May 2009","publicationDate":"May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 100 <formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex Notation=\"TeX\">$\\mu$</tex> </formula>W 128 <formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex Notation=\"TeX\">$\\times$</tex> </formula> 64 Pixels Contrast-Based Asynchronous Binary Vision Sensor for Sensor Networks Applications","sourcePdf":"jssc-gottardi-2017000.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.065118S","chronDate":"May  2009","xplore-pub-id":"4","isNumber":"4907307","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"59","xplore-issue":"4907307","articleId":"4907337","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4907338,"authors":[{"name":"Oren Eytan Eliezer","affiliation":["Texas Instruments, Inc., Dallas, TX, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/4907307/4907338/4907338-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Oren Eytan Eliezer (M'98) received the B.S.E.E. and M.S.E.E. degrees with honors from the Tel-Aviv University, Israel, in 1988 and 1997, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree from the University of Texas at Dallas in 2008.","From 1988 to 1994, he was with the Israeli military, developing wireless communication systems in various frequency bands.

Several examples of possible applications of this approach in a wireless cellular transceiver system-on-chip (SoC) are listed, and the application of one example is presented in detail. Mathematical analysis, simulation results, measurements, and implementation details are provided for the demonstrated technique, which was designed to minimize jitter induced onto the reference clock of a GSM transceiver's PLL. Excessive jitter on this clock, caused by multiple RF aggressors centered at harmonics of it, creates amplified in-band phase-noise at the RF output of the PLL, resulting in failures in the transmitter's performance. The identification of this highly complex interference mechanism, which represents a significant part of this work, is discussed in detail, as is the implemented solution. The presented phase-adjustment technique, leveraging specific features of the digitally intensive PLL and available digital-signal-processing resources, is demonstrated in a GSM system-on-chip (SoC) based on the Digital RF Processor (DRPtrade) technology in 90 nm CMOS. As it does not involve dedicated hardware, nor does it noticeably increase the current consumption, it represents a cost-free solution in the final product.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Transceivers","Phase locked loops","Radio frequency","System-on-a-chip","Jitter","Clocks","GSM","Mathematical analysis","Analytical models","Radiofrequency identification"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","clocks","CMOS integrated circuits","jitter","phase locked loops","phase noise","system-on-chip","transceivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["self-interference","wireless cellular transceiver system-on-chip","jitter","reference clock","GSM","PLL","multiple RF aggressors","transmitter","phase-adjustment technique","digital RF processor","CMOS process","in-band phase noise","size 90 nm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["All-digital PLL (ADPLL)","Digital RF Processor (DRP)","interference mitigation","jitter","phase trajectory error (PTE)","self-interference","system-on-chip (SoC)"]}],"doi":"10.1109/JSSC.2009.2014941","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel5/4/4907307/04907338.pdf","startPage":"1436","endPage":"1453","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4907307","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSSC.2009.2014941","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Phase Domain Approach for Mitigation of Self-Interference in Wireless Transceivers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4907338","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Phase Domain Approach for Mitigation of Self-Interference in Wireless Transceivers","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4907338/","volume":"44","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4907338/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"10615910","dateOfInsertion":"02 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 May 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Phase Domain Approach for Mitigation of Self-Interference in Wireless Transceivers","sourcePdf":"44jssc05-oeliezer-2014941.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.143004S","chronDate":"May  2009","xplore-pub-id":"4","isNumber":"4907307","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"4907307","articleId":"4907338","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-09"},{"_id":4907340,"authors":[{"name":"Ta-chien D.

Emphasis will also be placed on the use of these methods to improve performance in, and understanding of, the dynamics of games, as well as gaining insight into the properties of the methods as applied to games. It will also include using games as a platform for building intelligent embedded agents for real-world applications. The journal builds on a scientific community that has already been active in recent years with the development of new conference series such as the IEEE Symposium on Computational Intelligence in Games (CIG) and Artificial Intelligence and Interactive Digital Entertainment (AIIDE), as well as special issues on games in journals such as the IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation. When setting up the journal, a decision was made to include both artificial intelligence (AI) and computational intelligence (CI) in the title. AI seeks to simulate intelligent behavior in any way that can be programmed effectively.

In our proposed implementation, the WL receiver first separates the in-phase (I) and quadrature (Q) parts of the complex-valued baseband received signal and jointly filters the two branches for signal detection. Infinite length WL minimum mean-square error (WL-MMSE) linear, and WL decision-feedback-equalizer (WL-DFE) settings are derived and performance is analyzed in co-channel interference limited channels. It is shown that, in frequency selective Rayleigh fading channels, the interference cancellation (IC) gain depends mainly on the rank (r) of the interference correlation matrix (ICM) which is defined as the covariance of the vector-valued signal which consists of the real and imaginary parts of the noise-plus-interference signal collected at multiple antenna branches. Assuming that the DFE feedback path is error free, we show that a WL QAM receiver with N antennas exhibits full IC capability (that is complete interference removal) when the ICM is rank deficient i.e., when: r < 2N. This condition implies that a WL-DFE receiver can reject any combination of M\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sub>\n pulse-amplitude-modulation (PAM) and M\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sub>\n QAM interferers satisfying the constraint: M\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sub>\n + 2M\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sub>\n < 2N. Simulation results show that, in the presence of PAM-type interference, the gain of WL-DFE is reduced by decision feedback errors while the IC benefit of WL-MMSE is limited by the noise enhancement problem. Nevertheless, the proposed receivers are shown to be useful in cellular systems that employ a combination of PAM and QAM schemes.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/4907423/04907425.pdf","startPage":"1585","endPage":"1590","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2009.060174","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2009.060174","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4907423","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4907425","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Interference cancellation enhancement through generalized widely linear equalization in QAM systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference cancellation","Quadrature amplitude modulation","Integrated circuit noise","Feedback","Equalizers","Baseband","Filters","Signal detection","Performance analysis","Interchannel interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","cellular radio","correlation methods","covariance matrices","decision feedback equalisers","filtering theory","interference suppression","least mean squares methods","pulse amplitude modulation","quadrature amplitude modulation","radio receivers","Rayleigh channels","signal detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["interference cancellation enhancement","generalized widely linear receiver equalization","QAM system","quadrature amplitude modulation","multiple antenna","signal detection","minimum mean-square error","decision-feedback-equalizer","co-channel interference","selective Rayleigh fading channel","interference correlation matrix","covariance matrix","vector-valued signal","noise-plus-interference signal","pulse-amplitude-modulation","filter theory","cellular system"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Widely linear filtering","minimum mean-square estimation","diversity","interference suppression","decision feedback equalization","linear equalization"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4907425/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 May 2009","displayDocTitle":"Interference cancellation enhancement through generalized widely linear equalization in QAM systems","volume":"8","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/4907425/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10627512","dateOfInsertion":"02 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Interference cancellation enhancement through generalized widely linear equalization in QAM systems","sourcePdf":"1585-tw0904-kuchi.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.086634S","chronDate":"April  2009","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"4907423","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4907423","articleId":"4907425","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":4907427,"authors":[{"name":"Lorenzo Mucchi","affiliation":["CNIT-Department of Electronics and Telecommunications, University of Florence, Italy"],"firstName":"Lorenzo","lastName":"Mucchi","id":"37270218400"},{"name":"Patrizio Marcocci","affiliation":["CNIT-Department of Electronics and Telecommunications, University of Florence, Italy"],"firstName":"Patrizio","lastName":"Marcocci","id":"37644292100"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1536-1276"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2248"}],"articleNumber":"4907427","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":29,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":443},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/organizations/society/sp/index.html#pub"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Signal processing","Delay estimation","Multipath channels","Time of arrival estimation","Indoor environments","Wireless communication","Delay effects","Amplitude estimation","Fingers","Fading"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["indoor radio","personal area networks","ultra wideband communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["UWB indoor channel profile identification","ultra wideband indoor environments","line-of-sight conditions","nonline-of-sight conditions","signal-to-noise-ratio","kurtosis index","IEEE802.15.3"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Channel identification","environment identification","UWB","kurtosis"]}],"abstract":"This paper proposes a new parameter for identifying the room typology when the receiver is in ultra wideband (UWB) indoor environments. The method proposed does not imply any estimation process at the received signal. The proposed parameter is not only able to clearly distinguish between line-of-sight (LOS) and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) conditions, but it is also capable of ordering the quality of the received signal in two different LOS or NLOS rooms, although the signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) is the same. Moreover, this parameter is able to distinguish between LOS and NLOS macro groups clearly and, at the same time, to order conditions within these two macro groups (for example, clear LOS condition from Quasi-LOS, i.e., when an object partially shadows the link, etc.). The method proposed in this paper is based on the calculation of the kurtosis index of the sampled received signal. The kurtosis index can be successfully applied to the received signal in order to identify the typology of the link between transmitter and receiver (LOS, Quasi-LOS, high-NLOS, low-NLOS, extreme-low-NLOS). Results are achieved by both real measurements and simulations with IEEE802.15.3a and 4a channel models.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2009.070318","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/4907423/04907427.pdf","startPage":"1597","endPage":"1602","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2009.070318","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4907423","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new parameter for UWB indoor channel profile identification","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4907427","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 May 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4907427/","displayDocTitle":"A new parameter for UWB indoor channel profile identification","volume":"8","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10627519","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4907427/","dateOfInsertion":"02 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new parameter for UWB indoor channel profile identification","sourcePdf":"1597-tw0904-mucchi.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.061433S","chronDate":"April  2009","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"4907423","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"4907423","articleId":"4907427","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4907428,"authors":[{"name":"Xiangming Li","affiliation":["School of Information and Electronics Engineering, Beijing Institute of Technology, China"],"firstName":"Xiangming","lastName":"Li","id":"37280863500"},{"name":"Hsiao-Hwa Chen","affiliation":["Department of Engineering Science, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Hsiao-Hwa","lastName":"Chen","id":"37281172400"},{"name":"Yi Qian","affiliation":["National Institute for Standards and Technology, Gaithersburg, MD, USA"],"firstName":"Yi","lastName":"Qian","id":"37276182400"},{"name":"Bo Rong","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Ecole de Technologie Superieure, Universite du Quebec, Montreal, Canada"],"firstName":"Bo","lastName":"Rong","id":"37284111200"},{"name":"Mohammad Reza Soleymani","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Concordia University, Canada"],"firstName":"Mohammad Reza","lastName":"Soleymani","id":"37285147900"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1536-1276"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2248"}],"articleNumber":"4907428","dbTime":"25 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":246},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/organizations/society/sp/index.html#pub"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiaccess communication","Multiple access interference","Upper bound","Autocorrelation","Intersymbol interference","Wireless communication","Multipath channels","Interference suppression","Interference constraints","Delay systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel coding","code division multiple access","intersymbol interference","multipath channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Welch bound analysis","generic code division multiple access","CDMA","interference free window","wireless communication system","multiple access interference","inter symbol interference","multipath channel","generalized spreading code"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Multiple access","CDMA","Welch bound","complementary sequences","interference free window"]}],"abstract":"Code-division multiple access (CDMA) technology has been applied to many wireless communication systems.

Many existing OFDM designs successfully exploit the multipath diversity offered by frequency-selective channels. However, most of them require maximum likelihood (ML) or near-ML detection at the receiver, which is of high complexity. On the other hand, empirical results have shown that linear detectors have low complexity but offer inferior performance. In this paper, we analytically quantify the diversity orders of linear equalizers for linear precoded OFDM systems, and prove that they are unable to collect full diversity. To improve the performance of linear equalizers, we further propose to use a lattice reduction (LR) technique to help collect diversity. The LR-aided linear equalizers are shown to achieve maximum diversity order (i.e., the one collected by the ML detector), but with low complexity that is comparable to that of conventional linear equalizers. The theoretical findings are corroborated by simulation results.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Lattice-reduction aided equalization for OFDM systems","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/T-WC.2009.070987","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/4907423/04907429.pdf","startPage":"1608","endPage":"1613","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/T-WC.2009.070987","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4907423","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4907429","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4907429/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 May 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2009","displayDocTitle":"Lattice-reduction aided equalization for OFDM systems","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"8","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/4907429/","dateOfInsertion":"02 May 2009","publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10627521","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Lattice-reduction aided equalization for OFDM systems","sourcePdf":"1608-tw0904-ma.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.049024S","chronDate":"April  2009","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"4907423","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"4907423","articleId":"4907429","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4907430,"authors":[{"name":"Konstantinos Nikitopoulos","affiliation":["Department of Physics, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Athens, Greece"],"firstName":"Konstantinos","lastName":"Nikitopoulos","id":"37284781800"},{"name":"Stelios Stefanatos","affiliation":["Department of Physics, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Athens, Greece"],"firstName":"Stelios","lastName":"Stefanatos","id":"37392286900"},{"name":"Aggelos K.

In this paper we analyze the capacity of a CR network with average received interference power constraints. Under the assumptions of uniform node placements and a simple power control scheme, the maximum transmit power of a target CR transmitter is characterized by its cumulative distribution function (CDF). We study two CR scenarios for future applications. The first scenario is called the CR based central access network, which aims at providing broadband access to CR devices. In the second scenario, the so-called CR assisted virtual multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) network, CR is used to improve the access capability of a cellular system. The uplink ergodic channel capacities of both scenarios are derived and analyzed with an emphasis on understanding the impact of numbers of primary users and CR users on the capacity. Numerical and simulation results suggest that the CR based central access network is more suitable for less-populated rural areas where a relatively low density of primary receivers is expected; while the CR assisted virtual MIMO network performs better in urban environments with a dense population of mobile CR users.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On capacity of cognitive radio networks with average interference power constraints","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2009.071075","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/4907423/04907431.pdf","startPage":"1620","endPage":"1625","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2009.071075","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4907423","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4907431","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4907431/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 May 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2009","displayDocTitle":"On capacity of cognitive radio networks with average interference power constraints","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"8","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/4907431/","dateOfInsertion":"02 May 2009","publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10627523","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On capacity of cognitive radio networks with average interference power constraints","sourcePdf":"1620-tw0904-wang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.059469S","chronDate":"April  2009","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"4907423","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"116","xplore-issue":"4907423","articleId":"4907431","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4907433,"authors":[{"name":"Myung-Sun Baek","affiliation":["UT Communication Research Institute, Sejong University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Myung-Sun","lastName":"Baek","id":"37267295900"},{"name":"Young-Hwan You","affiliation":["UT Communication Research Institute, Sejong University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Young-Hwan","lastName":"You","id":"37269122600"},{"name":"Hyoung-Kyu Song","affiliation":["UT Communication Research Institute, Sejong University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Hyoung-Kyu","lastName":"Song","id":"37270117500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1536-1276"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2248"}],"articleNumber":"4907433","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":26,"citationCountPatent":4,"totalDownloads":670},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/organizations/society/sp/index.html#pub"}],"abstract":"An efficient MIMO signal detection technique with low complexity is presented for MIMO-OFDM systems.

The technique is demonstrated for 8PSK over the Digital Video Broadcasting-Satellite-Second Generation (DVB-S2) channel.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2009.071412","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4907423","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2009.071412","endPage":"1648","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/4907423/04907434.pdf","startPage":"1644","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Semianalytic BER for PSK","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 May 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4907434/","displayDocTitle":"Semianalytic BER for PSK","volume":"8","issue":"4","accessionNumber":"10627525","dateOfInsertion":"02 May 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4907434/","publicationDate":"April 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Semianalytic BER for PSK","sourcePdf":"1644-tw0904-core.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.070813S","chronDate":"April  2009","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"4907423","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"4907423","articleId":"4907434","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4907440,"authors":[{"name":"Hassan A.

Our analytic performance analysis, verified by Monte Carlo simulations, shows that our low-complexity estimator is not only robust to both Gaussian and non-Gaussian noises, but also insensitive to nonisotropic scattering observed at the mobile. The estimator performs very well in both two- and three-dimensional propagation environments. The robustness against both nonisotropic scattering and line of sight can be further increased, by taking advantage of resolvable paths in wideband fading channels, due to the differences among the Doppler spectra observed at different paths. We also extend this technique to base stations with antenna arrays. By exploiting the spatial information, the proposed space-time estimator exhibits excellent performance over a wide range of noise power, nonisotropic scattering, and line-of-sight component, verified by simulation. The utility of the new method is further demonstrated by applying it to the measured data.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fading","Performance analysis","Scattering","Base stations","Noise robustness","Gaussian noise","Working environment noise","Spatial resolution","Wideband","Antennas and propagation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fading channels","mobile radio","Monte Carlo methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nonparametric mobile speed estimation","wideband fading channel","performance analysis","Monte Carlo simulation","Doppler spectra","antenna array","line-of-sight component"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Doppler estimation","velocity estimation","fading channels","multipath channels","correlation","Doppler spectrum","multiple antennas","macrocell"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TWC.2009.060091","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/4907423/04907441.pdf","startPage":"1683","endPage":"1692","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4907423","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2009.060091","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Nonparametric mobile speed estimation in fading channels: Performance analysis and experimental results","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4907441","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Nonparametric mobile speed estimation in fading channels: Performance analysis and experimental results","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4907441/","volume":"8","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4907441/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"10627515","dateOfInsertion":"02 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 May 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Nonparametric mobile speed estimation in fading channels: Performance analysis and experimental results","sourcePdf":"1683-tw0904-zhang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.07583S","chronDate":"April  2009","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"4907423","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"4907423","articleId":"4907441","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4907444,"authors":[{"name":"Majid Nasiri Khormuji","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, ACCESS Linnaeus Center, Stockholm, Sweden"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/4907423/4907444/4907444-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Majid N.

In the proposed scheme, if the relay decodes the received message successfully, it re-encodes the message using the same channel code as the one used at the source, but retransmits only a fraction of the codeword. We analyze the proposed scheme and optimize the cooperation level (i.e., the fraction of the message that the relay should transmit). We compare our scheme with conventional repetition in which the relay retransmits the entire decoded message, with parallel coding, and additionally with dynamic decode-and-forward (DDF). We provide a finite-SNR analysis for all the collaborative schemes. The analysis reveals that the proposed partial repetition method can provide a gain of several dB over conventional repetition. It also shows that in general, power allocation is less important provided that one optimally allocates bandwidth. Surprisingly, the proposed scheme is able to achieve the same performance as that of parallel coding for some relay network configurations, but at a much lower complexity.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2009.070674","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2009.070674","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/4907423/04907444.pdf","startPage":"1716","endPage":"1725","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4907423","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cooperative transmission based on decode-and-forward relaying with partial repetition coding","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Cooperative transmission based on decode-and-forward relaying with partial repetition coding","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4907444/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2009","isJournal":true,"volume":"8","issue":"4","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10627508","dateOfInsertion":"02 May 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4907444/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 May 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cooperative transmission based on decode-and-forward relaying with partial repetition coding","sourcePdf":"1716-tw0904-khormuji.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.074855S","chronDate":"April  2009","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"4907423","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"57","xplore-issue":"4907423","articleId":"4907444","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4907450,"authors":[{"name":"Qi Ling","affiliation":["Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/4907423/4907450/4907450-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Qi Ling received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from the University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China, in 2003, and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical and computer engineering from Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI, in 2006 and 2007, respectively.

Relying on time-frequency diversity over large spectrum, FH systems are robust against hostile jamming interference. However, the spectral efficiency of existing FH systems is very low due to inappropriate use of the total available bandwidth. To improve the system capacity, in this paper, we propose an innovative message-driven frequency hopping (MDFH) scheme. Unlike in traditional FH where the hopping pattern of each user is determined by a pre-selected pseudo-random (PN) sequence, inMDFH, part of the message stream will be acting as the PN sequence, and transmitted through hopping frequency control. As a result, system efficiency is increased significantly since additional information transmission is achieved at no extra cost on either bandwidth or power. We further enhance MDFH by allowing simultaneous transmissions over multiple frequency bands. The enhanced MDFH scheme, named E-MDFH, can achieve high spectral efficiency, and can readily be extended to an FH-based collision-free multiple access scheme. Quantitative performance analysis on the proposed schemes demonstrates that: transmission through hopping frequency control essentially introduces another dimension to the signal space, and the corresponding coding gain can increase the system efficiency by multiple times.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/4907423/04907450.pdf","startPage":"1773","endPage":"1782","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2009.071255","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2009.071255","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4907423","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4907450","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Message-driven frequency hopping: Design and analysis","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bandwidth","Frequency control","System analysis and design","Time frequency analysis","Robustness","Jamming","Interference","Costs","Performance analysis","Performance gain"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["diversity reception","frequency hop communication","jamming","multi-access systems","random sequences","time-frequency analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["message-driven frequency hopping system","time-frequency diversity","jamming interference","spectral efficiency","pseudo-random sequence","PN sequence","information transmission","collision-free multiple access scheme","quantitative performance analysis","signal space"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Spread spectrum","anti-jamming","message-driven frequency hopping","physical layer security"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4907450/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 May 2009","displayDocTitle":"Message-driven frequency hopping: Design and analysis","volume":"8","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/4907450/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10627527","dateOfInsertion":"02 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Message-driven frequency hopping: Design and analysis","sourcePdf":"1773-tw0904-ling.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.055972S","chronDate":"April  2009","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"4907423","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"4907423","articleId":"4907450","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4907451,"authors":[{"name":"J.

A new class of distributed space time block codes called Co-ordinate Interleaved Distributed Space-Time Codes (CIDSTC) are introduced where, in the first phase, the source transmits a T-length complex vector to all the relays and in the second phase, at each relay, the in-phase and quadrature component vectors of the received complex vectors at the two antennas are interleaved and processed before forwarding them to the destination. Compared to the scheme proposed by Jing-Hassibi, for T \u2265 4R, while providing the same asymptotic diversity order of 2R, CIDSTC scheme is shown to provide asymptotic coding gain with the cost of negligible increase in the processing complexity at the relays. However, for moderate and large values of P, CIDSTC scheme is shown to provide more diversity than that of the scheme proposed by Jing-Hassibi. CIDSTCs are shown to be fully diverse provided the information symbols take value from an appropriate multi-dimensional signal set.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2009.071303","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/4907423/04907451.pdf","startPage":"1783","endPage":"1791","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4907423","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2009.071303","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 May 2009","displayDocTitle":"Co-ordinate Interleaved Distributed Space-Time Coding for two-antenna-relays networks","volume":"8","issue":"4","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4907451/","dateOfInsertion":"02 May 2009","publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10627528","isJournal":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4907451/","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Co-ordinate Interleaved Distributed Space-Time Coding for two-antenna-relays networks","sourcePdf":"1783-tw0904-harshan.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.061872S","chronDate":"April  2009","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"4907423","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"4907423","articleId":"4907451","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-15"},{"_id":4907452,"authors":[{"name":"Shi Cheng","affiliation":["ArrayComm LLC, San Jose, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/4907423/4907452/4907452-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Shi Cheng received the B.E. and M.S. degrees in electrical engineering from Southeast University, Nanjing, China in 2000 and 2003 respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from West Virginia Unversity, Morgantown, WV in 2007.

The symmetric information rate for continuous-phase frequency-shift keying (CPFSK) over an AWGN channel may be estimated by considering the system to be a finite-state Markov channel and executing a BCJR-like algorithm. In this paper, the estimated symmetric information rate is used along with the exact expression for the 99% power bandwidth to determine the information-theoretic tradeoff between energy and spectral efficiency for CPFSK modulation. Using this tradeoff, the code rate and modulation index are jointly optimized for a particular spectral efficiency and alphabet size. Codes are then designed for the optimized system. The codes are comprised of variable nodes (which represent irregular repetition codes), check nodes (which represent single parity-check codes), and an interleaver connecting the variable and check nodes. The degree distributions of the code are optimized from the system's EXIT chart by using linear programming. Additional details of the code design, including labeling and interleaver design, are also discussed. Simulation results show that the optimized coded systems achieve bit error rates within 0.4 dB of the information-theoretic limits at BER = 10\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">-5</sup>\n.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/4907423/04907452.pdf","startPage":"1792","endPage":"1802","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2009.071311","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2009.071311","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4907423","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4907452","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Coherent continuous-phase frequency-shift keying: Parameter optimization and code design","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Frequency shift keying","Design optimization","Information rates","Bit error rate","AWGN channels","Frequency estimation","Bandwidth","Modulation","Parity check codes","Joining processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["AWGN channels","channel capacity","channel coding","continuous phase modulation","frequency shift keying","interleaved codes","linear programming","Markov processes","spectral analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["coherent continuous-phase frequency-shift keying","parameter optimization","symmetric information rate","modulation-constrained transmission system","information-theory","AWGN channel","finite-state Markov channel","BCJR-like algorithm","modulation index","spectral efficiency","EXIT chart","linear programming","interleaved code design","capacity-approaching code"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Continuous-phase modulation","CPM","Capacity","Channel coding"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4907452/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 May 2009","displayDocTitle":"Coherent continuous-phase frequency-shift keying: Parameter optimization and code design","volume":"8","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/4907452/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10627531","dateOfInsertion":"02 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Coherent continuous-phase frequency-shift keying: Parameter optimization and code design","sourcePdf":"1792-tw0904-cheng.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.091164S","chronDate":"April  2009","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"4907423","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"4907423","articleId":"4907452","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4907453,"authors":[{"name":"Payam Rabiei","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Technology, Dallas, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/4907423/4907453/4907453-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Payam Rabiei (S'05) received the B.

The maximum channel capacity (MCC) construction preserves the mutual information between the transmit and the received vectors while sacrificing diversity. The system designer can switch between the two constructions through a simple parameter change based on the operating signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), signal constellation size and number of receive antennas. Thanks to their special algebraic structure, both constructions enjoy low-complexity ML decoding proportional to the square of the signal constellation size making them attractive alternatives to existing full-diversity full-rate STBCs in [6], [3] which have high ML decoding complexity proportional to the fourth order of the signal constellation size. Furthermore, we design a differential transmission scheme for our proposed STBC, derive the exact ML differential decoding rule, and compare its performance with competitive schemes. Finally, we investigate transceiver design and performance of our proposed STBC in spatial multiple-access scenarios and over frequency-selective channels.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4907453/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"8","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","dateOfInsertion":"02 May 2009","accessionNumber":"10627532","htmlLink":"/document/4907453/","displayDocTitle":"New rate-2 STBC design for 2 TX with reduced-complexity maximum likelihood decoding","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"New rate-2 STBC design for 2 TX with reduced-complexity maximum likelihood decoding","sourcePdf":"1803-tw0904-rabiei.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.086404S","chronDate":"April  2009","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"4907423","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"4907423","articleId":"4907453","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4907455,"authors":[{"name":"Harry Z.

CSF filtering is a simple form of space-frequency coding (SFC) and may be viewed as a generalization of cyclic delay diversity (CDD) where the cyclic delays are replaced by CSF filters. CSF is applicable to both traditional multiple-input multiple-output systems with co-located transmit antennas and cooperative diversity systems with decode-and-forward relaying and distributed transmit antennas. Similar to CDD and in contrast to other SFC schemes, CSF filtering does not require any changes to the receiver compared to single-antenna transmission. Based on the asymptotic pairwise error probability of the overall system we derive an optimization criterion for the CSF filters for co-located and distributed transmit antennas, respectively. We show that the optimum CSF filters are independent of the interleaver if they do not exceed a certain length. If this length is exceeded, the adopted interleaver has to be carefully taken into account in the CSF filter design. For several special cases we derive closed-form solutions for the optimum CSF filters and for the general case we provide various CSF filter design methods. Our simulation results show that CSF filtering can achieve significant performance gains over existing CDD schemes.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cyclic space-frequency filtering for BICM-OFDM systems with multiple co-located or distributed transmit antennas","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/T-WC.2008.071441","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/4907423/04907455.pdf","startPage":"1825","endPage":"1835","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/T-WC.2008.071441","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4907423","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4907455","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4907455/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 May 2009","xploreNote":"This article is a duplicate added to the April issue in error.

In this article, UWMAC, a distributed Medium Access Control (MAC) protocol designed for UW-ASNs, is introduced. The proposed MAC protocol is a transmitter-based Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) scheme that incorporates a novel closed-loop distributed algorithm to jointly set the optimal transmit power and code length. CDMA is the most promising physical layer and multiple access technique for UW-ASNs because it is robust to frequency-selective fading, it compensates for the effect of multipath at the receiver, and it allows receivers to distinguish among signals simultaneously transmitted by multiple devices. UW-MAC aims at achieving three objectives, i.e., guarantee i) high network throughput, ii) low channel access delay, and iii) low energy consumption. It is demonstrated that UW-MAC simultaneously achieves these three objectives in deep water communications (where the ocean depth is more than 100 m), which are usually not severely affected by multipath. In shallow water communications, which may be heavily affected by multipath, it dynamically finds the optimal trade-off among these objectives according to the application requirements. UW-MAC is the first protocol that leverages CDMA properties to achieve multiple access to the scarce underwater bandwidth, while other protocols tailored for this environment have considered CDMA merely from a physical layer perspective. Experiments show that UW-MAC outperforms many existing MAC protocols tuned for the underwater environment under different architecture scenarios and simulation settings.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2009.080195","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/4907423/04907458.pdf","startPage":"1899","endPage":"1909","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2009.080195","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4907423","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A CDMA-based Medium Access Control for UnderWater Acoustic Sensor Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4907458","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 May 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4907458/","displayDocTitle":"A CDMA-based Medium Access Control for UnderWater Acoustic Sensor Networks","volume":"8","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10627537","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4907458/","dateOfInsertion":"02 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A CDMA-based Medium Access Control for UnderWater Acoustic Sensor Networks","sourcePdf":"1899-tw0904-pompili.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.07006S","chronDate":"April  2009","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"4907423","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"182","xplore-issue":"4907423","articleId":"4907458","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":4907459,"authors":[{"name":"Jun Zhang","affiliation":["Wireless Networking and Communications Group, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Technology, Austin, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/4907423/4907459/4907459-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jun Zhang (S'05) received the B.

Multi-cell block diagonalization is used to coordinate the transmissions across multiple BTSs in the same cluster. To satisfy per-BTS power constraints, three combined precoder and power allocation algorithms are proposed with different performance and complexity tradeoffs. For inter-cluster coordination, the coordination area is chosen to balance fairness for edge users and the achievable sum rate. It is shown that a small cluster size (about 7 cells) is sufficient to obtain most of the sum rate benefits from clustered coordination while greatly relieving channel feedback requirement. Simulations show that the proposed coordination strategy efficiently reduces interference and provides a considerable sum rate gain for cellular MIMO networks.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2009.080180","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4907423","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2009.080180","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/4907423/04907459.pdf","startPage":"1910","endPage":"1921","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Networked MIMO with clustered linear precoding","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 May 2009","displayDocTitle":"Networked MIMO with clustered linear precoding","volume":"8","issue":"4","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2009","dateOfInsertion":"02 May 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4907459/","publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10627538","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4907459/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Networked MIMO with clustered linear precoding","sourcePdf":"1910-tw0904-zhang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.121533S","chronDate":"April  2009","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"4907423","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"377","xplore-issue":"4907423","articleId":"4907459","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4907460,"authors":[{"name":"Ariel Lionel Sacramento","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Concordia University, Montreal, QUE, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/4907423/4907460/4907460-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ariel Sacramento (B.Eng'05, M.A.Sc'08) was born in Benin.

In the presence of multiuser interference, resulting from the cross-correlation between users' code sequences, the full system diversity cannot be achieved when using the conventional matched receiver. In this paper we investigate the performance of space-time spreading (STS) and transmit diversity in the uplink of a MIMO DS-CDMA system over Nakagami-m fast-fading channels. The space-time system employs N = 2 transmit antennas and L receive antennas at the user side and base-station, respectively. We analyze the performance of the system when a linear decorrelator detector is employed to mitigate the effect of multiuser interference. In our analysis, we start by finding the probability density function (pdf) of the signal-to-interference ratio (SINR) at the output of the space-time combiner. Using this pdf, we derive a closed form expression for the bit-error rate (BER) for binary phase-shift keying (BPSK) transmission. The accuracy of the derived pdf and BER expression are verified using simulations, for different values of fading figure m and number of users.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2009.080229","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2009.080229","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/4907423/04907460.pdf","startPage":"1944","endPage":"1952","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4907423","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiuser decorrelator detectors in MIMO CDMA systems over Nakagami fading channels","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4907460/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 May 2009","displayDocTitle":"Multiuser decorrelator detectors in MIMO CDMA systems over Nakagami fading channels","volume":"8","issue":"4","dateOfInsertion":"02 May 2009","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10627539","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4907460/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiuser decorrelator detectors in MIMO CDMA systems over Nakagami fading channels","sourcePdf":"1944-tw0904-sacramento.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.072812S","chronDate":"April  2009","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"4907423","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4907423","articleId":"4907460","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4907461,"authors":[{"name":"Kyu-Sung Hwang","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Korea University, Seoul, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/4907423/4907461/4907461-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Kyu-Sung Hwang (S'05) received the B.Eng. degree in electrical engineering in 2004 and the M.S. degree in School of Electrical Engineering in 2006, both from Korea University, Seoul, Korea, where he is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree in the School of Electrical Engineering.

In order to satisfy the spectral efficiency and the bit error rate (BER) requirements, adaptive modulation is applied to our proposed scheme. We derive the average spectral efficiency, average BER and outage probability for the performance analysis of our proposed scheme. For a more tractable analysis, we start with an upper bound for the combined signal-to-noise ratio at the destination and provide closed-form expressions for independent non-identically distributed Rayleigh fading conditions. Our analytical-based numerical results are validated by some computer-based simulations. These results show that our proposed scheme leads to a considerable improvement in the performance of cooperative diversity systems.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/4907423/04907461.pdf","startPage":"1953","endPage":"1961","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2009.080381","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2009.080381","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4907423","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4907461","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance analysis of incremental opportunistic relaying over identically and non-identically distributed cooperative paths","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Performance analysis","Relays","Bit error rate","Protocols","Signal analysis","Upper bound","Signal to noise ratio","Closed-form solution","Rayleigh channels","Computational modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive modulation","diversity reception","error statistics","protocols","Rayleigh channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["performance analysis","incremental opportunistic relaying protocol","nonidentically distributed cooperative path diversity system","amplify-and-forward transmission","relay channel selection scheme","bit error rate","average BER","adaptive modulation","average spectral efficiency","outage probability","signal-to-noise ratio","Rayleigh fading channel","computer-based simulation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cooperative diversity","amplify-and-forward","adaptive modulation","incremental relaying","opportunistic relaying"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4907461/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 May 2009","displayDocTitle":"Performance analysis of incremental opportunistic relaying over identically and non-identically distributed cooperative paths","volume":"8","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/4907461/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10627540","dateOfInsertion":"02 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance analysis of incremental opportunistic relaying over identically and non-identically distributed cooperative paths","sourcePdf":"1953-tw0904-hwang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.081303S","chronDate":"April  2009","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"4907423","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"104","xplore-issue":"4907423","articleId":"4907461","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":4907462,"authors":[{"name":"Raymond Yim","affiliation":["Mitsubishi Electric Research Laboratories, Inc., Cambridge, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/4907423/4907462/4907462-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Raymond Yim (S'00-M'07) received his B.

In this paper, we introduce an extremely fast contention-based multiple access algorithm that selects the best node and requires only local information of the priorities of the nodes. The algorithm, which we call variable power multiple access selection (VP-MAS), uses the local channel state information from the accessing nodes to the receiver, and maps the priorities onto the receive power. It is based on a key result that shows that mapping onto a set of discrete receive power levels is optimal, when the power levels are chosen to exploit packet capture that inherently occurs in a wireless physical layer. The VP-MAS algorithm adjusts the expected number of users that contend in each step and their respective transmission powers, depending on whether previous transmission attempts resulted in capture, idle channel, or collision. We also show how reliable information regarding the total received power at the receiver can be used to improve the algorithm by enhancing the feedback mechanism. The algorithm detects the packet from the best node in 1.5 to 2.1 slots, which is considerably lower than the 2.43 slot average achieved by the best algorithm known to date.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4907462/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"8","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","dateOfInsertion":"02 May 2009","accessionNumber":"10627541","htmlLink":"/document/4907462/","displayDocTitle":"Fast Multiple Access Selection through variable power transmissions","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast Multiple Access Selection through variable power transmissions","sourcePdf":"1962-tw0904-yim.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.083648S","chronDate":"April  2009","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"4907423","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"4907423","articleId":"4907462","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4907463,"authors":[{"name":"Mark Felegyhazi","affiliation":["International Computer Science Institute (ICSI), Berkeley, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/4907423/4907463/4907463-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Mark F\u00e9legyh\u00e1zi received the M.

Both problems are studied in a game-theoretic setting, where devices aim to selfishly maximize their share of the available bandwidth. As for the first problem, we show that the ldquoprice of anarchyrdquo is close to 1, that is, Nash equilibria imply nearly system optimal allocations of the available channels. For the second problem, we design a game such that it admits a unique Nash equilibrium that is is both fair and Pareto-optimal.

This kind of transmission is known as physical layer multicasting. Unfortunately, when any user fails to receive the data correctly, the information must be retransmitted to all the users, resulting in a waste of radio resources. Thus, it is important to investigate the outage probability of multicast channels, which is defined as the probability that the smallest maximum achievable rate among all of the users is smaller than a specified transmission rate. In this paper, we consider the use of multiple antenna multicast channels where the transmitter is equipped with M\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">t</sub>\n antennas and independent data is transmitted on each antenna to K users. Using extreme value theory, we derive a closed form limiting distribution that the exact distribution of the multicasting channel converges to when the number of users K is taken to infinity. From this result, we find upper and lower-bounds on the outage probability. It is shown that for a given outage probability the upper-bound becomes sufficiently tight to approximate the exact outage probability with K such that it converges to the exact one with a speed faster than Theta (K\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">-1/M</sup>\n \n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">t</sup>\n). Using this upper-bound, we identify conditions on the transmission rate and the transmit power necessary to maintain constant outage performance as K increases. Specifically, the transmission rate should be decreased as Theta (K\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">-1/M</sup>\n \n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">t</sup>\n) or the transmit power should be increased as Theta (K\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1/M</sup>\n \n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">t</sup>\n). This means that the outage performance improves as the number of transmit antennas increases, because spatial diversity can be well exploited. However, this increase in the number of transmit antennas requires a significant cost. To improve the performance without requiring additional cost, we consider a multiple-slot multicasting that transmits the same data over multiple slots and an antenna subset selection scheme that transmits the data over some subset of the transmit antennas. It is shown that the transmission rate of multiple-slot scheme can be increased when the number of slots is carefully chosen and the diversity-multiplexing trade-off is the same as that of K = 1. Also, the gain in the transmission rate from selecting some subset of the transmit antennas is derived.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4907464/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 May 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10627543","volume":"8","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/4907464/","publicationDate":"April 2009","dateOfInsertion":"02 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Outage performance of multi-antenna multicasting for wireless networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Outage performance of multi-antenna multicasting for wireless networks","sourcePdf":"1996-tw0904-park.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.064607S","chronDate":"April  2009","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"4907423","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"4907423","articleId":"4907464","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4907465,"authors":[{"name":"Juan M.

In this paper, we set to define simple extensions for distributed medium access control (MAC) protocols that optimize the transmission of network-coded packets independently of the actual network coding algorithm. The main characteristic of the proposed protocol is that it improves the efficiency of coding decisions and allows verifying the decodability of packets before they are transmitted. The aforementioned goals are achieved first by adopting minor extensions to the channel access scheme, and second by introducing a new algorithm that manages intelligently the data packets that are stored at the MAC queue of each network node. The later algorithm improves the knowledge of a node regarding the available correct coding opportunities by the use of opportunistic acknowledgments, and by maintaining virtual buffers for the overheard data packets. For the proposed protocol, we also develop an analytical performance model that is used for evaluating its performance in conjunction with simulations. Extensive simulations are presented for several ad hoc network topologies that test all the features of the proposed protocol. Significant throughput improvement can be observed when our protocol is compared with network coding schemes that do not exploit the full potential of opportunistic listening.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2009.080396","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/4907423/04907466.pdf","startPage":"2014","endPage":"2023","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2009.080396","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4907423","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Wireless network coding with improved opportunistic listening","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4907466","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 May 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4907466/","displayDocTitle":"Wireless network coding with improved opportunistic listening","volume":"8","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10627545","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4907466/","dateOfInsertion":"02 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wireless network coding with improved opportunistic listening","sourcePdf":"2014-tw0904-argyriou.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.059199S","chronDate":"April  2009","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"4907423","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"44","xplore-issue":"4907423","articleId":"4907466","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4907467,"authors":[{"name":"Behrouz Maham","affiliation":["UNIK-University Graduate Center, University of Oslo, Norway"],"firstName":"Behrouz","lastName":"Maham","id":"37298195400"},{"name":"Are Hjorungnes","affiliation":["UNIK-University Graduate Center, University of Oslo, Norway"],"firstName":"Are","lastName":"Hjorungnes","id":"37270835900"},{"name":"Giuseppe Abreu","affiliation":["Center for Wireless Communications, University of Oulu, Finland"],"firstName":"Giuseppe","lastName":"Abreu","id":"37298699700"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1536-1276"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2248"}],"articleNumber":"4907467","dbTime":"28 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":65,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":588},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/organizations/society/sp/index.html#pub"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Space time codes","Fading","Maximum likelihood decoding","Block codes","Maximum likelihood detection","Wireless networks","MIMO","Wireless communication","Digital relays","Phase shift keying"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","decoding","diversity reception","error statistics","linear codes","maximum likelihood detection","orthogonal codes","phase shift keying","quadrature amplitude modulation","Rayleigh channels","space-time codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed GABBA space-time codes","amplify-and-forward relay networks","cooperative communications","virtual multiple-antennas","slow fading wireless environments","wireless relay networks","linear orthogonal decoding","full-rate code","full-diversity space-time block codes","source-destination link","MPSK","M-QAM","maximum likelihood detection","symbol error probability","Rayleigh fading channels"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Wireless relay network","distributed space-time codes","performance analysis","cooperative communications"]}],"abstract":"Cooperative communications via distributed space-time codes has been recently proposed as a way to form virtual multiple-antennas that provide dramatic gains in slow fading wireless environments. In this paper, we consider the design of practical distributed space-time codes for wireless relay networks using the amplify-and-forward (AF) scheme, where each relay transmits a scaled version of the linear combinations of the received symbols and their complex conjugate. We employ GABBA codes, which are systematically constructed, orthogonally decodable, full-rate, full-diversity space-time block codes, in a distributed fashion. Our scheme is valid for any number of relays with linear orthogonal decoding in the destination, which make it feasible to employ large numbers of potential relays to improve the diversity order. We generalize the distributed space-time codes in AF mode when the source-destination link contributes in both phases of the transmission. Assuming MPSK or M-QAM constellations and maximum likelihood (ML) detection, we derive an approximate formula for the symbol error probability of the investigated scheme in Rayleigh fading channels. The analytical results are confirmed by simulations, indicating both the accuracy of the analysis, and the fact that low-complexity, flexible, and high-performing distributed space-time block codes can be designed based on GABBA codes.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2009.080501","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/4907423/04907467.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2009.080501","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4907423","startPage":"2036","endPage":"2045","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed GABBA space-time codes in amplify-and-forward relay networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4907467","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Distributed GABBA space-time codes in amplify-and-forward relay networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4907467/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 May 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"8","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10627546","dateOfInsertion":"02 May 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4907467/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed GABBA space-time codes in amplify-and-forward relay networks","sourcePdf":"2036-tw0904-maham.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.084475S","chronDate":"April  2009","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"4907423","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"65","xplore-issue":"4907423","articleId":"4907467","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4907468,"authors":[{"name":"Konstantinos Mammasis","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University of Strathclyde, UK"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/4907423/4907468/4907468-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Konstantinos Mammasis received his MSc degree in Microwaves Engineering and Wireless Subsystems Design from the University of Surrey, Surrey, U.K., in 2004.

The derivation of the novel SFC function uses a Probability Density Function (PDF) originating from the field of directional statistics, the Von Mises Fisher (VMF) PDF. In particular the novel SFC function is based on the concept of mixture modeling and hence uses a mixture of VMF distributions. Since the SFC function is dependent on the Angle of Arrival (AoA) as well as the power of each cluster, the more appropriate power azimuth colatitude spectrum term has been used. The choice of distribution is validated with the use of Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) experimental data that was obtained in an outdoor drive test campaign in Germany. A mixture can be composed of any number of clusters and this is mainly dependent on the clutter type encountered in the propagation environment. The parameters of the individual clusters within the mixture are derived and an estimation of those parameters is achieved using the soft-Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm. The results indicate that the proposed model fits well with the MIMO data.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2009.080505","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/4907423/04907468.pdf","startPage":"2046","endPage":"2055","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2009.080505","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4907423","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spatial Fading Correlation model using mixtures of Von Mises Fisher distributions","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4907468","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 May 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4907468/","displayDocTitle":"Spatial Fading Correlation model using mixtures of Von Mises Fisher distributions","volume":"8","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10627547","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4907468/","dateOfInsertion":"02 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spatial Fading Correlation model using mixtures of Von Mises Fisher distributions","sourcePdf":"2046-tw0904-mammasis.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.10197S","chronDate":"April  2009","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"4907423","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"37","xplore-issue":"4907423","articleId":"4907468","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4907469,"authors":[{"name":"Emre Aktas","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Hacettepe University, Ankara, Turkey"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/4907423/4907469/4907469-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Emre Aktas (S'96-M'03) received the B.S. degree from Middle East Technical University, Ankara, Turkey, in 1996 and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from The Ohio State University, Columbus, in 1998 and 2002, respectively.

The proposed Bayesian network graph for the demodulator includes the channel parameters as explicit nodes, allowing the combined estimation of the channel and information bearing symbols with the aid of pilot symbols. Since direct application of BP is not tractable for this model, the algorithm is obtained by introducing approximations of the message distributions appropriately. The proposed algorithm is parallel in nature, is suitable for sparse channels, and can be easily extended to coded systems for joint demodulation and decoding. The numerical results show near-optimal performance in the minimum mean squared error sense for a small example, and a performance better than that of iterative semi-blind equalization with batch matrix-based estimators for the general case.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2009.080506","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/4907423/04907469.pdf","startPage":"2056","endPage":"2066","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2009.080506","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4907423","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Belief propagation with Gaussian priors for pilot-assisted communication over fading ISI channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4907469","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 May 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4907469/","displayDocTitle":"Belief propagation with Gaussian priors for pilot-assisted communication over fading ISI channels","volume":"8","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10627548","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4907469/","dateOfInsertion":"02 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Belief propagation with Gaussian priors for pilot-assisted communication over fading ISI channels","sourcePdf":"2056-tw0904-aktas.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.108252S","chronDate":"April  2009","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"4907423","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4907423","articleId":"4907469","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4907470,"authors":[{"name":"Heunchul Lee","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Korea University, Seoul, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/4907423/4907470/4907470-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Heunchul Lee (S'04, M'08) received the B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from Korea University, Seoul, Korea, in 2003, 2005, and 2008, respectively.

The rotation matrices are utilized to derive the weight vector for the maximum-norm combining (MNC) process of two complex vectors, which provides a constructive basis for a new beamforming method. The proposed transmit beamforming method uses successive column combining of MIMO channel matrices based on MNC, and as a result, an approximate solution to the optimum beamforming vector is obtained.

In AL-OSA the spectrum is shared with the secondary service in circumstances in which the primary service is totally inactive however, in IL-OSA access to the spectrum is allowed subject to an interference threshold. For both cases we develop analytical frameworks to analyze the impact of the primary network activity on the achievable capacity of the secondary service. Simulation results confirm our analysis and also show that in cases where higher activity is in the primary network, IL-OSA is the more appropriate OSA method.

It is assumed that the CR protects the PR transmission by applying the so-called ldquointerference-temperaturerdquo constraint, whereby the CR is allowed to transmit regardless of the PR's on/off status provided that the resultant interference power level at the PR receiver is kept below some predefined threshold. For the fading PR and CR channels, the interference-power constraint at the PR receiver is usually one of the following two types: one is to regulate the average interference power (AIP) over all different fading states, while the other is to limit the peak interference power (PIP) at each fading state. From the CR's perspective, given the same average and peak power threshold, the AIP constraint is more favorable than the PIP counterpart because of its more flexibility for dynamically allocating transmit powers over different fading states. On the contrary, from the perspective of protecting the PR, the more restrictive PIP constraint appears at a first glance to be a better option than the AIP. Some surprisingly, this paper shows that in terms of various forms of capacity limits achievable for the PR fading channel, e.g., the ergodic and outage capacities, the AIP constraint is also superior over the PIP. This result is based upon an interesting interference diversity phenomenon, where randomized interference powers over the fading states in the AIP case are more advantageous over deterministic ones in the PIP case for minimizing the resultant PR capacity losses. Therefore, the AIP constraint results in larger fading channel capacities than the PIP for both the CR and PR transmissions.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2009.080714","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/4907423/04907474.pdf","startPage":"2112","endPage":"2120","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2009.080714","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4907423","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On peak versus average interference power constraints for protecting primary users in cognitive radio networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4907474","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 May 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4907474/","displayDocTitle":"On peak versus average interference power constraints for protecting primary users in cognitive radio networks","volume":"8","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10627553","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4907474/","dateOfInsertion":"02 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On peak versus average interference power constraints for protecting primary users in cognitive radio networks","sourcePdf":"2112-tw0904-zhang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.05637S","chronDate":"April  2009","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"4907423","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"225","xplore-issue":"4907423","articleId":"4907474","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4907475,"authors":[{"name":"Alireza Attar","affiliation":["Centre for Telecommunications Research, King''s College, London, UK"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/4907423/4907475/4907475-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Alireza Attar (S'04-M'08) received his B.Sc. and M.Sc. in electrical and electronic engineering in 1999 and 2004, respectively.

We assume the primary system is a cellular OFDM-based network operating in uplink. We develop an optimum resource allocation strategy, using cooperative game theory, which guarantees the primary's required QoS and allocates an achievable rate at a given bit error rate for the secondary, when possible. The proposed cognitive radio game (CRG) is a network-assisted resource management method, where users (both primary and secondary) inform the primary system's BS of their channel state information and power limitation and the base station calculates the optimum sub-channel and power allocation for all users. Using Game theoretic axiom of fairness, i.e., Nash Bargaining Solutions (NBS), we develop an alternative efficient and fair resource allocation and compare its performance with the proposed CRG method. We use Sequential Quadratic Programming (SQP) to solve the proposed non-linearly constrained CRG optimization problem.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2009.080884","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/4907423/04907475.pdf","startPage":"2121","endPage":"2131","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2009.080884","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4907423","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cognitive Radio game for secondary spectrum access problem","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4907475","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 May 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4907475/","displayDocTitle":"Cognitive Radio game for secondary spectrum access problem","volume":"8","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10627554","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4907475/","dateOfInsertion":"02 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cognitive Radio game for secondary spectrum access problem","sourcePdf":"2121-tw0904-attar.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.069528S","chronDate":"April  2009","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"4907423","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"109","xplore-issue":"4907423","articleId":"4907475","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4907476,"authors":[{"name":"Wei Xu","affiliation":["National Mobile Communications Research Lab, South-East University, Nanjing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/4907423/4907476/4907476-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Wei Xu (S'07) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electrical engineering in 2003 and 2006, respectively.

As spreading code, flexible in length double-padded modified prime code (DPMPC) has been deployed. The performance has been analyzed in terms of the users' channel utilization factor in the network. The results are comparable with previous schemes and indicate that the architecture is power efficient and capable of accommodating greater number of active users with advantage of shorter code length (i.e., higher bit rate). It is shown that for a maximum bit rate the network performance can be improved by reducing the channel utilization. However, when each user in the network has a fixed bit rate, optimal channel utilization can be set for the overall network performance. Additionally, each IP packet is buffered only at the edge of this network, thus the buffer delay is significantly reduced compared with traditional routing schemes. Since the optical encoder is adjusted for number of packets rather than individually, the encoder adjusting time is also significantly reduced. Analytical results clearly indicate that coherent OCDMA technique can be a fine candidate for the future ultra fast optical IP networks.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"IP Routing and Traffic Analysis in Coherent Optical CDMA Networks","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2008.2007574","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/50/4840636/04907479.pdf","startPage":"1262","endPage":"1268","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2008.2007574","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4840636","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4907479","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4907479/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 May 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"May15,  2009","displayDocTitle":"IP Routing and Traffic Analysis in Coherent Optical CDMA Networks","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"27","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/4907479/","dateOfInsertion":"02 May 2009","publicationDate":"May15, 2009","accessionNumber":"10615939","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"IP Routing and Traffic Analysis in Coherent Optical CDMA Networks","sourcePdf":"jlt-ghafouri-shiraz-2007574.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.049393S","chronDate":"May15,  2009","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"4840636","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"4840636","articleId":"4907479","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4907554,"authors":[{"name":"Hisham A.

This standard will use the concept of cognitive radio based on dynamic spectrum access to provide wireless access services in a large coverage area. A brief overview of the current state of the IEEE 802.22 standard is provided with a particular emphasis on the spectrum management (i.e., spectrum sensing and dynamic spectrum access) in this standard. Key research issues related to spectrum trading among TV broadcasters, WRAN service providers, and IEEE 802.22-based cognitive radio users are identified. To this end, a hierarchical spectrum trading model is presented to analyze the interaction among WRAN service providers, TV broadcasters, and WRAN users. In this model a double auction is established among multiple TV broadcasters and WRAN service providers who sell and buy the radio spectrum (i.e., TV bands), respectively. Again, multiple WRAN service providers compete with each other by adjusting the service price charged to WRAN users. We propose a joint spectrum bidding and service pricing model for WRAN service providers to maximize their profits. A non-cooperative game is formulated to obtain the solution in terms of the number of TV bands and the service price of a service provider. Numerical results are presented on the performance of this joint spectrum bidding and pricing model.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4907555/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 May 2009","volume":"16","issue":"2","accessionNumber":"10628309","publicationDate":"April 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4907555/","dateOfInsertion":"05 May 2009","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic spectrum access in IEEE 802.22- based cognitive wireless networks: a game theoretic model for competitive spectrum bidding and pricing","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic spectrum access in IEEE 802.22- based cognitive wireless networks: a game theoretic model for competitive spectrum bidding and pricing","sourcePdf":"006HOSSAIN LAYOUT.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.057786S","chronDate":"April  2009","xplore-pub-id":"7742","isNumber":"4907549","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7742","citationCount":"94","xplore-issue":"4907549","articleId":"4907555","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4907559,"authors":[{"name":"Youssef Charfi","affiliation":["Bell Canada Limited, Canada"],"bio":{"p":["YOUSSEF CHARFI (charfi@ist.osaka-u.ac.jp) received his doctorate in computer science from the University of Konstanz, Germany, in 2004.

However, they raise new challenges such as the transmission of visual data with high computational and bandwidth requirements in mainly low-power visual sensor networks.

Central to such an approach is that machine learning techniques typically rely upon summaries or features of the program. The quality of these features is critical to the accuracy of the resulting machine learned algorithm; no machine learning method will work well with poorly chosen features. However, due to the size and complexity of programs, theoretically there are an infinite number of potential features to choose from. The compiler writer now has to expend effort in choosing the best features from this space. This paper develops a novel mechanism to automatically find those features which most improve the quality of the machine learned heuristic. The feature space is described by a grammar and is then searched with genetic programming and predictive modeling. We apply this technique to loop unrolling in GCC 4.3.1 and evaluate our approach on a Pentium 6. On a benchmark suite of 57 programs, GCC's hard-coded heuristic achieves only 3% of the maximum performance available, while a state of the art machine learning approach with hand-coded features obtains 59%. Our feature generation technique is able to achieve 76% of the maximum available speedup, outperforming existing approaches.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"22-25 March 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4907653/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"10627019","publicationDate":"March 2009","conferenceDate":"22-25 March 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4907653/","dateOfInsertion":"05 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Automatic Feature Generation for Machine Learning Based Optimizing Compilation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automatic Feature Generation for Machine Learning Based Optimizing Compilation","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"3576a081.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059745S","chronDate":"22-25 March 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4907622","isNumber":"4907623","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4907622","citationCount":"55","xplore-issue":"4907623","articleId":"4907653","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4907664,"authors":[{"name":"Abhishek Udupa","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Automati, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, India","Dept. of Computer Science and Automation"],"firstName":"Abhishek","lastName":"Udupa","id":"37632954900"},{"name":"R.

This model allows programmers to specify the structure of a program as a set of filters that act upon data, and a set of communication channels between them. The StreamIt graphs describe task, data and pipeline parallelism which can be exploited on modern graphics processing units (GPUs), as they support abundant parallelism in hardware. In this paper, we describe the challenges in mapping StreamIt to GPUs and propose an efficient technique to software pipeline the execution of stream programs on GPUs. We formulate this problem - both scheduling and assignment of filters to processors - as an efficient integer linear program (ILP), which is then solved using ILP solvers. We also describe a novel buffer layout technique for GPUs which facilitates exploiting the high memory bandwidth available in GPUs. The proposed scheduling utilizes both the scalar units in GPU, to exploit data parallelism, and multiprocessors, to exploit task and pipeline parallelism. Further it takes into consideration the synchronization and bandwidth limitations of GPUs, and yields speedups between 1.87X and 36.83X over a single threaded CPU.","doi":"10.1109/CGO.2009.20","publicationTitle":"2009 International Symposium on Code Generation and Optimization","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Symposium on Code Generation and Optimization","pdfPath":"/iel5/4907622/4907623/04907664.pdf","startPage":"200","endPage":"209","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CGO.2009.20","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4907623","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Software Pipelined Execution of Stream Programs on GPUs","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4907664","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-25 March 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4907664/","displayDocTitle":"Software Pipelined Execution of Stream Programs on GPUs","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2009","accessionNumber":"10627030","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4907664/","conferenceDate":"22-25 March 2009","dateOfInsertion":"05 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Software Pipelined Execution of Stream Programs on GPUs","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"3576a200.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.103328S","chronDate":"22-25 March 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4907622","isNumber":"4907623","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4907622","citationCount":"53","xplore-issue":"4907623","articleId":"4907664","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4907686,"authors":[{"name":"Evan Welbourne","affiliation":["University of Washington, Seattle, WA, US"],"bio":{"p":["Evan Welbourne is a PhD student in the University of Washington's Department of Computer Science and Engineering.

Our investigations include experimental data from a u-blox high-sensitivity GPS receiver as well as simulation data derived from a ray tracing based deterministic GPS channel model. Our primary goal is to get a deeper understanding of the complex interactions of the GPS signals on their paths to indoor locations. In the first part we will verify that the indoor propagation of the satellite signals leads to characteristic and repeatable patterns in the observation data. Thanks to the sidereal repeatability of the GPS satellite constellation, this verification can be carried out using measurements performed on two successive days. In the second part we will present the ray tracing based deterministic simulation model used to perform the GPS outdoor-to-indoor channel simulations, show the results and compare the measured data and the results obtained with the ray tracer.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Ray tracing supported precision evaluation for GPS indoor positioning","publicationTitle":"2009 6th Workshop on Positioning, Navigation and Communication","doi":"10.1109/WPNC.2009.4907798","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 6th Workshop on Positioning, Navigation and Communication","pdfPath":"/iel5/4839103/4907789/04907798.pdf","startPage":"15","endPage":"22","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WPNC.2009.4907798","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4907789","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4907798","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4907798/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-19 March 2009","displayDocTitle":"Ray tracing supported precision evaluation for GPS indoor positioning","conferenceDate":"19-19 March 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4907798/","dateOfInsertion":"05 May 2009","publicationDate":"March 2009","accessionNumber":"10626856","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ray tracing supported precision evaluation for GPS indoor positioning","confLoc":"Hannover, Germany","sourcePdf":"03-53-88840-final_l_cd.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061599S","chronDate":"19-19 March 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4839103","isNumber":"4907789","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4839103","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4907789","articleId":"4907798","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4907834,"authors":[{"name":"Ville Honkavirta","affiliation":["Tampere University of Technology, Finland"],"firstName":"Ville","lastName":"Honkavirta","id":"38367970900"},{"name":"Tommi Perala","affiliation":["Tampere University of Technology, Finland"],"firstName":"Tommi","lastName":"Perala","id":"37298707400"},{"name":"Simo Ali-Loytty","affiliation":["Tampere University of Technology, Finland"],"firstName":"Simo","lastName":"Ali-Loytty","id":"38266379500"},{"name":"Robert Piche","affiliation":["Tampere University of Technology, Finland"],"firstName":"Robert","lastName":"Piche","id":"37298707100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3292-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3293-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4907834","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":310,"citationCountPatent":11,"totalDownloads":3393},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wireless LAN","Fingerprint recognition","Databases","Filters","Testing","RAKE receivers","Position measurement","Filtering","Bayesian methods","Performance evaluation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Kalman filters","mathematical analysis","probability","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["WLAN","radio signal strength measurements","location fingerprinting methods survey","static estimation","filtering methods","Bayesian filter","Kalman filter","mathematical formulation","radio map database","location estimation"]}],"abstract":"The term ldquolocation fingerprintingrdquo covers a wide variety of methods for determining receiver position using databases of radio signal strength measurements from different sources.

However, a general assumption underlying the use of space-time codes is that the channel should be quasi-static, which is violated from the nature of high mobility environment. Additionally, large Doppler spread causing rapidly time-varying channels could destroy the orthogonality among neighboring subcarriers and lead to intercarrier-interference (ICI). This paper studies the extension of the POSTBC-OFDM scheme to the rapidly time-varying channel case by adopting sectorized antenna reception technique which could reduce Doppler spread and the channels time-variance by restricting the incident angle of imping waves to a finite range. Simulation results show that this proposed system is not only suitable for high mobility condition, but also can get a better tradeoff among performance, code rate and complexity of receiver.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Networks Security, Wireless Communications and Trusted Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4908190/4908191/04908204.pdf","startPage":"17","endPage":"20","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Networks Security, Wireless Communications and Trusted Computing","doi":"10.1109/NSWCTC.2009.40","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NSWCTC.2009.40","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4908191","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4908204","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"POSTBC-OFDM with Sectorized Antenna Reception over Rapidly Time-Varying Channels","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Time-varying channels","OFDM modulation","Block codes","Diversity reception","Transmitting antennas","Decoding","Receiving antennas","Wireless communication","Space technology","Broadband antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antennas","broadband networks","OFDM modulation","orthogonal codes","radio networks","space-time codes","time-varying channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["POSTBC-OFDM","sectorized antenna reception","time-varying channels","pseudo-orthogonal space-time block coded OFDM system","intercarrier-interference","Doppler spread","wireless broadband communication system"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["POSTBC","Sectorized Antenna","Rapidly Time-varying Channel","Tradeoff"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4908204/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-26 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"POSTBC-OFDM with Sectorized Antenna Reception over Rapidly Time-Varying Channels","isConference":true,"volume":"1","htmlLink":"/document/4908204/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10627041","dateOfInsertion":"05 May 2009","conferenceDate":"25-26 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"POSTBC-OFDM with Sectorized Antenna Reception over Rapidly Time-Varying Channels","confLoc":"Wuhan, China","sourcePdf":"3610a017.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054076S","chronDate":"25-26 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4908190","isNumber":"4908191","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4908190","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4908191","articleId":"4908204","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4908208,"authors":[{"name":"Su Hu","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory of Communication, University of Electronic Science and Technology, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Su","lastName":"Hu","id":"37290175200"},{"name":"Gang Wu","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory of Communication, University of Electronic Science and Technology, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Gang","lastName":"Wu","id":"37290990500"},{"name":"Gang Yang","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory of Communication, University of Electronic Science and Technology, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Gang","lastName":"Yang","id":"37631250400"},{"name":"Shaoqian Li","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory of Communication, University of Electronic Science and Technology, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Shaoqian","lastName":"Li","id":"37279617000"},{"name":"Bo Gao","affiliation":["Luoyang, China"],"firstName":"Bo","lastName":"Gao","id":"37629237200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3610-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4223-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4908208","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":326},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","OFDM modulation","Pulse shaping methods","Frequency division multiplexing","Quadrature amplitude modulation","Intersymbol interference","Bit error rate","Prototypes","Communication system security","National security"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","error statistics","fading channels","Gaussian processes","intersymbol interference","OFDM modulation","quadrature amplitude modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["preamble based channel estimation","OFDM-OQAM system","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","offset QAM system","intersymbol interference","extended Gaussian function","BER","bit error rate"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["OFDM/OQAM","channel estimation","preamble"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we propose a modified preamble based channel estimation for the orthogonal frequency division multiplex/offset QAM (OFDM/OQAM).

The subcarrier allocation is different from the traditional scheme in which the subcarriers are allocated passively. In our process, each of the subcarriers is viewed as a learning automaton to choose the most satisfying user. We adopt the linear reward-inaction algorithm to obtain the Nash equilibrium. Theoretic analysis is given. Simulation results show our allocation scheme has good convergence, and the performance gap is tolerated compared with the complete channel state case.","doi":"10.1109/NSWCTC.2009.58","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Networks Security, Wireless Communications and Trusted Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Networks Security, Wireless Communications and Trusted Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4908190/4908191/04908211.pdf","startPage":"47","endPage":"51","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NSWCTC.2009.58","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4908191","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint Subcarrier and Power Allocation in Uplink OFDMA Systems with Incomplete Channel State Information","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4908211","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-26 April 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4908211/","displayDocTitle":"Joint Subcarrier and Power Allocation in Uplink OFDMA Systems with Incomplete Channel State Information","volume":"1","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10627048","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4908211/","conferenceDate":"25-26 April 2009","dateOfInsertion":"05 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint Subcarrier and Power Allocation in Uplink OFDMA Systems with Incomplete Channel State Information","confLoc":"Wuhan, China","sourcePdf":"3610a047.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039554S","chronDate":"25-26 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4908190","isNumber":"4908191","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4908190","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4908191","articleId":"4908211","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-28"},{"_id":4908225,"authors":[{"name":"Ken Long","affiliation":["School of Information Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Ken","lastName":"Long","id":"37627629700"},{"name":"Wei-ling Wu","affiliation":["School of Information Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Wei-ling","lastName":"Wu","id":"37280426600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3610-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4223-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4908225","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":274},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Array signal processing","MIMO","Time division synchronous code division multiple access","Electronic mail","Linear antenna arrays","Base stations","Downlink","Information security","Wireless communication","Computer networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3G mobile communication","antenna arrays","array signal processing","code division multiple access","MIMO communication","transmitting antennas","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["enhanced multi-antenna solution","beam forming antennas","3G long-term evolution","TD-SCDMA","multi-input-multi-output","MIMO","uncorrelated multi-channels","3GPP special channel model","transmitted antennas"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Beamforming","MiMO","LTE","TD-SCDMA"]}],"abstract":"Beam forming has been greatly applied in TD-SCDMA, but in the 3G long-term evolution (LTE), multi-antenna solution aims to use multi-input-multi-output (MIMO). Usually MIMO requires enough large antenna space to ensure uncorrelated multi-channels, whereas beam forming antennas need small antenna space. But this yearspsila research has shown the combination feasibility of beam forming and MIMO. In this paper, the 3GPP special channel model (SCM) has been researched and the beam forming is added to the LTE. Because of the beam forming combination, the number of transmitted antennas can not be restricted by 3GPP specification about LTE. Simulation results validate the efficiency. This gives a smooth evolution path from TD-SCDMA to LTE, and the advantage of beam forming can be inherited.","doi":"10.1109/NSWCTC.2009.216","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Networks Security, Wireless Communications and Trusted Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4908190/4908191/04908225.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4908191","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NSWCTC.2009.216","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Networks Security, Wireless Communications and Trusted Computing","startPage":"112","endPage":"115","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Enhanced Multi-antenna Solution through Beamforming to 3G Long-Term Evolution","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4908225","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-26 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"An Enhanced Multi-antenna Solution through Beamforming to 3G Long-Term Evolution","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4908225/","isConference":true,"volume":"1","htmlLink":"/document/4908225/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10627062","dateOfInsertion":"05 May 2009","conferenceDate":"25-26 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Enhanced Multi-antenna Solution through Beamforming to 3G Long-Term Evolution","confLoc":"Wuhan, China","sourcePdf":"3610a112.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048787S","chronDate":"25-26 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4908190","isNumber":"4908191","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4908190","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4908191","articleId":"4908225","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4908230,"authors":[{"name":"Guoqiang Gong","affiliation":["Sch. of Electron. & Inf.

This paper is to present our investigations of the behaviors of the MIMO ultra-wide-band-impulse radio (UWB-IR) systems, which will contribute to optimal designs for the low-power high-speed data communication over unlicensed bandwidth spanning several GHz, such as IEEE 802.15 families. Our investigations are based on that without requiring any channel estimation procedure we develop and analyze three no coherent transceiver models. The simulations for our investigations show that the Poisson distribution of the path arriving will affect the signal-noise ratio (SNR) and that for the Nakagami distributed multipath fading channel the ldquomrdquo factor, together with receiver number will impact on the SNR on the MIMO UWB-IR systems.","doi":"10.1109/NSWCTC.2009.45","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Networks Security, Wireless Communications and Trusted Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Networks Security, Wireless Communications and Trusted Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4908190/4908191/04908233.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NSWCTC.2009.45","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4908191","startPage":"147","endPage":"150","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analyses of MIMO UWB-IR Transceiver in Statistical Models","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4908233","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Analyses of MIMO UWB-IR Transceiver in Statistical Models","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-26 April 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4908233/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"25-26 April 2009","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10627069","dateOfInsertion":"05 May 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4908233/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analyses of MIMO UWB-IR Transceiver in Statistical Models","confLoc":"Wuhan, China","sourcePdf":"3610a147.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.079344S","chronDate":"25-26 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4908190","isNumber":"4908191","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4908190","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4908191","articleId":"4908233","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4908236,"authors":[{"name":"Gaoping Hu","affiliation":["Information Engineering Department, Communication University of China, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Gaoping","lastName":"Hu","id":"37628962800"},{"name":"Dong Li","affiliation":["Information Engineering Department, Communication University of China, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Dong","lastName":"Li","id":"37290663400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3610-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4223-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4908236","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":207},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"EM-Based Channel Estimation for MIMO OFDM System","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","MIMO","OFDM","Time varying systems","Frequency estimation","Computational modeling","Fading","Degradation","Mean square error methods","Computational complexity"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["block codes","channel estimation","computational complexity","expectation-maximisation algorithm","MIMO communication","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive EM-based channel estimation algorithm","MIMO OFDM system","multiple input multiple output communication","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing system","time-varying frequency selective environment","expectation-maximization algorithm","space-time block coded","computational complexity"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["mimo ofdm","channel estimation","expectation"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4908236","abstract":"In this paper, a low complexity adaptive EM-based channel estimation algorithm is proposed for Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) systems in slow time-varying frequency selective environment.

In this paper, we apply the exponential correlation model to model channel spatial correlation and provide the theoretical bit-error probabilities (BEPs) of the robust scheme combing STBC with beamforming based on this model. Analytical and simulation results are presented to verify our theoretical analysis. The results also show that the performance gain obtained by this robust scheme increases evidently as the maximum Doppler frequency becomes larger.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4908313/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-26 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"1","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","dateOfInsertion":"05 May 2009","accessionNumber":"10627149","htmlLink":"/document/4908313/","conferenceDate":"25-26 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"Performance Analysis of a Scheme Combined STBC with Beamforming in Spatial Correlated Channel","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance Analysis of a Scheme Combined STBC with Beamforming in Spatial Correlated Channel","confLoc":"Wuhan, China","sourcePdf":"3610a496.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041137S","chronDate":"25-26 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4908190","isNumber":"4908191","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4908190","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4908191","articleId":"4908313","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4908322,"authors":[{"name":"Yahui Yang","affiliation":["School of Software & Microelectronics, Peking University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yahui","lastName":"Yang","id":"37406571900"},{"name":"Yujie Wu","affiliation":["School of Software & Microelectronics, Peking University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yujie","lastName":"Wu","id":"37635630800"},{"name":"Min Xia","affiliation":["School of Software & Microelectronics, Peking University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Min","lastName":"Xia","id":"37627903100"},{"name":"Zhijing Qin","affiliation":["School of Software & Microelectronics, Peking University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zhijing","lastName":"Qin","id":"37630952000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3610-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4223-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4908322","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":24,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":342},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radiofrequency identification","Genetic algorithms","Wireless networks","Biological cells","Optimization methods","Chromosome mapping","Electromagnetic coupling","Binary codes","Wireless communication","Computer networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","radiofrequency identification","telecommunication network planning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["RFID network planning method","radio frequency identification","genetic algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["RFID","Wireless Network Plan","multi-target optimization","genetic algorithm"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4908322","abstract":"Radio frequency identification (RFID) has a widespread application in reality, and RFID wireless network planning is one of the most important issues in this field.

Due to the spatial diversity, the signals received at the different antennas are faded independently, resulting in an independent log-likelihood function (LLF) for each antenna. To resolve the multi-objective dilemma when choosing one signal estimation for multiple receive-antenna-branches, the proposed MOO-GA selects a subset of the Pareto Front for further evolution. By getting rid of the sub-optimal in terms of multi-objectives, the MOO-GA enhances the evolution probability of the optimal in terms of each single objective.

We propose a method of calibrating amplitude-phase errors of RF channels of DBF transmitting antenna together with its realization architecture. A maximum likelihood estimation method is used to calculate the amplitude-phase calibration coefficients of the channels and a compensation matrix is constructed in the FPGA so as to accomplish the calibration procedure. In order to get rid of the nonlinear operation in the estimation algorithm, adjustment is made and thus improves the dynamic range of the algorithm.

For in-cluster antenna selection in the second step, the IC-PQRD algorithm could largely improve the system outage capacity with low computational complexity and low SER.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Transmit Antenna Selection for the Distributed MIMO Systems","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Networks Security, Wireless Communications and Trusted Computing","doi":"10.1109/NSWCTC.2009.79","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Networks Security, Wireless Communications and Trusted Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4908190/4908381/04908502.pdf","startPage":"449","endPage":"453","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NSWCTC.2009.79","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4908381","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4908502","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4908502/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-26 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"Transmit Antenna Selection for the Distributed MIMO Systems","conferenceDate":"25-26 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"2","htmlLink":"/document/4908502/","dateOfInsertion":"05 May 2009","publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10627324","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Transmit Antenna Selection for the Distributed MIMO Systems","confLoc":"Wuhan, China","sourcePdf":"3610b449.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051641S","chronDate":"25-26 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4908190","isNumber":"4908381","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4908190","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"4908381","articleId":"4908502","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4908545,"authors":[{"name":"Jingwen Tian","affiliation":["Department of Automatic Control, Beijing Union University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jingwen","lastName":"Tian","id":"37290884900"},{"name":"Meijuan Gao","affiliation":["Department of Automatic Control, Beijing Union University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Meijuan","lastName":"Gao","id":"37289044200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3610-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4223-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4908545","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":617},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4908545","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Intrusion detection","Genetic algorithms","Neural networks","Convergence","Artificial neural networks","Uncertainty","Artificial intelligence","Information security","Wireless communication","Computer networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["backpropagation","genetic algorithms","neural nets","security of data"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["network intrusion detection method","floating-point code genetic algorithm","neural network","BP network","intrusion behaviors"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Network","intrusion detection","genetic algorithm","neural network"]}],"doi":"10.1109/NSWCTC.2009.228","pdfPath":"/iel5/4908190/4908381/04908545.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Networks Security, Wireless Communications and Trusted Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Networks Security, Wireless Communications and Trusted Computing","startPage":"619","endPage":"622","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4908381","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NSWCTC.2009.228","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Network Intrusion Detection Method Based on High Speed and Precise Genetic Algorithm Neural Network","abstract":"Aimed at the network intrusion behaviors are characterized with uncertainty, complexity, diversity and dynamic tendency and the advantages of neural network, an intrusion detection method based on high speed and precise genetic algorithm neural network is presented in this paper.

Therefore, many scholars in our country have been trying their best to find a better solution, and their good-willing prospect will come true because of the emergence of the MIMO-OFDM technology. However, MIMO-OFDM, the same as the OFDM system, whose outputs are the accumulation of a number of orthogonal subcarriers, causes higher PAPR and restricts its development and application by this shortcoming. So a new theory is proposed - copy theory based on the traditional method. According to the simulation results, we can see this new technique not only reduces the PAPR of the system, but also saves the extra expenditure and improves frequency spectrum efficiency.","doi":"10.1109/NSWCTC.2009.164","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Networks Security, Wireless Communications and Trusted Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Networks Security, Wireless Communications and Trusted Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4908190/4908381/04908578.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NSWCTC.2009.164","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4908381","startPage":"751","endPage":"754","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reduction of Peak-to-Average Power Ratio in MIMO-OFDM System Based on the Copy Theory","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4908578","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Reduction of Peak-to-Average Power Ratio in MIMO-OFDM System Based on the Copy Theory","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-26 April 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4908578/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"25-26 April 2009","isConference":true,"volume":"2","publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10627400","dateOfInsertion":"05 May 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4908578/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reduction of Peak-to-Average Power Ratio in MIMO-OFDM System Based on the Copy Theory","confLoc":"Wuhan, China","sourcePdf":"3610b751.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.035952S","chronDate":"25-26 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4908190","isNumber":"4908381","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4908190","xplore-issue":"4908381","articleId":"4908578","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4908580,"authors":[{"name":"Zhao Zhijin","affiliation":["School of Communication Engineering, Hangzhou Dianzi University, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Zhao","lastName":"Zhijin","id":"37643223600"},{"name":"Pu Junjie","affiliation":["School of Communication Engineering, Hangzhou Dianzi University, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Pu","lastName":"Junjie","id":"37645630400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3610-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4223-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4908580","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":80},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4908580","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Detection Method of DS-CDMA Signal Based on the Quadratic Fourth-order Moment Chip","abstract":"DS-CDMA in the modern civil and military communications is widely used. Due to its low power spectral density, the DS-CDMA signal always floods in the background noise, bringing difficulties to the signalpsilas reconnaissance. Therefore, DS-CDMA signal detection has attracted attention of researchers. Because the fourth-order moment chip is blind to the arbitrary Gaussian noise, the detection method based on the quadratic fourth-order moment chip of DS-CDMA is proposed. The proposed method can reduce the estimation error and computation complexity. Experimental results show that the detection performance of the method is better than that of the double frequency method, spectrum-reprocessing method and cepstrum method. When the false alarm probability is 1%, the detection probability of presented methods reaches above 90% at SNR -24dB.","doi":"10.1109/NSWCTC.2009.14","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Networks Security, Wireless Communications and Trusted Computing","startPage":"759","endPage":"762","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NSWCTC.2009.14","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4908381","pdfPath":"/iel5/4908190/4908381/04908580.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Networks Security, Wireless Communications and Trusted Computing","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiaccess communication","Military communication","Floods","Background noise","Reconnaissance","Signal detection","Gaussian noise","Estimation error","Frequency","Cepstrum"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","military communication","probability","signal detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DS-CDMA","quadratic fourth-order moment chip","civil communications","military communications","signal detection","false alarm probability"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["WCDMA signal","quadrtic fourth-order moment chip","signal detecting","lower SNR"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A Detection Method of DS-CDMA Signal Based on the Quadratic Fourth-order Moment Chip","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4908580/","isConference":true,"volume":"2","htmlLink":"/document/4908580/","accessionNumber":"10627402","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"05 May 2009","publicationDate":"April 2009","conferenceDate":"25-26 April 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"25-26 April 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Detection Method of DS-CDMA Signal Based on the Quadratic Fourth-order Moment Chip","confLoc":"Wuhan, China","sourcePdf":"3610b759.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.034021S","chronDate":"25-26 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4908190","isNumber":"4908381","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4908190","xplore-issue":"4908381","articleId":"4908580","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4908913,"authors":[{"name":"Magnus Sjalander","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Chalmers University of Technology, Goteborg, Sweden"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/92/5208586/4908913/4908913-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Magnus Sj\u00e4lander received the M.Sc. degree in computer science and engineering from Lule\u00e5 University of Technology, Sweden, in 2003 and the Ph.D. degree in computer engineering from Chalmers University of Technology, G\u00f6teborg, Sweden, in 2008.","He is a Digital Hardware Designer with Aeroflex Gaisler, G\u00f6teborg.

The twin-precision technique can reduce the power dissipation by adapting a multiplier to the bitwidth of the operands being computed. The technique also enables an increased computational throughput, by allowing several narrow-width operations to be computed in parallel. We describe how to apply the twin-precision technique also to signed multiplier schemes, such as Baugh-Wooley and modified-Booth multipliers. It is shown that the twin-precision delay penalty is small (5%-10%) and that a significant reduction in power dissipation (40%-70%) can be achieved, when operating on narrow-width operands. In an application case study, we show that by extending the multiplier of a general-purpose processor with the twin-precision scheme, the execution time of a Fast Fourier Transform is reduced with 15% at a 14% reduction in datapath energy dissipation. All our evaluations are based on layout-extracted data from multipliers implemented in 130-nm and 65-nm commercial process technologies.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/92/5208586/04908913.pdf","startPage":"1233","endPage":"1246","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","doi":"10.1109/TVLSI.2008.2002107","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVLSI.2008.2002107","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5208586","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4908913","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiplication Acceleration Through Twin Precision","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Acceleration","Power dissipation","Concurrent computing","Throughput","Arithmetic","Digital systems","Fast Fourier transforms","Energy dissipation","Propagation delay","Computer science"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["delays","digital arithmetic","fast Fourier transforms","logic gates"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["integer multipliers","multiplication acceleration","Baugh-Wooley multipliers","modifled-Booth multipliers","twin-precision delay penalty","fast Fourier transform","power dissipation","datapath energy dissipation","narrow-width operands","general-purpose processor","two-input AND gate"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Area efficient","Baugh\u2013Wooley multiplier","high speed","low power","modified-Booth multiplier","SIMD","twin-precision"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4908913/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 May 2009","displayDocTitle":"Multiplication Acceleration Through Twin Precision","volume":"17","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/4908913/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10828389","dateOfInsertion":"18 August 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiplication Acceleration Through Twin Precision","sourcePdf":"tvlsi-msjlander-2002107.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.088751S","chronDate":"Sept.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"5208586","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"5208586","articleId":"4908913","onlineDate":"05 May 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4908914,"authors":[{"name":"G.

The proposed path generation algorithm allows us to find a path satisfying arbitrary initial and final conditions, specified in terms of position and velocity. Our method assumes that aircraft structural and dynamic limitations can be translated in a turn radius constraint; therefore, the generated paths satisfy a constraint on the minimum admissible turning radius. The proposed algorithm for the path tracking guarantees, under specified assumptions, that the tracking error, both in position and in attitude, asymptotically tends to zero. The work has been carried out with reference to the UAV of the Italian Aerospace Research Center (CIRA).

They may be seen as extensions of the so-called PD+ algorithm to the bounded input case. With respect to previous works on the topic, the proposed approaches give a global solution to the problem through static feedback. Moreover, they are not defined using a specific sigmoidal function, but any one on a set of saturation functions. Consequently, each of the proposed schemes actually constitutes a family of globally stabilizing bounded controllers. Furthermore, the bound of such saturation functions is explicitly considered in their definition. Hence, the control gains are not tied to satisfy any saturation-avoidance inequality and may consequently take any positive value, which may be considered beneficial for performance-adjustment/improvement purposes. Further, a class of desired trajectories that may be globally tracked avoiding input saturation is completely characterized. For both proposed control laws, global uniform asymptotic stabilization of the closed-loop system solutions towards the prespecified desired trajectory is proved through a strict Lyapunov function. The efficiency of the proposed schemes is corroborated through experimental results.","doi":"10.1109/TCST.2009.2013938","pdfPath":"/iel5/87/5109813/04908918.pdf","startPage":"934","endPage":"944","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCST.2009.2013938","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5109813","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Global Trajectory Tracking Through Static Feedback for Robot Manipulators With Bounded Inputs","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4908918/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 May 2009","displayDocTitle":"Global Trajectory Tracking Through Static Feedback for Robot Manipulators With Bounded Inputs","volume":"17","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"23 June 2009","accessionNumber":"10721238","publicationDate":"July 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4908918/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Global Trajectory Tracking Through Static Feedback for Robot Manipulators With Bounded Inputs","sourcePdf":"tcst-azavala-rio-2013938.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034734S","chronDate":"July  2009","isNumber":"5109813","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"87","citationCount":"75","articleId":"4908918","onlineDate":"05 May 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-07"},{"_id":4908927,"authors":[{"name":"Zhenqing Ke","affiliation":["Department of Mathematical Sciences, University of Bath, Bath, UK"],"firstName":"Zhenqing","lastName":"Ke","id":"37638121700"},{"name":"Hartmut Logemann","affiliation":["Department of Mathematical Sciences, University of Bath, Bath, UK"],"firstName":"Hartmut","lastName":"Logemann","id":"37299272300"},{"name":"Richard Rebarber","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics, University of Nebraska, Lincoln, Lincolnshire, NE, USA"],"firstName":"Richard","lastName":"Rebarber","id":"37333383400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9286"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2523"},{"format":"CD","value":"2334-3303"}],"articleNumber":"4908927","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":13,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":119},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Control Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieeecss.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Servomechanisms","Control systems","Transfer functions","Tuning","Tracking loops","Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","Steady-state","Frequency","Algebra","Regulators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["asymptotic stability","multidimensional systems","sampled data systems","servomechanisms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sampled-data servomechanism","stable well-posed systems","disturbance rejection problem","exponential stability","well-posed infinite-dimensional systems","sampled-data low-gain controller"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Disturbance rejection","infinite-dimensional systems","low-gain control","sampled-data control","tracking"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4908927","abstract":"In this technical note, an approximate tracking and disturbance rejection problem is solved for the class of exponentially stable well-posed infinite-dimensional systems by invoking a simple sampled-data low-gain controller (suggested by the internal model principle).

The different components of a time-series data set such as trend, seasonal, cyclical, and calendar variations can separately be modeled in STM methodology. A case study at the Dublin, Ireland, city center with serious traffic congestion is performed to illustrate the forecasting strategy.

The sparsity and performance of these methods depend on selecting an appropriate kernel function, which is typically achieved using a cross-validation procedure. In this paper, we propose an incremental method for supervised learning, which is similar to the relevance vector machine (RVM) but also learns the parameters of the kernels during model training. Specifically, we learn different parameter values for each kernel, resulting in a very flexible model. In order to avoid overfitting, we use a sparsity enforcing prior that controls the effective number of parameters of the model. We present experimental results on artificial data to demonstrate the advantages of the proposed method and we provide a comparison with the typical RVM on several commonly used regression and classification data sets.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/72/5062541/04908953.pdf","startPage":"926","endPage":"937","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","doi":"10.1109/TNN.2009.2014060","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNN.2009.2014060","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5062541","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4908953","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sparse Bayesian Modeling With Adaptive Kernel Learning","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bayesian methods","Kernel","Predictive models","Gaussian distribution","Supervised learning","Machine learning","Yield estimation","Testing","Additive noise","Computer science"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Bayes methods","learning (artificial intelligence)","regression analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sparse Bayesian modeling","adaptive kernel learning","classification problems","cross-validation procedure","supervised learning","relevance vector machine","classification data sets"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Classification","kernel learning","regression","relevance vector machine (RVM)","sparse Bayesian learning"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Artificial Intelligence","Bayes Theorem","Computer Simulation","Data Interpretation, Statistical","Models, Theoretical","Pattern Recognition, Automated"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4908953/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 May 2009","displayDocTitle":"Sparse Bayesian Modeling With Adaptive Kernel Learning","volume":"20","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/4908953/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10713257","pubMedId":"19423438","dateOfInsertion":"02 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sparse Bayesian Modeling With Adaptive Kernel Learning","sourcePdf":"tnn-alikas-2014060.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.097421S","chronDate":"June  2009","xplore-pub-id":"72","isNumber":"5062541","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"40","xplore-issue":"5062541","articleId":"4908953","onlineDate":"05 May 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4908956,"authors":[{"name":"Zhang Yi","affiliation":["College of Computer Science, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/72/5062541/4908956/4908956-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Zhang Yi received the Ph.D. degree in mathematics from the Institute of Mathematics, The Chinese Academy of Science, Beijing, China, in 1994.","Currently, he is a Professor at the Machine Intelligence Laboratory, College of Computer Science, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China.

The linear threshold transfer function has been regarded as an adequate transfer function for recurrent neural networks. Networks with this transfer function form a class of hybrid analog and digital networks which are especially useful for perceptual computations. Networks in discrete time can directly provide algorithms for efficient implementation in digital hardware. The main contribution of this paper is to establish foundations of permitted and forbidden sets.

IPTV systems require a high level of quality of service (QoS) in order to win customers which are subscribed with cable companies. Packet loss probability is one of the primary QoS parameters whose value affects the user experience and which provides a quantitative measure for customers' perception of the QoS factor in practical networks. Therefore, the online accurate measurement and estimation of the packet loss probability is a key issue to be addressed. Furthermore, the packet loss probability provides the feedback information which can be used in the network based control system to maintain it at a prescribed and negotiated value. In this paper, a reactive estimator (RE) of the packet loss probability is constructed. As all parameters related to the network traffic, the packet loss is a non-linear and non-Gaussian stochastic process. The proposed RE has the capability to adapt to variable stochastic contexts by employing one dynamic item based on the feedback of the real-time loss ratio measurement. A series of experiments are devised on a live network to evaluate the performance of the estimator under multiple traffic arrival models and within various buffer sizes. The numeric results show that the practical estimator is accurate enough to approximate the packet loss probability, such that it can be further used as a feedback parameter in a closed control loop which can keep the packet loss probability close to a prescribed value.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reactive Estimation of Packet Loss Probability for IP-Based Video Services","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting","doi":"10.1109/TBC.2009.2019430","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting","pdfPath":"/iel5/11/4976142/04908971.pdf","startPage":"375","endPage":"385","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBC.2009.2019430","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4976142","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4908971","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4908971/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 May 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2009","displayDocTitle":"Reactive Estimation of Packet Loss Probability for IP-Based Video Services","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"55","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/4908971/","dateOfInsertion":"26 May 2009","publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10666129","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reactive Estimation of Packet Loss Probability for IP-Based Video Services","sourcePdf":"tbc-zhang-2019430.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.13907S","chronDate":"June  2009","xplore-pub-id":"11","isNumber":"4976142","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"11","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4976142","articleId":"4908971","onlineDate":"05 May 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4908974,"authors":[{"name":"Dizan Vasquez","affiliation":["Autonomous Systems Laboratory, Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, Zurich, Switzerland"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6979/5230362/4908974/4908974-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Dizan Vasquez received the Ph.D. degree in computer graphics, computer vision, and robotics from the Institut National Polytechnique de Grenoble, Grenoble, France, in February 2007.","He is a Postoctoral Fellow with the Autonomous Systems Laboratory, Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, Zurich, Switzerland.

Due to the difficulty of modeling the various factors that determine motion (e.g., internal state and perception), this is often tackled by applying machine learning techniques to build a statistical model, using as input a collection of trajectories gathered through a sensor (e.g., camera and laser scanner), and then using that model to predict further motion. Unfortunately, most current techniques use offline learning algorithms, meaning that they are not able to learn new motion patterns once the learning stage has finished. In this paper, we present an approach where motion patterns can be learned incrementally and in parallel with prediction.

Our approach is to design the LDPC code to match the constraints imposed by the hardware architecture, without compromising on the communication performance. The proposed architecture-aware code design procedure involves feature identification, code construction and verification. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our procedure for three cases. If the local memory of the processor is small and it can only process one horizontally partitioned submatrix at a time, we show how the code can be constructed so that the traffic to the global memories is reduced by 2X. If the row weight of the matrix is large and each processor processes a vertically partitioned submatrix, we show how the matrix can be constructed so that the computational load is evenly distributed among the processors. If the processors have no storage capability and all data is stored in global memories, then for the case when all traffic is through a multistage interconnection network, we show how code construction can be used to significantly reduce the number of routing conflicts. In all three cases, the resulting LDPC codes can not only be mapped efficiently onto the multiprocessor platform but also have very good frame error performance.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 May 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4908993/","volume":"57","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/4908993/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10816647","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Architecture-Aware LDPC Code Design for Multiprocessor Software Defined Radio Systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Architecture-Aware LDPC Code Design for Multiprocessor Software Defined Radio Systems","sourcePdf":"57tsp09-cchakrabarti-2022356.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.162883S","chronDate":"Sept.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"5200771","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"5200771","articleId":"4908993","onlineDate":"05 May 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4908999,"authors":[{"name":"Anping Liu","affiliation":["Corning, Inc., Corning, NY, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Anping Liu was born in Hubei, China.

The model analyzes the impacts of pump configurations, fiber lengths, and fiber temperatures on amplifier performance. It shows that counter-pumped amplifiers are capable of generating several times more output than co-pumped amplifiers. To fully take their advantages and deliver the laser output, a delivery fiber should be properly designed to avoid unwanted SBS which can significantly undermine the amplifier performance. On the other hand, for applications requiring delivery fiber at relative low power, the co-pumped amplifier can be an alternative since it can use the gain fiber as the delivery fiber and thus eliminate requiring an additional delivery fiber. The model also analyzes possible approaches for suppressing SBS, such as applying additional heating, the use of SBS suppressing fiber, and increasing core diameter. It shows that applying additional heating to a co-pumped amplifier can increase the output by a factor of 1.7. Finally, the model concludes that a single frequency amplifier can achieve multiple kilowatts output by carefully choosing amplifier design and utilizing SBS suppression technique.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4908999/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July1,  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 May 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4908999/","dateOfInsertion":"26 June 2009","publicationDate":"July1, 2009","accessionNumber":"10733073","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"27","issue":"13","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Comprehensive Modeling of Single Frequency Fiber Amplifiers for Mitigating Stimulated Brillouin Scattering","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comprehensive Modeling of Single Frequency Fiber Amplifiers for Mitigating Stimulated Brillouin Scattering","sourcePdf":"jlt-liu-2005427.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.098902S","chronDate":"July1,  2009","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"5133707","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"5133707","articleId":"4908999","onlineDate":"05 May 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-30"},{"_id":4909005,"authors":[{"name":"Irma Villar","affiliation":["Control Engineering and Power Electronics Area, Technological Research Center, Mondragon, Spain"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/5238769/4909005/4909005-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Irma Villar received the B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees in electronics from the University of Mondrag\u00f3n, Mondrag\u00f3n, Spain, in 2003 and 2005, respectively.

Systems with conventional LQR controllers present good stability properties and are optimal with respect to a certain performance index. However, LQR control does not assure robust stability when the system is highly uncertain. In this paper, a convex model of converter dynamics is obtained taking into account uncertainty of parameters. In addition, the LQR control for switching converters is reviewed. In order to apply the LQR control in the uncertain converter case, we propose to optimize the performance index by using linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). As a consequence, a new robust control method for dc-dc converters is derived. This LMI-LQR control is compared with classical LQR control when designing a boost regulator. Performance of both cases is discussed for load and line perturbations, working at nominal and non nominal conditions. Finally, the correctness of the proposed approach is verified with experimental prototypes.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/5154028/04909006.pdf","startPage":"2548","endPage":"2558","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2009.2017556","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2009.2017556","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5154028","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4909006","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust LQR Control for PWM Converters: An LMI Approach","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robust control","Pulse width modulation converters","Regulators","Control systems","Performance analysis","Optimal control","Robust stability","Power system modeling","Uncertainty","Switching converters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["linear matrix inequalities","linear quadratic control","PWM power convertors","robust control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["robust LQR control","PWM converters","linear quadratic regulators","linear matrix inequalities","robust stability","optimal control"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Optimal control","power electronics","robustness"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4909006/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 May 2009","displayDocTitle":"Robust LQR Control for PWM Converters: An LMI Approach","volume":"56","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/4909006/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2009","accessionNumber":"10736224","dateOfInsertion":"30 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust LQR Control for PWM Converters: An LMI Approach","sourcePdf":"tie-olalla-2017556.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.087019S","chronDate":"July  2009","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"5154028","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"199","xplore-issue":"5154028","articleId":"4909006","onlineDate":"05 May 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-28"},{"_id":4909011,"authors":[{"name":"Christopher C.

Information retrieval techniques such as topic detection and tracking are able to organize news stories as events, in a flat hierarchical structure, within a topic. However, they are incapable of presenting the complex evolution relationships between the events. We are interested to learn not only what the major events are but also how they develop within the topic. It is beneficial to identify the seminal events, the intermediary and ending events, and the evolution of these events. In this paper, we propose to utilize the event timestamp, event content similarity, temporal proximity, and document distributional proximity to model the event evolution relationships between events in an incident. An event evolution graph is constructed to present the underlying structure of events for efficient browsing and extracting of information. Case study and experiments are presented to illustrate and show the performance of our proposed technique. It is found that our proposed technique outperforms the baseline technique and other comparable techniques in previous work.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5076135","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics - Part A: Systems and Humans","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics - Part A: Systems and Humans","pdfPath":"/iel5/3468/5076135/04909011.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TSMCA.2009.2015885","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSMCA.2009.2015885","startPage":"850","endPage":"863","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Discovering Event Evolution Graphs From News Corpora","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 May 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4909011/","displayDocTitle":"Discovering Event Evolution Graphs From News Corpora","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4909011/","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"39","issue":"4","accessionNumber":"10705014","dateOfInsertion":"16 June 2009","publicationDate":"July 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Discovering Event Evolution Graphs From News Corpora","sourcePdf":"tsmca-yang-2015885.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.082922S","chronDate":"July  2009","xplore-pub-id":"3468","isNumber":"5076135","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3468","citationCount":"65","xplore-issue":"5076135","articleId":"4909011","onlineDate":"05 May 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4909012,"authors":[{"name":"Gerald T.

A test bed was built under a simulated driving environment, and a total of 12 subjects participated in two experiment sessions requiring different levels of sleep (partial sleep-deprivation versus no sleep-deprivation) before the experiment. The performance of the subjects was analyzed in a series of stimulus-response and routine driving tasks, which revealed the performance differences of drivers under different sleep-deprivation levels. The experiments further demonstrated that sleep deprivation had greater effect on rule-based than on skill-based cognitive functions: when drivers were sleep-deprived, their performance of responding to unexpected disturbances degraded, while they were robust enough to continue the routine driving tasks such as lane tracking, vehicle following, and lane changing. In addition, we presented both qualitative and quantitative guidelines for designing drowsy-driver detection systems in a probabilistic framework based on the paradigm of Bayesian networks. Temporal aspects of drowsiness and individual differences of subjects were addressed in the framework.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4909020/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 May 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2009","publicationDate":"July 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4909020/","dateOfInsertion":"16 June 2009","accessionNumber":"10705016","volume":"39","issue":"4","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Detection of Driver Fatigue Caused by Sleep Deprivation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Detection of Driver Fatigue Caused by Sleep Deprivation","sourcePdf":"tsmca-yang-2018634.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.078258S","chronDate":"July  2009","xplore-pub-id":"3468","isNumber":"5076135","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3468","citationCount":"54","xplore-issue":"5076135","articleId":"4909020","onlineDate":"05 May 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4909021,"authors":[{"name":"Jianyu Lin","affiliation":["Brain and Mind Research Institute, University of Sydney, NSW, Australia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/83/5161445/4909021/4909021-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jianyu Lin (M'96) received the B.S. degree in physics from Nanjing Normal University, China, and the M.S. degree in electrical engineering and the Ph.D. in physics (acoustics) from Michigan State University, East Lansing.","From July 1996 to January 1998, he was a postdoctorate at the University of Maryland, College Park. from 1998 to 2003, he was a Lecturer at the Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Singapore Polytechnic. from 2003 to 2006, he was a Research Scientist at Temasek Lab, National University of Singapore.

The condensed wavelet packet (CWP) transform is one such decomposition that was recently shown to have coding performance advantages over conventional decompositions. A special feature of the CWP is that its design and implementation are performed in the cyclic frequency domain. While performance gains have been reported, efficient implementations of the CWP (or more generally, efficient implementations of cyclic filter banks) have not yet been fully explored. In this paper, we present efficient block-based implementations of cyclic filter banks along with an analysis of the arithmetic complexity. Block-based cyclic filter bank implementations of the CWP coder are compared with conventional subband/wavelet image coders whose filter banks are implemented in the time domain. It is shown that block-based cyclic filter bank implementations can result in CWP coding systems that outperform the popular image coding systems both in terms of arithmetic complexity and coding performance.","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2009.2019931","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/83/5161445/04909021.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2009.2019931","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5161445","startPage":"1717","endPage":"1723","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient Block-Based Frequency Domain Wavelet Transform Implementations","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4909021","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Efficient Block-Based Frequency Domain Wavelet Transform Implementations","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4909021/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 May 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"18","issue":"8","publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","accessionNumber":"10776299","pubMedId":"19423446","dateOfInsertion":"10 July 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4909021/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient Block-Based Frequency Domain Wavelet Transform Implementations","sourcePdf":"18tip07-jlin-2019931.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.056177S","chronDate":"Aug.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"5161445","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5161445","articleId":"4909021","onlineDate":"05 May 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4909027,"authors":[{"name":"Fei Liu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Wuhan University of China, Wuhan, China","Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/5282654/4909027/4909027-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Fei Liu received the M.Eng. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China, in 2004 and 2008, respectively.","He is currently a Postdoctoral Research Fellow in the Department of Electrical Engineering, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China.

However, in a grid-connected system, an LCL filter may cause resonance which is a disaster for the system's stability. In order to solve the problem, a two-current-loop control strategy, which includes grid-current outer loop and filter-capacitor-current inner loop, is adopted here. The implementation of this strategy is easy, but the tuning procedure is complex since the outer and inner controllers cannot cooperate well if the parameters of the controllers are not suitable. There is no literature which mentions a method to help give out accurate parameters of the controller. The difficulty of designing the controller is that only two feedbacks cannot provide complete information of a three-order LCL filter. A specific method is proposed in this paper to design the controller. The advantage of this method is to provide a way to maximize the utilization of the two feedbacks to get good system performance through parameter determination. The practicability of the method is tested by using bode diagram, and the antidistortion ability of the system is analyzed. Finally, experimental results verify the availability and correctness of the proposed method.","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2009.2021175","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/5282654/04909027.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2009.2021175","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5282654","startPage":"4483","endPage":"4491","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Parameter Design of a Two-Current-Loop Controller Used in a Grid-Connected Inverter System With LCL Filter","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4909027","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Parameter Design of a Two-Current-Loop Controller Used in a Grid-Connected Inverter System With LCL Filter","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4909027/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 May 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"56","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","accessionNumber":"10909329","dateOfInsertion":"09 October 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4909027/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Parameter Design of a Two-Current-Loop Controller Used in a Grid-Connected Inverter System With LCL Filter","sourcePdf":"tie-liu-2021175.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.096001S","chronDate":"Nov.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"5282654","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"191","xplore-issue":"5282654","articleId":"4909027","onlineDate":"05 May 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4909035,"authors":[{"name":"Shao-Cheng Tong","affiliation":["Department of Basic Mathematics, Liaoning University of Technology, Jinzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/91/5272826/4909035/4909035-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Shao-Cheng Tong received the B.A. degree in mathematics from Jinzhou Normal College, Jinzhou, China, the M.A. degree in fuzzy mathematics from Dalian Marine University, Dalian, China, and the Ph.D. degree in fuzzy control from the Northeastern University, Shenyang, China, in 1982, 1988, and 1997, respectively.","He is currently a Professor with the Department of Basic Mathematics, Liaoning University of Technology, Jinzhou, China.

The nonlinear systems addressed in this paper are assumed to possess unmodeled dynamics in the presence of unstructured uncertainties and dynamic disturbances, where the unstructured uncertainties are not linearly parameterized, and no prior knowledge of their bounds are available. Fuzzy logic systems are used to approximate the unstructured uncertainties, and a state observer is developed to estimate the unmeasured states. By combining the backstepping technique with the small-gain approach, a stable adaptive fuzzy output feedback control method is proposed. It is shown that by applying the proposed adaptive fuzzy control approach, the closed-loop systems are semiglobally uniformly ultimately bounded.

The novel prior is also coupled with a dasiaharmonicpsila neighborhood, which apart from the immediately adjacent samples on the time frequency plane, also considers samples which are one pitch frequency apart, so as to take advantage of the rich structure of the voiced speech time frames. Additionally, central to the development of the algorithm is the adaptive estimation of the weights that determine the interaction between neighboring samples, which allows the restoration of weak speech spectral components, while maintaining a low level of uniform residual noise.

However, unlike wireless CDMA, high bit-rate optical CDMA networks use much higher bandwidth, which cannot be effectively processed with modern electronics rendering many earlier developed detection schemes inapplicable. In this paper we show both theoretically and experimentally that conventional electronics-based detection is inefficient in optical CDMA networks and limits the total network throughput by the bandwidth of the photodetector used. As a solution, we show that network performance can be greatly improved using ultrafast all-optical signal processing for signal detection. Recently developed all-optical thresholding devices performing cubic transformation allow for more than seven times increase in throughput for typical network parameters. A comprehensive comparison of different detection methods for optical CDMA including optimized electronics-based and all-optical signal processing-based is given for the first time.","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/50/5208445/04909056.pdf","startPage":"4069","endPage":"4075","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2009.2022193","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2009.2022193","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5208445","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4909056","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Ultrashort Optical Pulse Detection for High-Speed Asynchronous Optical CDMA Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optical pulses","Optical detectors","High speed optical techniques","Optical fiber networks","Multiaccess communication","Optical signal processing","Ultrafast optics","Bandwidth","Throughput","Scalability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bandwidth allocation","code division multiple access","optical fibre networks","photodetectors","signal detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ultrashort optical pulse detection","high-speed asynchronous bit-rate optical CDMA network","optical code-division multiple access","optical multiplexing scheme","quality of service","physical layer privacy","photodetector bandwidth","ultrafast all-optical signal processing","signal detection","all-optical thresholding device","cubic transformation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["All-optical thresholder","code-division multiple access","optical fiber communications","ultrashort optical pulse"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4909056/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.15,  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 May 2009","displayDocTitle":"Ultrashort Optical Pulse Detection for High-Speed Asynchronous Optical CDMA Networks","volume":"27","issue":"18","htmlLink":"/document/4909056/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept.15, 2009","accessionNumber":"10836776","dateOfInsertion":"18 August 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ultrashort Optical Pulse Detection for High-Speed Asynchronous Optical CDMA Networks","sourcePdf":"jlt-kkravtsov-2022193.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.08588S","chronDate":"Sept.15,  2009","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"5208445","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"5208445","articleId":"4909056","onlineDate":"05 May 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4909057,"authors":[{"name":"Chadwin D.

It provides a good basis for the implementation of the inverse problem in defect detection and the reconstruction of subsurface properties, which is beneficial for defect diagnosis. The objective of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of lower order models in the evaluation of bridge-deck subsurfaces modeled as layered media. The two lower order models considered are a 2-D model and a 2.5-D model that uses the 2-D geometry with a compressed coordinate system to capture wave behavior outside the cross-sectional plane. Both the 2- and 2.5-D models are compared to the results obtained from a full 3-D model. A filter that maps the 3-D excitation signal appropriately for 2- and 2.5-D simulations is presented. The 2.5-D model differs from the 2-D model in that it is capable of capturing 3-D wave behavior interacting with a 2-D geometry. The 2.5-D matches results from the corresponding 3-D model when there is no variation in the third dimension. Computational models for air-launched ground-penetrating radar with 1-GHz central frequency and bandwidth for the detection of bridge-deck delamination are implemented in 2-, 2.5-, and 3-D using FDTD simulations. In all cases, the defect is identifiable in the results. Thus, it is found that in layered media (such as bridge decks) 2- and 2.5-D models are good approximations for modeling bridge-deck deterioration, each with an order of magnitude reduction in computational time.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel5/36/5291960/04909071.pdf","startPage":"3656","endPage":"3663","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2009.2016846","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2009.2016846","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5291960","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4909071","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Effectiveness of 2-D and 2.5-D FDTD Ground-Penetrating Radar Modeling for Bridge-Deck Deterioration Evaluated by 3-D FDTD","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Finite difference methods","Time domain analysis","Ground penetrating radar","Solid modeling","Computational modeling","Bridges","Radar detection","Nonhomogeneous media","Geometry","Information analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bridges (structures)","concrete","finite difference time-domain analysis","geotechnical engineering","ground penetrating radar","wave propagation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["2D finite-difference time-domain","2.5D finite-difference time-domain","ground-penetrating radar modeling","bridge-deck deterioration","3D finite-difference time-domain","wave propagation","reinforced concrete bridge decks","sensor selection","inverse problem","subsurface properties reconstruction","bridge-deck subsurfaces model","layered media","capture wave behavior","cross-sectional plane","3D excitation signal","air-launched radar","bridge-deck delamination"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) methods","ground-penetrating radar (GPR)","nondestructive testing","road transportation","simulation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4909071/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 May 2009","displayDocTitle":"Effectiveness of 2-D and 2.5-D FDTD Ground-Penetrating Radar Modeling for Bridge-Deck Deterioration Evaluated by 3-D FDTD","volume":"47","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/4909071/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","accessionNumber":"10940718","dateOfInsertion":"23 October 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Effectiveness of 2-D and 2.5-D FDTD Ground-Penetrating Radar Modeling for Bridge-Deck Deterioration Evaluated by 3-D FDTD","sourcePdf":"tgrs-belli-2016846.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.065379S","chronDate":"Nov.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"5291960","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"5291960","articleId":"4909071","onlineDate":"05 May 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4909115,"authors":[{"name":"Ross Maciejewski","affiliation":["Electrical and computer engineering, Purdue University, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Ross Maciejewski is a PhD student in electrical and computer engineering at Purdue University.

Equalization techniques to compensate for linear transmission impairments are presented using the constant modulus algorithm (CMA), the recursive least-squares (RLS)-CMA, and the radius directed equalization (RDE). With 7 T/2-spaced taps, the RDE and the RLS-CMA can compensate up to 1000 ps/nm of CD in the 16-QAM coherent system with performances comparable to the decision-directed (DD) equalizer. We show that the RDE is a promising technique for blind equalization in a 16-QAM coherent system with lower complexity than the RLS-CMA. Blind carrier phase recovery is investigated in a decision-directed-mode. We show that the blind carrier phase recovery algorithm can recover the Square-16-QAM constellation for laser beat linewidths of DeltanuT\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">s</sub>\n ~ 10\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">-4</sup>\n in a polarization-multiplexed (POLMUX) 16-QAM coherent system with the RDE algorithm giving better overall performance than the CMA when compensating for CD and differential group delay (DGD).

With the developed fabrication process, propagation and bending loss of photonic wires were characterized. Measurements indicate a propagation loss of 2.7 dB/cm for 500-nm photonic wire and an excess bending loss of 0.013 dB/90deg bend of 5-mum radius.

The quality of transmitted voice is an important means of gauging performance of equipment and services related to voice communication. This paper shows how normal binary ordering in quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) can be used in an effective manner for voice transmission purposes in a soft radio to give better quality results. This would be compared to the M-ary Gray Coded Mapping Scheme which has proved so far a vital tool in error correction. These comparisons apply under some shortcomings like the use of same number of quantization levels i.e. M number of quantization levels for a signal being fed to an M-ary modulator, e.g. using 16 level quantization along with 16-QAM. The paper will review the comparison of the two coding schemes used in modulation techniques for voice signals. The relative and accuracy of the two techniques would also be discussed. It will be shown that for the above mentioned scenario (M quantization levels and M-ary QAM), the normal binary coded QAM performs better than Gray-coded QAM. This being done, a second scheme is proposed which performs much better than the previous.","doi":"10.1109/IC4.2009.4909156","publicationTitle":"2009 2nd International Conference on Computer, Control and Communication","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 2nd International Conference on Computer, Control and Communication","pdfPath":"/iel5/4850420/4909154/04909156.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IC4.2009.4909156","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4909154","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Effective normal binary ordering in QAM compared with Gray coded scheme for enhanced voice quality in software defined radios","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4909156","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Effective normal binary ordering in QAM compared with Gray coded scheme for enhanced voice quality in software defined radios","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-18 Feb. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4909156/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"17-18 Feb. 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2009","accessionNumber":"10626902","dateOfInsertion":"05 May 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4909156/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Effective normal binary ordering in QAM compared with Gray coded scheme for enhanced voice quality in software defined radios","confLoc":"Karachi, Pakistan","sourcePdf":"91_Saad.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058633S","chronDate":"17-18 Feb. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4850420","isNumber":"4909154","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4850420","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4909154","articleId":"4909156","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4909189,"authors":[{"name":"Muhammad Bilal Khalid","affiliation":["Telecommunications Engineering Department, MCS, National University of Sciences and Technology, Rawalpindi, Pakistan"],"firstName":"Muhammad Bilal","lastName":"Khalid","id":"38271423500"},{"name":"Naveed Iqbal Rao","affiliation":["Telecommunications Engineering Department, MCS, National University of Sciences and Technology, Rawalpindi, Pakistan"],"firstName":"Naveed Iqbal","lastName":"Rao","id":"37593731100"},{"name":"Intisar Rizwan-i-Haque","affiliation":["Telecommunications Engineering Department, MCS, National University of Sciences and Technology, Rawalpindi, Pakistan"],"firstName":"Intisar","lastName":"Rizwan-i-Haque","id":"38275236600"},{"name":"Sarmad Munir","affiliation":["Telecommunications Engineering Department, MCS, National University of Sciences and Technology, Rawalpindi, Pakistan"],"firstName":"Sarmad","lastName":"Munir","id":"38272888100"},{"name":"Farhan Tahir","affiliation":["Telecommunications Engineering Department, MCS, National University of Sciences and Technology, Rawalpindi, Pakistan"],"firstName":"Farhan","lastName":"Tahir","id":"38275021300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3313-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3314-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4909189","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":22,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":490},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Brain computer interfaces","Wavelet transforms","Biological neural networks","Control systems","Signal generators","Electroencephalography","Filters","Feature extraction","Decision making","Testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["brain-computer interfaces","decision making","electroencephalography","feature extraction","medical signal processing","radial basis function networks","signal classification","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["brain computer interface","wavelet transform","time segmented adapted wavelets","activity signals","electroencephalogram","time domain normalization","wavelet filter","feature extraction","radial basis neural networks","signals classification","heuristic weight adjustment","neural networks","final decision making"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Brain Computer Interface (BCI)","Wavelet transform","Pattern adapted wavelet"]}],"abstract":"A Brain Computer Interface (BCI) is a system that provides an individual a non-muscular way to control his surroundings by working on the activity signals generated in his brain.

It is also spectrally efficient since it does not utilize cyclic prefix (CP), nevertheless, it requires an efficient equalization technique to counter the inter symbol interference (ISI) and ICI created by the channel. In this paper, performance comparison of OFDM and WPM for several multipath wireless channels is presented. We propose a novel application of zero-forcing (ZF) and minimum mean square error (MMSE) algorithms as time-domain channel equalization techniques for WPM systems. It is shown that, for a multipath wireless channel, WPM using MMSE-equalizer has a better bit error rate (BER) performance as compared to ZF-equalizer in WPM, as well as OFDM system.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance comparison of Wavelet Packet Modulation and OFDM for multipath wireless channel","publicationTitle":"2009 2nd International Conference on Computer, Control and Communication","doi":"10.1109/IC4.2009.4909207","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 2nd International Conference on Computer, Control and Communication","pdfPath":"/iel5/4850420/4909154/04909207.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IC4.2009.4909207","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4909154","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4909207","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4909207/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-18 Feb. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Performance comparison of Wavelet Packet Modulation and OFDM for multipath wireless channel","conferenceDate":"17-18 Feb. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4909207/","dateOfInsertion":"05 May 2009","publicationDate":"Feb. 2009","accessionNumber":"10626950","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance comparison of Wavelet Packet Modulation and OFDM for multipath wireless channel","confLoc":"Karachi, Pakistan","sourcePdf":"32_Usman.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042028S","chronDate":"17-18 Feb. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4850420","isNumber":"4909154","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4850420","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"4909154","articleId":"4909207","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4909219,"authors":[{"name":"Nadeem Qazi","affiliation":["VisTek-ISRA Machine Vision, Istanbul, Turkey"],"firstName":"Nadeem","lastName":"Qazi","id":"37624273900"},{"name":"Hoi Yeung","affiliation":["Philips Research, Eindhoven, Netherlands"],"lastName":"Hoi Yeung","id":"37087945710"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3313-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3314-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4909219","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":272},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4909219","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Predictive models","Gravity","Particle separators","Petroleum","Gas industry","Natural gas","Economic forecasting","Lubricating oils","Filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["crude oil","cyclone separators","gas industry","multiphase flow","neural nets","petroleum industry","production engineering computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural network model","combined separation efficiency","compact axial cyclonic separator","gravity separator","denser phase removal","multiphase flow","oil industry","gas industry","crude oil","centrifugal separators","filter vane separators","mist eliminators","MLP neural network","compact gas liquid separator"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Gas liquid cyclone","separation efficiency","neural network","correlation coefficient"]}],"doi":"10.1109/IC4.2009.4909219","pdfPath":"/iel5/4850420/4909154/04909219.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 2nd International Conference on Computer, Control and Communication","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 2nd International Conference on Computer, Control and Communication","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4909154","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IC4.2009.4909219","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A neural network model predicting combined separation efficiency of compact axial cyclonic and gravity separator","abstract":"The removal of denser phase from the multiphase flow is one of fundamental and challenging task in oil and gas industry. It is because crude oil emerging from the well also contains natural gas, water and some time sand. Each of these needs to be separated out for economics reason before being transported to their destination. The available technology for multiphase separation includes gravity separators, centrifugal separators, filter vane separators and mist eliminators. However these separators are expensive in both operations and purchase. Compact or in line separators are one of suitable alternative because of their low cost, simplicity, easy handling and simple installation. The performance of such a newly designed gas liquid compact centrifugal separator is under study in the department of process and system engineering at Cranfield University UK. While several mechanistic models are available in literature for gravity separator, the neural network has not been used so far to predict the separation efficiency of the compact separator at least according to literature survey done by the author. This work describes an empirical model based on a variant of MLP neural network to predict the separation efficiency of a compact gas liquid separator. This model helps operator to effectively control the multiphase separator rig by predicting the separation efficiency at the changing operating inlet condition.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-18 Feb. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4909219/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10626962","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4909219/","publicationDate":"Feb. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"05 May 2009","conferenceDate":"17-18 Feb. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A neural network model predicting combined separation efficiency of compact axial cyclonic and gravity separator","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A neural network model predicting combined separation efficiency of compact axial cyclonic and gravity separator","confLoc":"Karachi, Pakistan","sourcePdf":"53_Nadeem.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040956S","chronDate":"17-18 Feb. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4850420","isNumber":"4909154","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4850420","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4909154","articleId":"4909219","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":4909226,"authors":[{"name":"Pengcheng Chen","affiliation":["College of Mathematical Sciences, Yangzhou University, Yangzhou, Jiangsu, China"],"lastName":"Pengcheng Chen","id":"37635235200"},{"name":"Yuansheng Tang","affiliation":["College of Mathematical Sciences, Yangzhou University, Yangzhou, Jiangsu, China"],"lastName":"Yuansheng Tang","id":"37403082900"},{"name":"Zhanghua Cao","affiliation":["College of Mathematical Sciences, Yangzhou University, Yangzhou, Jiangsu, China"],"lastName":"Zhanghua Cao","id":"37630519600"},{"name":"Tingsu Yan","affiliation":["College of Mathematical Sciences, Yangzhou University, Yangzhou, Jiangsu, China"],"lastName":"Tingsu Yan","id":"37642198700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3313-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3314-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4909226","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":113},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Parity check codes","Sufficient conditions","Educational institutions","AWGN channels","Sum product algorithm","Decoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["AWGN channels","cyclic codes","parity check codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["regular quasi-cyclic LDPC codes","cosets","AWGN channel"]}],"abstract":"We propose a construction method for constructing quasi-cyclic low-density parity-check (QC LDPC) codes based on subgroup's coset.

In addition, one of the main characteristics of multi-channel communications that can severely degrade the performance is the inconsistent and low values of SNR that result in high BER and poor channel capacity. It has been shown that the computational complexity of a multiuser receiver can be reduced by using the transformation matrix (TM) algorithm [4]. In this paper, we provide quantification of SNR based on the computational complexity of TM algorithm. We show that the reduction of complexity results high and consistent values of SNR that can consequently be used to achieve a desirable BER performance. In addition, our simulation results also suggest that the high and consistent values of SNR can be achieved for a desirable BER performance. The performance measure adopted in this paper is the consistent values of SNR.","doi":"10.1109/IC4.2009.4909237","publicationTitle":"2009 2nd International Conference on Computer, Control and Communication","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 2nd International Conference on Computer, Control and Communication","pdfPath":"/iel5/4850420/4909154/04909237.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IC4.2009.4909237","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4909154","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analyzing SNR performance of a low-complexity wireless Multiuser receiver for DS-CDMA systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4909237","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Analyzing SNR performance of a low-complexity wireless Multiuser receiver for DS-CDMA systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-18 Feb. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4909237/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"17-18 Feb. 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2009","accessionNumber":"10626980","dateOfInsertion":"05 May 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4909237/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analyzing SNR performance of a low-complexity wireless Multiuser receiver for DS-CDMA systems","confLoc":"Karachi, Pakistan","sourcePdf":"258_Syed.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039636S","chronDate":"17-18 Feb. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4850420","isNumber":"4909154","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4850420","xplore-issue":"4909154","articleId":"4909237","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4909239,"authors":[{"name":"Syed S.

Sinusoidal approximation approximates sinusoidal components of noisy vibration signals generated from gearboxes using autocorrelation of wavelet coefficients. First, the shortcomings of continuous wavelet transform have been ameliorated using autocorrelation function. Then, the autocorrelation of wavelet coefficients have been introduced as an original feature for monitoring purposes of gearbox diagnostics. Finally, a sinusoidal function has been further considered to approximate the periodic waveforms of autocorrelation coefficients for both normal and faulty gearboxes.

Sigma-Delta estimation is used to compute two orders of temporal statistics for each pixel of the sequence providing a pixel-level decision framework. A serious limitation of this approach lies in the adaptation capability to certain complex scenes. In this paper, we avoid this limitation by modeling each pixel as mixture of three distributions to deal with complex scenes. We show that the enhanced performance is achieved by using the proposed algorithm. This paper describes also an FPGA-based implementation of the proposed algorithm at a very high frame rate that reaches to 1198 frames per second in a single low cost FPGA chip, which is adequate for most real-time vision applications.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FPGA-based object-extraction based on multimodal \u03a3-\u0394 background estimation","doi":"10.1109/IC4.2009.4909253","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IC4.2009.4909253","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4909154","publicationTitle":"2009 2nd International Conference on Computer, Control and Communication","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 2nd International Conference on Computer, Control and Communication","pdfPath":"/iel5/4850420/4909154/04909253.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4909253","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4909253/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-18 Feb. 2009","displayDocTitle":"FPGA-based object-extraction based on multimodal \u03a3-\u0394 background estimation","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4909253/","dateOfInsertion":"05 May 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2009","accessionNumber":"10626995","conferenceDate":"17-18 Feb. 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FPGA-based object-extraction based on multimodal \u03a3-\u0394 background estimation","confLoc":"Karachi, Pakistan","sourcePdf":"191.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068467S","chronDate":"17-18 Feb. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4850420","isNumber":"4909154","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4850420","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4909154","articleId":"4909253","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4909259,"authors":[{"name":"Mohammad Asadi","affiliation":["Islamic Azad University, Science and Research Campus, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Mohammad","lastName":"Asadi","id":"37089111605"},{"name":"Farbod Razzazi","affiliation":["Islamic Azad University, Science and Research Campus, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Farbod","lastName":"Razzazi","id":"37396056100"},{"name":"Mehdi Asadi","affiliation":["Islamic Azad University, Science and Research Campus, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Mehdi","lastName":"Asadi","id":"38123886100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3313-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3314-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4909259","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":59},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4909259","abstract":"In this paper, an evolutionary method has been proposed for online obtaining the free parameters of generalized orthonormal IIR (GO-IIR) filters and its special case, Laguerre filters.

We focus on high spectral efficiency bit interleaved coded modulation (BICM) MIMO OFDM system where, after serial to parallel conversion and per antenna coding, spatial data streams are simultaneously transmitted by using an antenna array. We propose a detection algorithm basing on the combination of linear and non linear detection techniques. The proposed algorithm orders the spatial streams as per V-BLAST ordering and then uses linear detectors as MMSE or zero forcing (ZF) to detect the streams which have seen good channel realizations and therefore enjoy higher signal-to-noise-ratios (SNRs). These streams after being detected are subsequently stripped off leading to the max log MAP detection of the streams which have seen comparatively poor realizations of the channel and consequently have lower SNRs. Unlike maximum likelihood (ML) detection, whose complexity is huge due to the need for enumerating all possible combinations of the transmitted constellation points, the proposed method has low complexity. The algorithm has a fully parallel structure, suitable for the implementation in parallel hardware. Numerical examples illustrate its performance on slow fading 3 times 3 and 4 times 4 complex MIMO channels.","doi":"10.1109/IC4.2009.4909263","publicationTitle":"2009 2nd International Conference on Computer, Control and Communication","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 2nd International Conference on Computer, Control and Communication","pdfPath":"/iel5/4850420/4909154/04909263.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IC4.2009.4909263","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4909154","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reduced complexity soft detection for BICM MIMO OFDM system","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4909263","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-18 Feb. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4909263/","displayDocTitle":"Reduced complexity soft detection for BICM MIMO OFDM system","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2009","accessionNumber":"10627003","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4909263/","conferenceDate":"17-18 Feb. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"05 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reduced complexity soft detection for BICM MIMO OFDM system","confLoc":"Karachi, Pakistan","sourcePdf":"177_Rizwan.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044581S","chronDate":"17-18 Feb. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4850420","isNumber":"4909154","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4850420","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4909154","articleId":"4909263","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4909276,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaodong Lin","affiliation":["Faculty of Business and Information Technology, University of Ontario Institute of Technology (UOIT), Oshawa, ONT, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/4909272/4909276/4909276-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Xiaodong Lin (S'07-M'09) received the Ph.D. degree in information engineering from Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China, in 1998 and the Ph.D. degree (with Outstanding Achievement in Graduate Studies Award) in electrical and computer engineering from the University of Waterloo, Waterloo, ON, Canada, in 2008.

The wearable sensor system, built into a fabric belt, consists of various medical sensors that collect a timely set of physiological health indicators transmitted via low energy wireless communication to mobile computing devices. Three application scenarios are implemented using the proposed network architecture. The group-based data collection and data transmission using the ad hoc mode promote outpatient healthcare services for only one medical staff member assigned to a set of patients.

Congestion affects the continuous flow of data, loss of information, delay in the arrival of data to the destination and unwanted consumption of significant amount of the very limited amount of energy in the nodes. Obviously, in healthcare WSN applications, particularly in the ones that cater to medical emergencies or in the ones that closely monitor critically ailing patients, it is desirable in the first place to avoid congestion from occurring and even if it occurs, to reduce the loss of data due to congestion. In this work, we address the problem of congestion in the nodes of healthcare WSN using a learning automata (LA)-based approach. Our primary objective in using this approach is to adaptively make the processing rate (data packet arrival rate) in the nodes equal to the transmitting rate (packet service rate), so that the occurrence of congestion in the nodes is seamlessly avoided. We maintain that the proposed algorithm, named as learning automata-based congestion avoidance algorithm in sensor networks (LACAS), can counter the congestion problem in healthcare WSNs effectively. An important feature of LACAS is that it intelligently' learns' from the past and improves its performance significantly as time progresses. Our proposed LA based model was evaluated using simulations representing healthcare WSNs. The results obtained through the experiments with respect to performance criteria having important implications in the healthcare domain, for example, the number of collisions, the energy consumption at the nodes, the network throughput, the number of unicast packets delivered, the number of packets delivered to each node, the signals received and forwarded to the medium access control (MAC) layer, and the change in energy consumption with variation in transmission range, have shown that the proposed algorithm is capable of successfully avoiding congestion in typical healthcare WSNs requiring a reliable congestion control mechanism.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4909284/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 May 2009","volume":"27","issue":"4","accessionNumber":"10628479","publicationDate":"May 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4909284/","dateOfInsertion":"05 May 2009","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Lacas: learning automata-based congestion avoidance scheme for healthcare wireless sensor networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Lacas: learning automata-based congestion avoidance scheme for healthcare wireless sensor networks","sourcePdf":"466jsac0409obaidat.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.090587S","chronDate":"May  2009","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"4909272","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"129","xplore-issue":"4909272","articleId":"4909284","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-11"},{"_id":4909285,"authors":[{"name":"Tarik Taleb","affiliation":["Graduate School of Information Sciences, University of Tohoku, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/4909272/4909285/4909285-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Tarik Taleb is currently working as assistant professor at the Graduate School of Information Sciences' Tohoku University, Japan.

In fact, partial and progressive loss of motor, sensorial, and/or cognitive skills renders elders unable to live autonomously, eventually leading to their hospitalization. This results in both relevant emotional and economic costs. Ubiquitous computing technologies can offer interesting opportunities for in-house safety and autonomy. However, existing systems partially address in-house safety requirements and typically focus on only elder monitoring and emergency detection. The paper presents ANGELAH, a middleware-level solution integrating both \"elder monitoring and emergency detection\" solutions and networking solutions. ANGELAH has two main features: i) it enables efficient integration between a variety of sensors and actuators deployed at home for emergency detection and ii) provides a solid framework for creating and managing rescue teams composed of individuals willing to promptly assist elders in case of emergency situations. A prototype of ANGELAH, designed for a case study for helping elders with vision impairments, is developed and interesting results are obtained from both computer simulations and a real-network testbed.","pdfPath":"/iel5/49/4909272/04909285.pdf","startPage":"480","endPage":"494","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4909272","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2009.090511","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2009.090511","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4909285","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Safety","Monitoring","Senior citizens","Stress","Costs","Ubiquitous computing","Sensor phenomena and characterization","Actuators","Solids","Disaster management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["emergency services","handicapped aids","middleware","patient monitoring","ubiquitous computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ANGELAH","elderly people","welfare systems","cognitive skills","hospitalization","ubiquitous computing","in-house safety","elder monitoring","emergency detection","middleware"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Ubiquitous assistance, pervasive computing, healthcare network, and elderly assistance"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4909285/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 May 2009","displayDocTitle":"Angelah: a framework for assisting elders at home","accessionNumber":"10628480","dateOfInsertion":"05 May 2009","publicationDate":"May 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4909285/","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"27","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Angelah: a framework for assisting elders at home","sourcePdf":"480jsac0409taleb.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.094074S","chronDate":"May  2009","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"4909272","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"51","xplore-issue":"4909272","articleId":"4909285","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":4909286,"authors":[{"name":"Naixue Xiong","affiliation":["School of Information Science, Japan Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Japan","Department of Computer Science, Georgia State University, Atlanta, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/4909272/4909286/4909286-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Naixue Xiong is a research scientist in Department of Computer Science, Georgia State University, USA.

FD can be used to manage the health status of communication for delivering telemedicine services, and then to help distributed healthcare system reduce fatal accident rate and increase the reliability and safety of systems. Ensuring acceptable quality of service (QoS) is made difficult by the relative unpredictability of the network environment. In this paper, first, we compare QoS metrics of several adaptive FDs, discuss their properties and their relation, and then propose one optimization over the existing methods, called tuning adaptive margin failure detector (TAM FD), which significantly improves QoS, especially in the aggressive range and when the network is unstable. Second, we address the problem of most adaptive schemes, namely their need for a large window of samples. So we also analyze the impact of memory size on the performance of FDs, and then prove that the presented scheme is designed to use a fixed and very limited amount of memory for the distributed system. Our experimental results over several kinds of networks (Cluster, WiFi, LAN, Intercontinental WAN) show that the properties of the existing adaptive failure detectors, and demonstrate that the optimization is reasonable and acceptable. Furthermore, the extensive experimental results show what is the effect of memory size on the overall QoS of each adaptive failure detector. For our TAM FD, the effect of window size on their QoS is very small and can be negligible.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4909272","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/49/4909272/04909286.pdf","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2009.090512","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2009.090512","startPage":"495","endPage":"509","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Comparative analysis of quality of service and memory usage for adaptive failure detectors in healthcare systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 May 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4909286/","displayDocTitle":"Comparative analysis of quality of service and memory usage for adaptive failure detectors in healthcare systems","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4909286/","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"27","issue":"4","accessionNumber":"10628481","dateOfInsertion":"05 May 2009","publicationDate":"May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparative analysis of quality of service and memory usage for adaptive failure detectors in healthcare systems","sourcePdf":"495jsac0409vasilakos.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.164522S","chronDate":"May  2009","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"4909272","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"143","xplore-issue":"4909272","articleId":"4909286","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-09"},{"_id":4909401,"authors":[{"name":"B.

The proposed method indirectly generates the compensation current reference by using an equivalent conductance of the fundamental component using APF's dc-link voltage control. The proposed control can selectively choose harmonic current components by real-time fast Fourier transform to generate the compensation current. The compensation current is represented in a rotating coordinate system with chosen switching states from a switching table implemented in a field-programmable gate array. In addition, a three-phase four-wire APF based on a three-level neutral-point-clamped inverter is also presented. The proposed APF eliminates harmonics in all three phases as well as the neutral current. A three-phase three-wire NPC inverter system can be used as a three-phase four-wire system since the split dc capacitors provide a neutral connection. To regulate and balance the split dc-capacitor voltages, a new control method using a sign cubical hysteresis controller is proposed.

This paper proposes a control scheme for rotating and levitating a 12/8 BSRM. The motor average torque and radial force are independently controlled with hybrid excitations in main windings and levitation windings. First, the mathematical relationship between radial force and currents, which is utilized in this paper, is derived by using the Maxwell stress tensor method. Then, the proposed control scheme is analyzed. The average torque of each phase generated in the levitation region equals zero for its symmetry of the aligned position. Accordingly, the current calculating algorithm is deduced to minimize the magnitude of instantaneous torque in the levitation region. The principle and realization of the proposed scheme are demonstrated with finite-element (FE) analysis. Experimental results show that the proposed scheme is effective for a stable levitation.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Force control","Torque control","Reluctance motors","Levitation","Reluctance machines","Stator windings","Rotors","Magnetic forces","Shafts","Stress"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["finite element analysis","force control","machine control","machine windings","magnetic levitation","reluctance motors","torque control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bearingless switched-reluctance motors","machine levitation","levitation windings","Maxwell stress tensor method","finite-element analysis","average torque control","radial force control","hybrid excitations"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Bearingless motor","independent control","radial force","switched-reluctance motor (SRM)","torque"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4815917","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2009.2016568","startPage":"1376","endPage":"1385","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/63/4815917/04909409.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2009.2016568","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Independent Control of Average Torque and Radial Force in Bearingless Switched-Reluctance Motors With Hybrid Excitations","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 May 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Independent Control of Average Torque and Radial Force in Bearingless Switched-Reluctance Motors With Hybrid Excitations","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10681794","publicationDate":"May 2009","volume":"24","issue":"5","dateOfInsertion":"05 May 2009","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4909409/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4909409/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Independent Control of Average Torque and Radial Force in Bearingless Switched-Reluctance Motors With Hybrid Excitations","sourcePdf":"tpel-cao-2016568.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.051043S","chronDate":"May  2009","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"4815917","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"78","xplore-issue":"4815917","articleId":"4909409","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4909426,"authors":[{"name":"Colin Gilmore","affiliation":["Schlumberger-Doll Research Center, Cambridge, MA, USA","Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, MAN, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8/4909425/4909426/4909426-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Colin Gilmore (S'05) received the B.Sc. and the M.Sc. degrees in electrical engineering from the University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, MB, Canada, in 2002 and 2005, respectively, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering.","During 2008, he completed an internship at Schlumberger-Doll Research, Cambridge, MA.

The algorithm is capable of inverting complex-permittivity biomedical data sets without the explicit use of a forward solver at each iteration. The FD solver is based in the frequency domain, utilizes perfectly matched layer (PML) boundary conditions, and the stiffness matrix is solved via an LU decomposition and Gaussian elimination. An important feature of the FD-CSI algorithm is that the stiffness matrix associated with the FD solver depends only upon the background medium and frequency, and thus the LU decomposition is only performed once, before the iterative inversion process. Unlike the usual integral equation (IE) based inversion techniques, the FD-CSI algorithm is readily capable of utilizing an arbitrary backarbitrary backgroundground medium for the inversion process.","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2009.2016728","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8/4909425/04909426.pdf","startPage":"1528","endPage":"1538","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2009.2016728","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4909425","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Microwave Biomedical Data Inversion Using the Finite-Difference Contrast Source Inversion Method","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4909426","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 May 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4909426/","displayDocTitle":"Microwave Biomedical Data Inversion Using the Finite-Difference Contrast Source Inversion Method","volume":"57","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10628526","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4909426/","dateOfInsertion":"05 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Microwave Biomedical Data Inversion Using the Finite-Difference Contrast Source Inversion Method","sourcePdf":"tap-abubakar-2016728.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.094795S","chronDate":"May  2009","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"4909425","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"74","xplore-issue":"4909425","articleId":"4909426","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4909430,"authors":[{"name":"Milan M.

The geometry of the structure is modeled using generalized curved parametric hexahedral and quadrilateral elements of arbitrary geometrical orders. The fields and currents on elements are modeled using curl- and divergence-conforming hierarchical polynomial vector basis functions of arbitrary approximation orders, and the Galerkin method is used for testing. The elements can be as large as about two wavelengths in each dimension. As multiple MoM objects are possible in a global exterior region, the MoM part provides much greater modeling versatility and potential for applications, especially in antenna problems, than just as a boundary-integral closure to the FEM part. The examples demonstrate excellent accuracy, convergence, efficiency, and versatility of the new FEM-MoM technique, and very effective large-domain meshes that consist of a very small number of large flat and curved FEM and MoM elements, with \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">p</i>\n-refined field and current distributions of high approximation orders.

The proposed PIFA has a simple structure of comprising two radiating strips of length about lambda/8 at 900 MHz and is fed using a coupling feed. Compared to the traditional PIFA using a direct feed, the coupling feed greatly decreases the very large input impedance seen at the lambda/8 mode for the traditional PIFA and results in successful excitation of the lambda/8 mode for the proposed PIFA. Two lambda/8 modes are generated by the two radiating strips and occur at close frequencies at about 900 MHz to form a wide lower band to cover GSM850/900 operation. The two radiating strips also generate two higher-order modes or lambda/4 modes at about 1900 MHz to form a wide upper band for GSM1800/1900/UMTS operation.

A multilevel extension, inspired by the multilevel fast multipole method, is presented that is suitable for the efficient transformation of electrically large antennas with a size of tens or even hundreds of wavelengths. The measurement points are grouped in a multilevel fashion and translations are carried out to the box centers on the highest level only. The plane waves are processed through the different levels to the measurement points using a disaggregation and anterpolation procedure resulting in a reduced overall complexity. In the second part of this paper, the influence of perfectly conducting ground planes and dielectric halfspaces, as an approximation for ground effects in a real measurement setup, is investigated. As such ground reflected waves are assumed, which propagate from the investigated antenna to the field probe and add to the direct wave contributions. The far-field conditions required for these assumptions are achieved by a source box grouping scheme. By this extension ground effects are directly considered within the near-field far-field transformation. Transformation results using simulated and measured near-field data are shown. </para>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4909439/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 May 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4909439/","dateOfInsertion":"05 May 2009","publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10645289","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"57","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Multilevel Plane Wave Based Near-Field Far-Field Transformation for Electrically Large Antennas in Free-Space or Above Material Halfspace","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multilevel Plane Wave Based Near-Field Far-Field Transformation for Electrically Large Antennas in Free-Space or Above Material Halfspace","sourcePdf":"tap-schmidt-2016699.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.048475S","chronDate":"May  2009","isNumber":"4909425","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"49","articleId":"4909439","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-23"},{"_id":4909444,"authors":[{"name":"Jorge R.

The method incorporates the benefits of NNs and SBSs to achieve DoA estimation in a less complex and expensive way compared to the corresponding widely known super resolution algorithms. The proposed technique is step-by-step developed and thoroughly studied and explained, especially in terms of the beam pattern structure and the neuro-computational procedures. Emphasis is given on the direct sequence code division multiple access (DS-CDMA) applications, and particularly the Universal Mobile Telecommunication System (UMTS). Extensive simulations are realized for each step of the method, demonstrating its performance. It is shown that a properly trained NN can accurately find the signal of interest (SoI) angle of arrival at the presence of a varying number of mobile users and a varying SoI to interference ratio. The proposed NN-SBS DoA estimation method can be applied to current cellular communications base stations, promoting the wider use of smart antenna beamforming.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2009.2016721","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4909425","startPage":"1399","endPage":"1411","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8/4909425/04909445.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Direction of Arrival (DoA) Estimation for a Switched-Beam Antenna System Using Neural Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4909445/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 May 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4909445/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"On the Direction of Arrival (DoA) Estimation for a Switched-Beam Antenna System Using Neural Networks","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10628536","dateOfInsertion":"05 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"57","issue":"5","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Direction of Arrival (DoA) Estimation for a Switched-Beam Antenna System Using Neural Networks","sourcePdf":"tap-gotsis-2016721.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.079566S","chronDate":"May  2009","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"4909425","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"56","xplore-issue":"4909425","articleId":"4909445","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4909447,"authors":[{"name":"Laila K.

ADG is presented as a preferred alternative to apparent diversity gain and effective diversity gain. Absorption due to user proximity causes degradation and imbalance in mean effective gain of the antennas over the frequency bands, contributing to a degradation in diversity performance. However, user-induced changes in the antenna patterns cause a decrease in correlation in the low frequency band, which facilitates increased diversity gain. The study reveals that a significant net diversity gain, i.e., ADG of 5-8 dB compared to a single antenna prototype, can be achieved using multiband antennas in the proximity of a user, even at low frequencies for antennas with high mutual coupling.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Actual Diversity Performance of a Multiband Diversity Antenna With Hand and Head Effects","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2009.2016707","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8/4909425/04909459.pdf","startPage":"1547","endPage":"1556","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2009.2016707","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4909425","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4909459","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4909459/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 May 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2009","displayDocTitle":"Actual Diversity Performance of a Multiband Diversity Antenna With Hand and Head Effects","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"57","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/4909459/","dateOfInsertion":"05 May 2009","publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10628519","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Actual Diversity Performance of a Multiband Diversity Antenna With Hand and Head Effects","sourcePdf":"tap-plicanic-2016707.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.162045S","chronDate":"May  2009","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"4909425","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"76","xplore-issue":"4909425","articleId":"4909459","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4909462,"authors":[{"name":"Feng Xu","affiliation":["National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Environmental Satellite Data and Information Service (NESDIS), Camp Springs, MD, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8/4909425/4909462/4909462-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Feng Xu (M'08) received the B.S. degree from Southeast University, Nanjing, China in 2003 and the Ph.D. degree from Fudan University, Shanghai, China, in 2007.","He is currently a Postdoctoral Researcher at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)/National Environmental Satellite Data and Information Service (NESDIS), Camp Spring, MD.

Ray tracing is carried out both along the incident (forward) direction and converse direction of scattering (backward) recording different orders of ray illumination on each facet or edge of the target and surface. Once a pair of forward and backward rays meet on a facet/edge, a scattering term is constructed using the diffused scattering/diffraction of this facet/edge and all reflections occurred on the tracing paths. The rough surface is modeled with ldquorough facetsrdquo including coherent scattering and diffused incoherent scattering, which can be directly calculated according to the IEM (integral equation method) of a randomly rough surface. Analytic tracing of polygon ray tubes is developed to precisely calculate the illumination and shadowing of facets, which exempt large patches of the target from any finer meshing. It significantly reduces the complexity relevant to the target electric-size. Higher orders of scattering and, in particular, interactions between the target and rough surface are then taken into account. The accuracy and performance of BART is validated and evaluated by comparing with exact computational electromagnetic methods for electrically small targets. Numerical examples of angularly composite scattering from a three-dimensional electrically large, e.g., a ship-like target over a randomly rough surface are presented and discussed.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bidirectional Analytic Ray Tracing for Fast Computation of Composite Scattering From Electric-Large Target Over a Randomly Rough Surface","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2009.2016691","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8/4909425/04909462.pdf","startPage":"1495","endPage":"1505","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2009.2016691","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4909425","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4909462","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4909462/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 May 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2009","displayDocTitle":"Bidirectional Analytic Ray Tracing for Fast Computation of Composite Scattering From Electric-Large Target Over a Randomly Rough Surface","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"57","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/4909462/","dateOfInsertion":"05 May 2009","publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10628522","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bidirectional Analytic Ray Tracing for Fast Computation of Composite Scattering From Electric-Large Target Over a Randomly Rough Surface","sourcePdf":"tap-jin-2016691.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.100832S","chronDate":"May  2009","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"4909425","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"88","xplore-issue":"4909425","articleId":"4909462","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4909463,"authors":[{"name":"Young-Bae Jung","affiliation":["Korean Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, South Korea","Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute, Daejeon, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8/4909425/4909463/4909463-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Young-Bae Jung was born in Seoul, Korea.

Subsequently, the near-field-region and the Fresnel-region fields of this lens antenna are measured by the planar-near-field (PNF) method.

Both the central processing unit (CPU) time and memory requirement can be reduced efficiently. Finally, the effects of several fundamental issues, including spatial sample parameters, lens material, operating frequency, and designed focal length, on the accuracy of the proposed scheme and on the focusing properties of the lens are investigated.","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2009.2016719","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8/4909425/04909465.pdf","startPage":"1442","endPage":"1451","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2009.2016719","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4909425","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FDTD-PWS Scheme and Its Application to Analysis of Focusing Properties of Dielectric Lens","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4909465","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 May 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4909465/","displayDocTitle":"FDTD-PWS Scheme and Its Application to Analysis of Focusing Properties of Dielectric Lens","volume":"57","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10628524","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4909465/","dateOfInsertion":"05 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FDTD-PWS Scheme and Its Application to Analysis of Focusing Properties of Dielectric Lens","sourcePdf":"tap-zhang-2016719.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.084944S","chronDate":"May  2009","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"4909425","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4909425","articleId":"4909465","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4909475,"authors":[{"name":"Homin Kwon","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Homin Kwon (S'06) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electronic engineering from Dong-A University, Busan, Korea, in 2002 and 2004, respectively.","He is a Doctoral student in electrical engineering at Arizona State University, Tempe.

The introduction of hardware wireless sensors in a signal processing education setting can serve as a paradigm for data acquisition, collaborative signal processing, or simply as a platform for obtaining, processing, and analyzing real-life real-time data. In this paper, a software interface that enables the Java-digital signal processing (J-DSP) visual programming environment to communicate in a two-way manner with a wireless sensor network is presented. This interface was developed by writing nesC (an extension to the C programming language for sensors) code that enables J-DSP to issue commands to multiple wireless sensor motes, activate specific transducers, and analyze data using any of the existing J-DSP signal processing functions in real time. A series of exercises were developed and disseminated to provide hardware experiences to signals and systems and signal processing undergraduate students. The hardware with the J-DSP software has been used for two semesters in the senior level digital signal processing (DSP) course at Arizona State University. The interface, the exercises, and their assessment (instruments and results) are described in the paper.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Experiments With Sensor Motes and Java-DSP","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Education","doi":"10.1109/TE.2008.927691","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Education","pdfPath":"/iel5/13/4909467/04909475.pdf","startPage":"257","endPage":"262","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TE.2008.927691","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4909467","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4909475","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4909475/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 May 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2009","displayDocTitle":"Experiments With Sensor Motes and Java-DSP","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"52","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/4909475/","dateOfInsertion":"05 May 2009","publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10628381","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Experiments With Sensor Motes and Java-DSP","sourcePdf":"52te02-kwon.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.22803S","chronDate":"May  2009","xplore-pub-id":"13","isNumber":"4909467","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"13","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"4909467","articleId":"4909475","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4909477,"authors":[{"name":"Luisa M.

Many of these efforts have been directed to collaborative scenarios used in remote, blended or face-to-face experiences, in order to take advantage of the flexibility provided by ICT. However competitive learning could also have some positive effects on the success of the learning process, to be added to those of collaborative virtual environments. This paper explores the effects of competitive learning on the satisfaction and the academic achievement of telecommunications students. A tool for active and competitive learning (called QUEST) has been used in the \u201cCommunications Networks\u201d undergraduate course. Significant results on the use of competitive e-learning tools in university students' outcomes and satisfaction are presented. </para>","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4909477/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 May 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4909477/","dateOfInsertion":"05 May 2009","publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10628382","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"52","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Effects of Competitive E-Learning Tools on Higher Education Students: A Case Study","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Effects of Competitive E-Learning Tools on Higher Education Students: A Case Study","sourcePdf":"52te02-regueras.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.068234S","chronDate":"May  2009","xplore-pub-id":"13","isNumber":"4909467","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"13","citationCount":"60","xplore-issue":"4909467","articleId":"4909477","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4909517,"authors":[{"name":"Andrew J.
