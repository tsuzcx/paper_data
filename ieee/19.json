In many respects, MUSHROOM resembles the mass of RISC architectures now dominating the 32-bit processor market. The ability to reconfigure nearly instantaneously is clearly a major advantage of LCA devices over UV erasable or fuse programmable devices. By loading different configuration patterns, the same hardware can, for example, be readily used to implement many different versions of the processor architecture. Although dynamic re-configuration is useful in this respect, it is less useful in correcting errors as the time required for re-placement and re-routing can be substantial. For programmable devices, the logic density and IO connectivity of LCAs are unsurpassed. However, the matrix structure and programmable interconnect can lead to widely varying signal timings depending on the routing. Consequently, great care must be taken to eliminate long paths on critical signals. In contrast, the signal timings in the PAL style of programmable devices are much easier to determine and manage.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEE Colloquium on Programmable Logic Devices for Digital Systems Implementation","pdfPath":"/iel3/1850/4828/00190243.pdf","startPage":"5/1","endPage":"5/3","publicationTitle":"IEE Colloquium on Programmable Logic Devices for Digital Systems Implementation","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4828","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=190243","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Programmable logic arrays for prototype computer implementation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Logic arrays","Design automation","Reduced instruction set computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["logic arrays","logic CAD","reduced instruction set computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["PLA","programmable logic arrays","logic cell arrays","prototype computer implementation","prototyping","MUSHROOM","RISC processor","Smalltalk-80","Lisp","RISC architectures","32-bit processor","LCA devices","logic density","IO connectivity","matrix structure","programmable interconnect","varying signal timings"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IET","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/190243/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25 May 1990","displayDocTitle":"Programmable logic arrays for prototype computer implementation","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1990","accessionNumber":"3720298","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"25-25 May 1990","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Programmable logic arrays for prototype computer implementation","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"00190243.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.032312S","chronDate":"25 May 1990","isNumber":"4828","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1850","citationCount":"3","articleId":"190243","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":190427,"authors":[{"name":"M.

There are many reasons why one needs such techniques for the automated improvement of integrated circuits. In the most familiar case the designer may have done the best he or she can, and produced a circuit which meets specifications, but wishes to discover whether any improvement is possible via the adjustment of parameter values. Or a circuit may have been passed to a layout module and the extracted parasitics added to the circuit model to produce what is, in effect, a new circuit which must be readjusted to satisfy the specifications. Alternately, within one of the emerging analogue synthesis systems, some simple design rules may have been used to automatically generate a 'first cut' circuit design which then needs to be adjusted to bring it closer to the desired performance. Further adjustment may also be needed, in a procedure called tolerance design, to compensate for the reduction in manufacturing yield which might occur due to the inevitable tolerances on component values.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","publicationTitle":"IEE Colloquium on Analogue IC Design: Obstacles and Opportunities","displayPublicationTitle":"IEE Colloquium on Analogue IC Design: Obstacles and Opportunities","pdfPath":"/iel3/1834/4842/00190427.pdf","startPage":"4/1","endPage":"4/5","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4842","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The automated improvement of analogue integrated circuits","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IET","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/190427/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18 Jun 1990","displayDocTitle":"The automated improvement of analogue integrated circuits","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1990","accessionNumber":"3720360","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"18-18 June 1990","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The automated improvement of analogue integrated circuits","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"00190427.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068418S","chronDate":"18 Jun 1990","isNumber":"4842","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1834","citationCount":"1","articleId":"190427","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":190448,"authors":[{"name":"A.C.

This is especially true for radiowave propagation into side roads and roads parallel to the main coverage area where line-of-sight paths do not normally exist. Field experiments have shown that at 900 MHz the signal level drops by 20 dB when a mobile unit turned into a side road. The author explains the mechanism of radiowave propagation in typical city microcell environments. With this knowledge, the observed signal variation can be characterised by either using a relatively complex model based on geometrical optics and the geometrical theory of diffraction or a simple model based on piecewise linear regression. The former modelling approach enables more accurate prediction of the signal levels especially along side roads, while the latter reduces computation significantly and is more suitable for large scale cellular radio system performance simulations.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","publicationTitle":"IEE Colloquium on Diffraction Propagation Modelling Techniques Embracing Surface Feature Data","displayPublicationTitle":"IEE Colloquium on Diffraction Propagation Modelling Techniques Embracing Surface Feature Data","pdfPath":"/iel3/1791/4874/00190845.pdf","startPage":"3/1","endPage":"3/5","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4874","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modelling for radiowave propagation in city microcells","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IET","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/190845/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16 Nov 1990","displayDocTitle":"Modelling for radiowave propagation in city microcells","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1990","accessionNumber":"3833847","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"16-16 Nov. 1990","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modelling for radiowave propagation in city microcells","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"00190845.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.020262S","chronDate":"16 Nov 1990","isNumber":"4874","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1791","citationCount":"13","articleId":"190845","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":190875,"authors":[{"name":"A.D.

Two examples-a 256 kb SRAM and reconfigurable 32*32 port 32 b crossbar switch-are presented to illustrate the essential characteristics of the proposed yield estimation method.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/4.192046","startPage":"146","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel1/4/4948/00192046.pdf","endPage":"156","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4948","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/4.192046","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1993","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/192046/","displayDocTitle":"Accurate estimation of defect-related yield loss in reconfigurable VLSI circuits","volume":"28","issue":"2","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4384028","publicationDate":"Feb. 1993","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Accurate estimation of defect-related yield loss in reconfigurable VLSI circuits","sourcePdf":"00192046.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.059382S","chronDate":"Feb 1993","isNumber":"4948","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"39","articleId":"192046","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":192049,"authors":[{"name":"Jien Chung Lo","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Rhode Island, Kingston, RI, USA"],"lastName":"Jien Chung Lo","id":"37273260100"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9200"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-173X"}],"articleNumber":"192049","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":37,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":510},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Solid-State Circuits Society","url":"http://ewh.ieee.org/soc/sscs/index.php"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=192049","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Circuit faults","Fault detection","Built-in self-test","Delay effects","Circuit simulation","Bridge circuits","Error correction","Digital systems","Logic circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS integrated circuits","comparators (circuits)","error detection","integrated logic circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["stuck-at faults","stuck-open faults","stuck-on faults","static CMOS","totally self-checking comparator","concurrent error detection","bridging faults"]}],"abstract":"The comparator is an essential element in concurrent error detection (CED).

A mathematical tool derived through robust estimation theory, order statistics has allowed engineers to develop nonlinear filters with excellent robustness properties. These filters are well suited to digital image processing because they preserve the edges and the fine details of an image much better than conventional linear filters. The probabilistic and deterministic properties of the best known and most widely used filter in this family, the median filter, are discussed. In addition, the authors consider filters that, while not based on order statistics, are related to them through robust estimation theory. A table that ranks nonlinear filters under a variety of performance criteria is included. Most of the topics treated are very active research areas, and the applications are varied, including HDTV, multichannel signal processing of geophysical and ECG/EEG data, and a variety of telecommunications applications.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/192071/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1992","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1992","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"80","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4380998","displayDocTitle":"Order statistics in digital image processing","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Order statistics in digital image processing","sourcePdf":"00192071.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.182304S","chronDate":"Dec.  1992","isNumber":"4949","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"331","articleId":"192071","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":192074,"authors":[{"name":"P.

The design of higher order dominant mode circular microstrip antennas is addressed, with an example and measurements for the n=3 case. Measurements for the n=3 modes show reasonable agreement with theory in the forms of the impedance loci, but the frequency dependence is in error by the order of the bandwidth of the antenna. A design example is given for a roof-mounted circular patch for vehicular communications. The example indicates that an n=3 dominant mode patch can be used as a two-port antenna for diversity applications or with a 90 degrees phase shifter and adder as a single-port antenna for omnidirectional coverage with (essentially) circular polarization.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Two-port higher mode circular microstrip antennas","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/8.192112","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel4/8/4951/00192112.pdf","startPage":"309","endPage":"321","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/8.192112","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4951","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=192112","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/192112/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1988","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1988","displayDocTitle":"Two-port higher mode circular microstrip antennas","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"36","issue":"3","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"March 1988","accessionNumber":"3232419","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Two-port higher mode circular microstrip antennas","sourcePdf":"00192112.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.025272S","chronDate":"Mar 1988","isNumber":"4951","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"64","articleId":"192112","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1988","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":192116,"authors":[{"name":"J.E.

To avoid adaptive estimation of the eigenstructure, the eigenstructure of an averaged correlation matrix (which spans the interference scenarios of interest) is utilized, and the adaptive dimension is given by the rank of the averaged correlation matrix.

To accomplish this task with reasonably few degrees of freedom (DOF) from the large aperture, the system uses interferometer/sparse array techniques in conjunction with a shaped reference beam which may be steered to the spatial sector of interest. Computer simulations on several multiple source examples have demonstrated that the concept is feasible, provided that true time-delay steering is used on the shaped reference beam. The optimal estimation system configuration results when time-delay steering is also applied to the interferometer elements because this focuses the sample covariance matrix and minimizes the DOF required. Transversal filters may be dispensed with under focused conditions if the bandwidth is moderate. System performance goals included high resolution with few DOF, fast response/processing time, moderate cost, and ease of frequent calibration.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/8.192159","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel4/8/4953/00192159.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4953","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/8.192159","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","startPage":"16","endPage":"29","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Large-aperture sparse array antenna systems of moderate bandwidth for multiple emitter location","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=192159","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1989","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1989","displayDocTitle":"Large-aperture sparse array antenna systems of moderate bandwidth for multiple emitter location","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/192159/","volume":"37","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 1989","accessionNumber":"3375668","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Large-aperture sparse array antenna systems of moderate bandwidth for multiple emitter location","sourcePdf":"00192159.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.049451S","chronDate":"Jan 1989","isNumber":"4953","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"3","articleId":"192159","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":192160,"authors":[{"name":"E.H.

The array could be real or synthetic. It is shown that if R(X), the spatial autocorrelation function of the field (as measured by adjacent element pairs), is ensured to be real and positive in the neighborhood of the origin, both periodic and aperiodic arrays can be synchronized, forming retrodirective beams pointing at the axis of symmetry of the radar transmitter, provided that the interelement spacing does not exceed some limit (the order of the size of the transmitting aperture). If the spatial autocorrelation function is complex but has a linear phase, it is shown that one can still synchronize both periodic and aperiodic arrays, while if the phase of R(X) is nonlinear, only periodic arrays can be synchronized. In both cases of complex R(X), a residual beam-pointing error occurs.

The ability of the FD-TD model to obtain the physics of the double-Doppler effect (for the uniform translation case), and frequency-modulation-like reflected spectrum (for the uniform vibration case) is highlighted.

Permutation-based interleaving schemes can be implemented with a small amount of additional hardware and with a minimal time overhead. The results of a detailed simulation analysis are reviewed. The simulation analysis suggests that, with adequate buffering, permutation-based interleaving schemes similar to those studied can be used to implement a high-bandwidth memory system for vector processors. The resulting memory system sustains its bandwidth for a wide variety of access patterns and for large bank busy times far better than a memory system with standard interleaving.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel1/12/4955/00192212.pdf","startPage":"34","endPage":"44","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","doi":"10.1109/12.192212","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/12.192212","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4955","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=192212","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High-bandwidth interleaved memories for vector processors-a simulation study","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bandwidth","Interleaved codes","Vector processors","Analytical models","Throughput","Cache memory","Hardware","Delay","Data structures","Multiprocessor interconnection networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer architecture","parallel processing","storage management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high bandwidth interleaved memories","vector processors","simulation study","alternate interleaving schemes","access patterns","vector processing systems","buffering"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/192212/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1993","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1993","displayDocTitle":"High-bandwidth interleaved memories for vector processors-a simulation study","volume":"42","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 1993","accessionNumber":"4389228","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High-bandwidth interleaved memories for vector processors-a simulation study","sourcePdf":"00192212.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039857S","chronDate":"Jan 1993","isNumber":"4955","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"32","articleId":"192212","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":192217,"authors":[{"name":"Y.H.

For applications where the angle of rotation is known in advance, a method to speed up the execution of the CORDIC algorithm by reducing the total number of iterations is presented. This is accomplished by using a technique called angle recoding, which encodes the desired rotation angle as a linear combination of very few elementary rotation angles. Each of these elementary rotation angles takes one CORDIC iteration to compute. The fewer the number of elementary rotation angles, the fewer the number of iterations are required. A greedy algorithm which takes only O(n/sup 2/) operations is developed to perform CORDIC angle recoding. It is proven that this algorithm is able to reduce the total number of required elementary rotation angles by at least 50% without affecting the computational accuracy.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/192217/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1993","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1993","volume":"42","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"4389233","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Jan. 1993","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"An angle recoding method for CORDIC algorithm implementation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An angle recoding method for CORDIC algorithm implementation","sourcePdf":"00192217.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.069453S","chronDate":"Jan.  1993","isNumber":"4955","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"82","articleId":"192217","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":192219,"authors":[{"name":"T.-H.

The use of electrical pulse measuring techniques in conjunction with light emission measurements using a photomultiplier tube, which allowed simultaneous detection of both spark and glow discharges, permitted the establishment of a definite transition from spark to glow discharges. Spark discharges were found to be responsible for the initial surface modification leading to increased surface conductivity, which favored the transition to a pulseless glow type discharge within the cavity. The latter form of discharge was found to prevail over the major portion of the remainder of the exposure period.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/192234/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1993","volume":"28","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"4409585","publicationDate":"Feb. 1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Spark-to-glow discharge transition due to increased surface conductivity on epoxy resin specimens","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spark-to-glow discharge transition due to increased surface conductivity on epoxy resin specimens","sourcePdf":"00192234.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.042612S","chronDate":"Feb 1993","isNumber":"4956","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"14","citationCount":"113","articleId":"192234","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":192242,"authors":[{"name":"V.

The filters are evaluated with particular reference to distortion introduced on successive PD pulses. A digital filtering method based on a cascaded second-order IIR lattice notch filter is proposed. The study shows that, for similar performance, methods based on linear prediction require longer filter orders when compared to cascaded IIR notch filters. The nonadaptive methods are found to be stable against impulsive disturbances, while adaptive methods are unstable. The method proposed gives the best performance, low distortion to a sequence of PD pulses, good stability, and fast filtering time. The performance at higher sampling rates, even with PD pulses of long widths, is also found to be superior. The method is implemented using fixed-point arithmetic leading to faster processing. Hence, the method is suitable for on-site PD measurements.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electrical Insulation","pdfPath":"/iel1/14/4956/00192242.pdf","startPage":"73","endPage":"85","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electrical Insulation","doi":"10.1109/14.192242","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/14.192242","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4956","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=192242","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Evaluation of digital filters for rejecting discrete spectral interference in on-site PD measurements","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Digital filters","IIR filters","Filtering","Nonlinear filters","Interference","Testing","Lattices","Stability","Sampling methods","Space vector pulse width modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cascade networks","digital filters","insulation testing","notch filters","partial discharges"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["partial discharge testing","discrete spectral interference","DSI","PD pulses","digital filtering method","cascaded second-order IIR lattice notch filter","nonadaptive methods","impulsive disturbances","adaptive methods","filtering time","sampling rates","fixed-point arithmetic","on-site PD measurements"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/192242/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1993","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1993","displayDocTitle":"Evaluation of digital filters for rejecting discrete spectral interference in on-site PD measurements","volume":"28","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 1993","accessionNumber":"4409593","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Evaluation of digital filters for rejecting discrete spectral interference in on-site PD measurements","sourcePdf":"00192242.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.051956S","chronDate":"Feb 1993","isNumber":"4956","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"14","citationCount":"54","articleId":"192242","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-28"},{"_id":192249,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

The anomaly consists of a current peak during isothermal discharge. The peak time, i.e., the time at which the maximum current occurs in the discharge transient, depends not only on temperature and the electric field on charging, but also on the amount of ions in polymer samples and the thickness of the specimen. The amount of charge associated with the current peak is almost independent of the applied field, but depends on temperature. Study of the charge process revealed that poly(vinylidene fluoride) and vinylidene fluoride/trifluoroethylene copolymers exhibit polarization reversal or dielectric hysteresis at high temperatures and a low electric field. Thus, the anomalous discharge process is related to retarded discharge of the ionic charge bound or trapped in the crystalline regions of these copolymers. Polarization reversal at low electric field may be responsible for the anomalous behavior in homopolymer and copolymers of vinylidene fluoride.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/14.192249","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electrical Insulation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electrical Insulation","pdfPath":"/iel1/14/4956/00192249.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/14.192249","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4956","startPage":"128","endPage":"135","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Anomalous discharge in copolymers of vinylidene fluoride","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=192249","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Anomalous discharge in copolymers of vinylidene fluoride","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/192249/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1993","isJournal":true,"volume":"28","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Feb. 1993","accessionNumber":"4409600","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Anomalous discharge in copolymers of vinylidene fluoride","sourcePdf":"00192249.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041479S","chronDate":"Feb 1993","isNumber":"4956","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"14","citationCount":"2","articleId":"192249","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":192325,"authors":[{"name":"T.M.

The influence of reuse distance (i.e. cluster size), traffic intensity (i.e. blocking probability), impulsive index, Rician parameter, and turning point of the dual path loss law characteristic of microcells on the performance parameters is investigated in detail.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel1/25/4958/00192384.pdf","startPage":"33","endPage":"40","doi":"10.1109/25.192384","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/25.192384","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4958","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance of microcellular mobile radio in a cochannel interference, natural, and man-made noise environment","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/192384/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1993","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1993","displayDocTitle":"Performance of microcellular mobile radio in a cochannel interference, natural, and man-made noise environment","publicationDate":"Feb. 1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4389286","isJournal":true,"volume":"42","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance of microcellular mobile radio in a cochannel interference, natural, and man-made noise environment","sourcePdf":"00192384.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037333S","chronDate":"Feb 1993","isNumber":"4958","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"36","articleId":"192384","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":192385,"authors":[{"name":"L.R.

Each signal is coded with the same orthogonal or biorthogonal code, followed by a modulo-2 addition of a unique signature sequence.

An analysis is presented to determine the properties of an optimal set of signature sequences for such a system. Using a Kerdock code, a set of signature sequences is presented which optimizes performance in a direct sequence CDMA system with (a) synchronous transmission, (b) no multipath time dispersion, and (c) orthogonal or biorthogonal Walsh-Hadamard coding as a means of spreading the information signal. For a length-N-binary code (where N is an even power of two), the set contains N/2 signature sequences.

Both coherent and differential detection are considered. In the case of coded DPSK, it is found that full interleaving does not necessarily provide the best error performance, especially when the fading is relatively fast and when the autocorrelation function of the channel fading process exhibits an oscillating behavior. For coherent detection or for differential detection in channels with relatively slow fading, increasing the interleaving depth always improves the error performance. In these cases, an interleaving depth equivalent to one-fifth to one-quarter the duration of a fade cycle is almost as good as full interleaving.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/26.192403","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/26/4959/00192403.pdf","startPage":"1800","endPage":"1809","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.192403","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4959","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Error performance of interleaved trellis-coded PSK modulations in correlated Rayleigh fading channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=192403","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1992","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/192403/","displayDocTitle":"Error performance of interleaved trellis-coded PSK modulations in correlated Rayleigh fading channels","volume":"40","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 1992","accessionNumber":"4392625","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Error performance of interleaved trellis-coded PSK modulations in correlated Rayleigh fading channels","sourcePdf":"00192403.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.045562S","chronDate":"Dec 1992","isNumber":"4959","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"69","articleId":"192403","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":192415,"authors":[{"name":"C.P.

The properties of the operator which approximates a signal at a given resolution were studied. It is shown that the difference of information between the approximation of a signal at the resolutions 2/sup j+1/ and 2/sup j/ (where j is an integer) can be extracted by decomposing this signal on a wavelet orthonormal basis of L/sup 2/(R/sup n/), the vector space of measurable, square-integrable n-dimensional functions. In L/sup 2/(R), a wavelet orthonormal basis is a family of functions which is built by dilating and translating a unique function psi (x). This decomposition defines an orthogonal multiresolution representation called a wavelet representation. It is computed with a pyramidal algorithm based on convolutions with quadrature mirror filters. Wavelet representation lies between the spatial and Fourier domains. For images, the wavelet representation differentiates several spatial orientations. The application of this representation to data compression in image coding, texture discrimination and fractal analysis is discussed.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/34.192463","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/34.192463","startPage":"674","endPage":"693","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel1/34/4963/00192463.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4963","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A theory for multiresolution signal decomposition: the wavelet representation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/192463/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1989","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1989","displayDocTitle":"A theory for multiresolution signal decomposition: the wavelet representation","volume":"11","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"3466263","publicationDate":"July 1989","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A theory for multiresolution signal decomposition: the wavelet representation","sourcePdf":"00192463.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.035546S","chronDate":"Jul 1989","isNumber":"4963","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"13389","articleId":"192463","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-27"},{"_id":192465,"authors":[{"name":"P.

Multiscale nonlinear smoothing filters are first developed, using morphological opening and closings. G. Matheron (1975) used openings and closings to obtain probabilistic size distributions of Euclidean-space sets (continuous binary images). These distributions are used to develop a concept of pattern spectrum (a shape-size descriptor). A pattern spectrum is introduced for continuous graytone images and arbitrary multilevel signals, as well as for discrete images, by developing a discrete-size family of patterns. Large jumps in the pattern spectrum at a certain scale indicate the existence of major (protruding or intruding) substructures of the signal at the scale. An entropy-like shape-size complexity measure is also developed based on the pattern spectrum. For shape representation, a reduced morphological skeleton transform is introduced for discrete binary and graytone images. This transform is a sequence of skeleton components (sparse images) which represent the original shape at various scales. It is shown that the partially reconstructed images from the inverse transform on subsequences of skeleton components are the openings of the image at a scale determined by the number of eliminated components; in addition, two-way correspondences are established among the degree of shape smoothing via multiscale openings or closings, the pattern spectrum zero values, and the elimination or nonexistence of skeleton components at certain scales.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/34.192465","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4963","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/34.192465","endPage":"716","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel1/34/4963/00192465.pdf","startPage":"701","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Pattern spectrum and multiscale shape representation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  1989","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  1989","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/192465/","displayDocTitle":"Pattern spectrum and multiscale shape representation","volume":"11","issue":"7","accessionNumber":"3466265","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"July 1989","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Pattern spectrum and multiscale shape representation","sourcePdf":"00192465.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047926S","chronDate":"July  1989","isNumber":"4963","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"477","articleId":"192465","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":192466,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Local texture properties are extracted using local linear transforms that have been optimized for maximal texture discrimination. Local statistics (texture energy measures) are estimated at the output of an equivalent filter bank by means of a nonlinear transformation (absolute value) followed by an iterative Gaussian smoothing algorithm. This procedure generates a multiresolution sequence of feature planes with a half-octave scale progression. A feature reduction technique is then applied to the data and is determined by simultaneously diagonalizing scatter matrices evaluated at two different spatial resolutions. This approach provides a good approximation of R.A. Fisher's (1950) multiple linear discriminants and has the advantage of requiring no a priori knowledge. This feature reduction methods appears to be an improvement on the commonly used Karhunen-Loeve transform and allows efficient texture segmentation based on simple thresholding.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/34.192466","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel1/34/4963/00192466.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/34.192466","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4963","startPage":"717","endPage":"728","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiresolution feature extraction and selection for texture segmentation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=192466","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Multiresolution feature extraction and selection for texture segmentation","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1989","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/192466/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1989","isJournal":true,"volume":"11","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 1989","accessionNumber":"3466266","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiresolution feature extraction and selection for texture segmentation","sourcePdf":"00192466.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.048429S","chronDate":"Jul 1989","isNumber":"4963","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"216","articleId":"192466","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":192470,"authors":[{"name":"D.S.

An initial estimate of a hypothesized curve is first obtained by a statistical windowing technique. A search region is determined and iteratively grown. Edge points in the search region are tested for their goodness-of-fit to the previous estimate. The estimate is iteratively updated with the edge points that have favorable goodness-of-fit measures. The edge points having poor goodness-of-fit measures are rejected as outliers. The algorithm drives the estimate to converge to a final solution. By repeatedly applying this procedure to the edge data excluded from the previous fitting, all the underlying curves are reconstructed. The major feature that distinguishes this approach from that of others is that classifying the edge data prior to fitting is not required. Advantages of this algorithm are: (1) the fitting procedure achieves higher robustness and accuracy by dynamically analyzing the data consistency; (2) the computational complexity increases only linearly with the number of edge data; (3) the algorithm readily extends to reconstruct surfaces from range data. Thus the algorithm provides a powerful technique enabling a data-driven intermediate-level vision module to extract parametric features needed for higher-level processing.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4963","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/34.192470","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel1/34/4963/00192470.pdf","startPage":"749","endPage":"758","doi":"10.1109/34.192470","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A data-driven intermediate level feature extraction algorithm","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1989","displayDocTitle":"A data-driven intermediate level feature extraction algorithm","volume":"11","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 1989","accessionNumber":"3466270","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/192470/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1989","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A data-driven intermediate level feature extraction algorithm","sourcePdf":"00192470.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039491S","chronDate":"Jul 1989","isNumber":"4963","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"43","articleId":"192470","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":192473,"authors":[{"name":"I.

This technique is passive and requires only a single camera. The most difficult segment of calculating depth from focus is deconvolving the defocus operator from the scene and modeling it. Most current methods for determining the defocus operator employ inverse filtering. The authors reveal some fundamental problems with inverse filtering: inaccuracies in finding the frequency domain representation, windowing effects, and border effects. A general, matrix-based method using regularization is presented, which eliminates these problems.

For the sake of comparison, a numerical model consisting of two nonconcentric cylinders is considered and reconstructed using both geometries from simulated experimental data. The scattered fields and reconstructed images permit extraction of very useful information about dynamic range, sensitivity, resolution, and quantitative image accuracy for the choice of the configuration in a particular application. Both geometries can measure forward and backward scattered fields. The backscattering measurement improves the image resolution and reconstruction in lossy mediums, but, on the other hand, has several dynamic range difficulties. This tradeoff between forward only and forward-backward field measurement is analyzed. As differential temperature imaging is a weakly scattering problem, Born approximation algorithms can be used. The simplicity of Born reconstruction algorithms and the use of FFT make them very attractive for real-time biomedical imaging systems.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/42.192681","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","pdfPath":"/iel1/42/4968/00192681.pdf","startPage":"457","endPage":"469","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4968","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/42.192681","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1992","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1992","displayDocTitle":"Planar and cylindrical active microwave temperature imaging: numerical simulations","volume":"11","issue":"4","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Dec. 1992","accessionNumber":"4378906","pubMedId":"18222887","isJournal":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/192681/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Planar and cylindrical active microwave temperature imaging: numerical simulations","sourcePdf":"00192681.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033763S","chronDate":"Dec.  1992","isNumber":"4968","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"42","citationCount":"40","articleId":"192681","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":192694,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Fifteen block detectors are positioned to form a 35-cm-diameter ring, with four BGO arrays coupled to each PMT. This provides four detector rings, giving the system a 7-slice imaging capability. The gantry head tilts up to +or-90 degrees , and is capable of moving up and down by 30 cm. These positioning capabilities allow flexibility and great ease of use in subject positioning. A gantry entrance size of 22 cm in diameter allows studies ranging from rats and mice to primates such as Rhesus and squirrel monkeys.

The output current of this structure, unlike that of NBiMOS transistors, is significant even when the output voltage (V/sub CE/ or V/sub DE/) is less than the turn-on voltage of the n-p-n bipolar transistor (V/sub BE/= approximately 0.8 V). This structure, when used in BiCMOS logic gates, will allow the output voltage to swing all the way to 0.0 V rather than to 0.8 V. The feasibility of this concept was demonstrated by fabricating and DC characterizing the NBiBMOS transistor structures, which occupy approximately 1.2 times the area of a single n-p-n bipolar transistor. The NBiBMOS transistor has a higher drive capability than that of a structure consisting of an NBiMOS and a separate bypass transistor, because the body-source junction of the bypass NMOS transistor is forward biased.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/55.192840","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/55.192840","startPage":"563","endPage":"565","publicationTitle":"IEEE Electron Device Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Electron Device Letters","pdfPath":"/iel1/55/4975/00192840.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4975","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An NMOS input merged bipolar/sidewall-MOS transistor with a bypass sidewall MOS transistor (NBiBMOS transistor)","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/192840/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1992","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1992","displayDocTitle":"An NMOS input merged bipolar/sidewall-MOS transistor with a bypass sidewall MOS transistor (NBiBMOS transistor)","volume":"13","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4306486","publicationDate":"Nov. 1992","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An NMOS input merged bipolar/sidewall-MOS transistor with a bypass sidewall MOS transistor (NBiBMOS transistor)","sourcePdf":"00192840.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.042869S","chronDate":"Nov.  1992","isNumber":"4975","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"55","articleId":"192840","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Letter","lastupdate":"2021-09-28"},{"_id":192842,"authors":[{"name":"M.

A technique for system admittance matrix reduction is developed that proves efficient, especially for large systems and multiple-contingency evaluation. The method's main appeal is rapidity: it is about one order of magnitude faster than the most efficient direct criterion. Other attractive features are flexibility and ability to encompass various simulation conditions. Extensions to online sensitivity analysis and control are suggested.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1988","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/192890/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1988","volume":"3","issue":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 1988","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"3293247","displayDocTitle":"A simple direct method for fast transient stability assessment of large power systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A simple direct method for fast transient stability assessment of large power systems","sourcePdf":"00192890.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.042479S","chronDate":"May  1988","isNumber":"4977","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"183","articleId":"192890","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1988","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":192892,"authors":[{"name":"F.N.

Injected currents applied to a base network are used to model the switching operation. These currents are used as variables in a linear programming (LP) problem formulation. The objective function, i.e. the change in losses, can be expressed by the injected currents, taking into account that all nodes are constrained by constant active powers except for the slack node. The change of power of the slack node is the change in losses, which is obtained by a two-step approximation. Each single optimal switching operation is obtained by an LP-like operation followed by a load-flow update. The interaction between LP and AC load-flow leads to a sequence of optimal switching operations whereby losses are reduced to a minimum subject to the given constraints.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel1/59/4977/00192895.pdf","startPage":"447","endPage":"454","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","doi":"10.1109/59.192895","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/59.192895","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4977","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=192895","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Loss reduction by network switching","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Load flow","Propagation losses","Control systems","Power system modeling","Voltage","Optimization methods","Minimization methods","Power systems","Energy management","Power transmission"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distribution networks","linear programming","load flow","losses","switching"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["loss reduction","systematic switching","network switching","fast switching","linear programming","optimal switching operation","load-flow","AC load-flow"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/192895/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1988","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1988","displayDocTitle":"Loss reduction by network switching","volume":"3","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 1988","accessionNumber":"3293252","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Loss reduction by network switching","sourcePdf":"00192895.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.025772S","chronDate":"May  1988","isNumber":"4977","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"83","articleId":"192895","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1988","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":192898,"authors":[{"name":"D.Y.

Primary feeders are typically radial in structure. To increase system reliability, neighboring feeders are connected through a normally open tie switch. When load zones on a feeder interrupted due to a fault, system operators need to identify neighboring feeders and try to restore customers through the tie switches. To restore the maximum number of zones, several steps are followed: group restoration, zone restoration and, if necessary, load transfer. Based on the methodology, an expert system is developed which can be utilized as an online aid to system operators in a distribution SCADA (supervisory control and data acquisition) environmental. The proposed expert system is implemented in Prolog. Knowledge representation, portability of the system, and computational efficiency are discussed. Several examples illustrate the capabilities of the system.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel1/59/4977/00192914.pdf","startPage":"619","endPage":"626","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","doi":"10.1109/59.192914","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/59.192914","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4977","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=192914","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An expert system operational aid for restoration and loss reduction of distribution systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Expert systems","Power system restoration","Switches","Diagnostic expert systems","Control systems","Power system protection","Voltage","Power system interconnection","Power system stability","Student members"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distribution networks","expert systems","reliability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distribution system restoration","primary feeders","knowledge representation","expert system operational aid","loss reduction","reliability","tie switch","load zones","load transfer","SCADA","supervisory control and data acquisition","Prolog","portability","computational efficiency"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/192914/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1988","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1988","displayDocTitle":"An expert system operational aid for restoration and loss reduction of distribution systems","volume":"3","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 1988","accessionNumber":"3283703","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An expert system operational aid for restoration and loss reduction of distribution systems","sourcePdf":"00192914.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036921S","chronDate":"May  1988","isNumber":"4977","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"354","articleId":"192914","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1988","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":192915,"authors":[{"name":"E.

Knowledge of the actual loading provides an improved decision basis for system expansion, ant the operation of distribution systems requires a large number of planned or forced switching operations, for which it is necessary to know the hourly load behavior at the substation level. The individual loads are calculated by using estimation methods to determine the future load behavior on the basis of typical past measurements. The mathematical problem is formulated as a linear model relating load measurements with normalized load curves (state variables) for the individual customer groups. The linear model is given by a priori knowledge of the normalized load curves and the fixed load composition at the substation level. Used together with nonlinear models describing external influences, such as temperature, it is possible to predict the load behavior in any substation, based on the estimates of the normalized load curves.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Load modeling","Predictive models","Load forecasting","Substations","Economic forecasting","Load management","Power generation economics","Energy measurement","Power system modeling","Power system economics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distribution networks","load forecasting"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bus load modelling","bus load forecasting","electric distribution systems","switching operations","hourly load behavior","estimation methods","fixed load composition","substation","normalized load curves"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4977","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/59.192915","startPage":"627","endPage":"633","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel1/59/4977/00192915.pdf","doi":"10.1109/59.192915","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bus load modelling and forecasting","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1988","displayDocTitle":"Bus load modelling and forecasting","accessionNumber":"3272709","publicationDate":"May 1988","volume":"3","issue":"2","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/192915/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1988","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bus load modelling and forecasting","sourcePdf":"00192915.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033369S","chronDate":"May  1988","isNumber":"4977","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"48","articleId":"192915","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1988","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":192918,"authors":[{"name":"D.J.

The objective is to investigate the extent to which a computer program with knowledge and inference capabilities can assist a human operator in this task. A rule-based system for screening the consequences of single outages was developed which can be extended to deal with multiple outages. The rules are independent of the size of the power system and derive partly from human operator expertise and partly from simulation models. Results show that such systems can be very effective in focusing attention on a much-reduced number of the more critical contingencies. The expert system was demonstrated using a power system model of moderate size (25 buses, 35 lines). This approach is cost effective and can be applied to online operation.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/59.192918","startPage":"647","endPage":"653","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/59.192918","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4977","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel1/59/4977/00192918.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An artificial intelligence system for power system contingency screening","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/192918/","displayDocTitle":"An artificial intelligence system for power system contingency screening","volume":"3","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"3283706","publicationDate":"May 1988","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1988","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1988","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An artificial intelligence system for power system contingency screening","sourcePdf":"00192918.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.032989S","chronDate":"May  1988","isNumber":"4977","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"53","articleId":"192918","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1988","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":192922,"authors":[{"name":"W.F.

The concepts of digital adaptive protection in which relay characteristics are modified in response to external signals and conditions in the system, are examined. The importance of real-time phasor measurements in adaptive protection systems is illustrated by two examples. The first involves obtaining synchronizing information about phasor measurements to be used for current differential protection of a multithermal line. By estimating the reference angles for the phasor measurements the effect of synchronized sampling can be obtained without the expense of synchronizing equipment. The second use is the adaptive setting of out-of-step blocking and tripping. Traditional approaches experience problems because the settings are, of necessity, compromises based on offline studies. By reacting to real-time phasor measurements from selected buses in interconnection, it is shown that improved out-of-step blocking and tripping is possible.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/59.192936","pdfPath":"/iel1/59/4977/00192936.pdf","startPage":"791","endPage":"798","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/59.192936","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4977","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Some applications of phasor measurements to adaptive protection","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/192936/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1988","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1988","displayDocTitle":"Some applications of phasor measurements to adaptive protection","volume":"3","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"3301436","publicationDate":"May 1988","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Some applications of phasor measurements to adaptive protection","sourcePdf":"00192936.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.056297S","chronDate":"May  1988","isNumber":"4977","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"76","articleId":"192936","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1988","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":192948,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

Several methods have been proposed to circumvent the problem. A comparative study of five methods, namely, the normal equations method, the orthogonal transformation method, the hybrid method, normal equations with constraints, and Hachtel's augmented matrix method for state estimation has been conducted. The comparison is made in terms of their (i) numerical stability, (ii) computational efficiency, and (iii) implementation complexity. A theoretical analysis indicates that the orthogonal transformation method is numerically most stable. But the orthogonal transformation method cannot be implemented in the efficient fast decoupled version. It is shown that the hybrid method and Hachtel's method are both good compromises between numerical stability and computational efficiency.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/59.192998","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel1/59/4978/00192998.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/59.192998","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4978","startPage":"1798","endPage":"1806","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Comparison of different methods for state estimation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=192998","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Comparison of different methods for state estimation","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1988","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/192998/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1988","isJournal":true,"volume":"3","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Nov. 1988","accessionNumber":"3334038","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparison of different methods for state estimation","sourcePdf":"00192998.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.035439S","chronDate":"Nov.  1988","isNumber":"4978","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"144","articleId":"192998","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1988","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":193054,"authors":[{"name":"K.B.

The direct cross-correlation method is analyzed and compared to the average square difference function (ASDF) and the (addition only based) average magnitude difference function (AMDF) estimators, Their relative accuracy is theoretically evaluated, and previous empirical results are explained. It is shown that both the ASDF- and the AMDF-based estimators outperform the direct cross-correlation based estimator for medium-high signal-to-noise ratios. Moreover, the AMDF-based estimator, which avoids any multiplications, significantly reduces the computational complexity of the estimation procedure while offering only a moderate performance loss with respect to the ASDF based estimator.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/78.193195","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/4984/00193195.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.193195","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4984","startPage":"525","endPage":"533","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Discrete time techniques for time delay estimation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=193195","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Discrete time techniques for time delay estimation","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/193195/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1993","isJournal":true,"volume":"41","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 1993","accessionNumber":"4393982","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Discrete time techniques for time delay estimation","sourcePdf":"00193195.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.063371S","chronDate":"Feb 1993","isNumber":"4984","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"283","articleId":"193195","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":193196,"authors":[{"name":"K.

The technique is similar to Gauss-Seidel (GS) iteration for the solution of differential equations on finite grids. The computational cost per iteration of the GS approach is found to be approximately equal to that of gradient methods. For continuously valued images, GS is found to have significantly better convergence at modes representing high spatial frequencies. In addition, GS is well suited to segmentation when the image is constrained to be discretely valued. It is shown that Bayesian segmentation using GS iteration produces useful estimates at much lower signal-to-noise ratios than required for continuously valued reconstruction. The convergence properties of gradient ascent and GS for reconstruction from integral projections are analyzed, and simulations of both maximum-likelihood and maximum a posteriori cases are included.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/78.193196","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/4984/00193196.pdf","startPage":"534","endPage":"548","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.193196","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4984","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A local update strategy for iterative reconstruction from projections","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=193196","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1993","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/193196/","displayDocTitle":"A local update strategy for iterative reconstruction from projections","volume":"41","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 1993","accessionNumber":"4393983","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A local update strategy for iterative reconstruction from projections","sourcePdf":"00193196.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038126S","chronDate":"Feb 1993","isNumber":"4984","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"342","articleId":"193196","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":193198,"authors":[{"name":"A.S.

A class of recursive filtering algorithms for the efficient implementation of B-spline interpolation and approximation techniques is described. In terms of simplicity of realization and reduction of computational complexity, these algorithms compare favorably with conventional matrix approaches. A filtering interpretation (low-pass filter followed by an exact polynomial spline interpolator) of smoothing spline and least-squares approximation methods is proposed. These techniques are applied to the design of digital filters for cubic spline signal processing. An efficient implementation of a smoothing spline edge detector is proposed. It is also shown how to construct a cubic spline image pyramid that minimizes the loss of information in passage from one resolution level to the next. In terms of common measures of fidelity, this data structure appears to be superior to the Gaussian/Laplacian pyramid.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/78.193221","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/4984/00193221.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.193221","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4984","startPage":"834","endPage":"848","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"B-spline signal processing.

The minimax (L/sub infinity /- or Chebyshev norm) and the least absolute value (L/sub 1/-norm) optimization criteria for linear parameter estimation problems are reformulated as constrained minimization problems. For these problems appropriate energy (Lyapunov) functions are constructed which enable the problems to be mapped into systems of nonlinear ordinary differential equations. On the basis of these systems of equations, analog neuronlike network architectures are proposed and their properties are discussed. The proposed circuit structures exhibit a high degree of modularity, and in most cases a relatively small number of basic building blocks (processing units) are required to implement effective and powerful optimization algorithms. The validity and performance of the architectures are illustrated by extensive computer simulations and CMOS implementations of a general-purpose network architecture are considered.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/82.193316","startPage":"619","endPage":"633","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Analog and Digital Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/82/4985/00193316.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Analog and Digital Signal Processing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/82.193316","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4985","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neural networks for solving systems of linear equations.

Traditional methods to obtain the rotor position are based on optical, inductive or Hall effect sensors. These are expensive to install and can be unreliable. Researchers have investigated various sensorless position detection techniques for all types of brushless permanent magnet and reluctance motor drives. The authors discuss the basic principles of sensorless rotor position detection in brushless permanent-magnet and reluctance motor drives. Existing techniques for sensorless rotor position detection from the literature are reviewed. All the methods proposed in the literature extract the rotor position information from measurements on the phase winding circuits. Such techniques therefore eliminate the connections of the sensor to the motor and controller simplifying the system construction. Furthermore, continuous rotor position information can be obtained for optimal control.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5003","startPage":"8/1","endPage":"8/6","displayPublicationTitle":"IEE Colloquium on Variable Speed Drives and Motion Control","pdfPath":"/iel3/1502/5003/00193677.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sensorless commutation techniques for brushless permanent-magnet and reluctance motor drives","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IET","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/193677/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-4 Nov. 1992","displayDocTitle":"Sensorless commutation techniques for brushless permanent-magnet and reluctance motor drives","conferenceDate":"4-4 Nov. 1992","publicationDate":"1992","accessionNumber":"4311173","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sensorless commutation techniques for brushless permanent-magnet and reluctance motor drives","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"00193677.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.029613S","chronDate":"4-4 Nov. 1992","isNumber":"5003","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1502","citationCount":"7","articleId":"193677","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":193701,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The method requires no offline setup and can handle contingencies with network topology changes of any type. The method is based on the incremental angle criterion and the fast decoupled power flow.

The technique presented prevents these oscillations by providing critical damping of the discontinuity within one Delta t of the simulation. The critical damping adjustment (CDA) is achieved by means of two Delta t/2 integration steps using the backward Euler rule. With the CDA scheme the trapezoidal rule can still be used throughout the entire simulation without the problem at discontinuities.

The results show that properly implemented second-order OPF solution methods are robust with respect to different starting points, the decoupled OPF solution is expected to be close to the full OPF solution, and the effects of discretization of load tap changing (LTC) transformer taps are very small and usually negligible. The test procedure required two optimizations. During the first optimization, the transformer taps were treated as continuous variables. Using the continuous solution, the LTC taps were moved to their closest allowable discrete values. During the second optimization the LTC transformer taps were held fixed at their discretized values. The second solution was compared to the first. A small difference between these two solutions indicates that the effects of the transformer tap discretization were minimal.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/59.193850","pdfPath":"/iel1/59/5012/00193850.pdf","startPage":"748","endPage":"759","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/59.193850","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5012","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Large-scale optimal power flow: effects of initialization, decoupling and discretization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/193850/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1989","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1989","displayDocTitle":"Large-scale optimal power flow: effects of initialization, decoupling and discretization","volume":"4","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"3435216","publicationDate":"May 1989","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Large-scale optimal power flow: effects of initialization, decoupling and discretization","sourcePdf":"00193850.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.027428S","chronDate":"May  1989","isNumber":"5012","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"88","articleId":"193850","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":193851,"authors":[{"name":"R.A.M. van Amerongen","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Delft University of Technnology, Delft, Netherlands"],"firstName":"R.A.M.","lastName":"van Amerongen","id":"37298804700"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0885-8950"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0679"}],"articleNumber":"193851","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":119,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":1286},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Power & Energy Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/portal/index.jsp?pageID=pes_home"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Load flow","Jacobian matrices","Newton method","Power systems","System testing","Convergence","Low voltage","Power system reliability","Power engineering and energy","Systems engineering and theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["iterative methods","load flow","power systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fast decoupled load flow","power systems","iteration scheme"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A general-purpose version of the fast decoupled load flow","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=193851","doi":"10.1109/59.193851","startPage":"760","endPage":"770","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel1/59/5012/00193851.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/59.193851","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5012","abstract":"A new version of the fast decoupled load flow, in which a more broad range of power systems can be solved, is presented. The key lies in the different way in which the resistances are ignored and in a different iteration scheme. In the standard algorithm the resistances are ignored while building the B' load flow matrix: it is shown that it is preferable that the resistances are ignored in the B\" matrix instead of the B' matrix. For normal test systems there is hardly any difference in the number of iterations. However, the new algorithm iterates faster if one or more problematic R/X ratios are present. An iteration scheme with strict successive P and Q iterations prevents cycling convergence behavior which can be found in some low voltage systems. The advantages of the new version are demonstrated with runs on IEEE test systems, with both uniformly and nonuniformly scaled reactances. R-scaling up to 3 is always possible, and sometimes values up to 5 can be used. X-scaling of at least 0.1 is possible without losing convergence and with iteration counts which are significantly lower than with the standard scheme.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1989","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/193851/","volume":"4","issue":"2","publicationDate":"May 1989","accessionNumber":"3435217","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1989","displayDocTitle":"A general-purpose version of the fast decoupled load flow","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A general-purpose version of the fast decoupled load flow","sourcePdf":"00193851.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.030109S","chronDate":"May  1989","isNumber":"5012","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"119","articleId":"193851","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":193853,"authors":[{"name":"L.

In low-conductivity (250- mu S/cm) fog, silicone rubber performed better than EPDM samples, whereas in high-conductivity (1000- mu S/cm) fog, the order of performance was reversed. The mechanisms by which fillers impart tracking and erosion resistance to materials is discussed as influenced by the experimental conditions of the accelerated aging tests. Surface studies by ESCA (electron spectroscopy for chemical analysis) demonstrate that the hydrophobicity of silicone rubber, despite the accumulation of surface contamination, can be attributed to migration of low-molecular-weight polymer chains and/or mobile fluids, such as silicone oil.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/61.193898","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","pdfPath":"/iel3/61/5013/00193898.pdf","startPage":"1157","endPage":"1164","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/61.193898","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5013","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The electrical performance of polymeric insulating materials under accelerated aging in a fog chamber","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=193898","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1988","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1988","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/193898/","displayDocTitle":"The electrical performance of polymeric insulating materials under accelerated aging in a fog chamber","volume":"3","issue":"3","publicationDate":"July 1988","accessionNumber":"3293232","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The electrical performance of polymeric insulating materials under accelerated aging in a fog chamber","sourcePdf":"00193898.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.049809S","chronDate":"Jul 1988","isNumber":"5013","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"61","citationCount":"156","articleId":"193898","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1988","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":193906,"authors":[{"name":"S.

A straightforward method is developed which is capable of examining the effects of continuous system reconfiguration of switches and capacitors with automated distribution control (ADC) on a portion of the Pennsylvania Power and Light Company (PP&L) service territory. A load model and an electrical model are applied in a six-step method. The development of this method was made possible by two key elements: the availability of unique time-of-day load data from a historical survey of several PP&L feeders; and the use of an advanced integrated distribution system modeling and analysis package. The results show that the application of ADC techniques provide potential distribution system loss reductions which could not otherwise be achieved.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/61.193908","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","startPage":"1232","endPage":"1240","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/61.193908","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5013","pdfPath":"/iel3/61/5013/00193908.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power system modeling","Costs","Knowledge engineering","Power engineering and energy","Continuous time systems","Switches","Capacitors","Automatic control","Lighting control","Control systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distribution networks","power system analysis computing","power system computer control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power system computer control","USA","power system analysis computing","automated distribution control","costs","losses","distribution system","system reconfiguration","switches","capacitors","load model","electrical model","load data","modeling","analysis package"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A method and its application to evaluate automated distribution control","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/193908/","volume":"3","issue":"3","accessionNumber":"3301428","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"July 1988","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1988","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1988","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A method and its application to evaluate automated distribution control","sourcePdf":"00193908.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037228S","chronDate":"Jul 1988","isNumber":"5013","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"61","citationCount":"34","articleId":"193908","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1988","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":193912,"authors":[{"name":"K.

These include changes in online relay settings, relay characteristics, or logic in response to power system or environmental changes, or as a result of operating experience. Such changes as line-out or generator-out contingencies, which affect fault current distributions and degrade the system's security level, initiate adaptive protection system responses. Adaptive relaying is shown to be capable of improving relaying reliability and power system security and of achieving better utilization of transmission facilities. Most of the concepts require a hierarchical computer system, involving front-line parallel processors, a substation host, and remote central processors, all linked by channels that transmit data or relaying changes prior to or after a disturbance. It is suggested that maximum value from adaptive relaying will result from integration with existing or planned substation control and data acquisition functions and interfacing with the central energy management system (EMS). Emphasis is placed on use of interim hardware approaches to allow evolutionary development.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/61.193943","pdfPath":"/iel3/61/5014/00193943.pdf","startPage":"1446","endPage":"1458","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/61.193943","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5014","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive transmission relaying concepts for improved performance","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/193943/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1988","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1988","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive transmission relaying concepts for improved performance","volume":"3","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"3333833","publicationDate":"Oct. 1988","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive transmission relaying concepts for improved performance","sourcePdf":"00193943.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.031728S","chronDate":"Oct 1988","isNumber":"5014","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"61","citationCount":"154","articleId":"193943","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1988","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":193948,"authors":[{"name":"B.D.

The algorithm is based on the assumption that target maneuvers are a piecewise constant process where transitions from one acceleration level to another occur relatively infrequently in time. The development is a two-step procedure using both separated-bias and nonGaussian random transition theory developed by B. Friedland (1969, 1979). A nonlinear maneuver-detection algorithm is designed to signal when a target maneuver has actually occurred, and a linear separate-bias filter, designed under the assumption that the time of the target maneuver is known, is used to estimate the target acceleration vector. Simulation results are presented to demonstrate the efficacy of the procedure. Results indicate that the proposed technique is a viable approach to reduce terminal miss distance in air-to-air intercept scenarios against highly maneuverable targets.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/CDC.1988.194431","pdfPath":"/iel2/716/5019/00194431.pdf","startPage":"851","endPage":"855 vol.1","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 27th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 27th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CDC.1988.194431","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5019","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Target maneuver detection and estimation (missile guidance)","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/194431/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 Dec 1988","displayDocTitle":"Target maneuver detection and estimation (missile guidance)","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"3380489","publicationDate":"1988","conferenceDate":"7-9 Dec. 1988","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Target maneuver detection and estimation (missile guidance)","confLoc":"Austin, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"00194431.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.02597S","chronDate":"7-9 Dec 1988","isNumber":"5019","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"716","citationCount":"11","articleId":"194431","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1988","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":194536,"authors":[{"name":"P.

Naturalness means that a control engineer can express specifications in his terms, by referring directly to signal peaks, overshoots, RMS powers, pulse responses, etc., rather than other, less direct (and more opaque) expressions (e.g. a quadratic integral in LQR or LQG). Effectiveness means that if a controller meeting the specifications exists, then the method will find it. The three main concepts for the proposed MRSDFS CAD method are: (1) shift-invariant representations for multi-rate systems; (2) parametrization of stabilizing controllers and convexity of specifications; and (3) machine intelligence and control specification language compilers. Rather than rigorously discussing each topic in depth and full generality, the author chooses a simple example and discusses each concept as it arises in the course of designing a MRSDFS.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/CDC.1988.194656","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 27th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 27th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control","pdfPath":"/iel2/716/5019/00194656.pdf","startPage":"1889","endPage":"1891 vol.3","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CDC.1988.194656","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5019","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Toward a new CAD method for MIMO multi-rate digital controllers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=194656","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 Dec 1988","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/194656/","displayDocTitle":"Toward a new CAD method for MIMO multi-rate digital controllers","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1988","accessionNumber":"3389850","conferenceDate":"7-9 Dec. 1988","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Toward a new CAD method for MIMO multi-rate digital controllers","confLoc":"Austin, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"00194656.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.03249S","chronDate":"7-9 Dec 1988","isNumber":"5019","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"716","citationCount":"2","articleId":"194656","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1988","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":194705,"authors":[{"name":"I.

Approximate calculations suggest that load reactive power balance is an important factor in this collapse.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A model of voltage collapse in electric power systems","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 27th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control","doi":"10.1109/CDC.1988.194705","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 27th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control","pdfPath":"/iel2/716/5019/00194705.pdf","startPage":"2104","endPage":"2109 vol.3","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CDC.1988.194705","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5019","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=194705","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/194705/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 Dec 1988","displayDocTitle":"A model of voltage collapse in electric power systems","conferenceDate":"7-9 Dec. 1988","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1988","accessionNumber":"3380514","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A model of voltage collapse in electric power systems","confLoc":"Austin, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"00194705.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041343S","chronDate":"7-9 Dec 1988","isNumber":"5019","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"716","citationCount":"68","articleId":"194705","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1988","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":194759,"authors":[{"name":"S.C.A.

The sensors obtain measurements about target trajectories at random times which transmit to the fusion center. The measurements arrive at the fusion with random delays which can be due to queuing at the sensor buffer and to delays in the transmission time as well as in the propagation time. The fusion generates estimates of the target tracks using the received measurements. The measurements are received from the sensors at random times, can have unknown time-origin and can arrive out of sequence. Optimal filters for the estimation of target tracks based on measurements of uncertain origin received by the fusion at random times and out of sequence have been derived for the cases of random sampling, random delay, and both random sampling and random delay. It is shown that the optimal filters constitute an extension to the Kalman filter to account for the uncertainty involved with the data time-origin.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Filtering","Sampling methods","Delay estimation","Sensor fusion","Delay effects","Propagation delay","Target tracking","Filters","Trajectory","Time measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["delays","filtering and prediction theory","signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["target tracking","distributed filtering","signal processing","random sampling","delay","distributed sensor environment","random times"]}],"doi":"10.1109/CDC.1988.194759","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 27th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 27th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control","pdfPath":"/iel2/716/5019/00194759.pdf","startPage":"2348","endPage":"2353 vol.3","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5019","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CDC.1988.194759","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed filtering with random sampling and delay","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=194759","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Distributed filtering with random sampling and delay","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/194759/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1988","accessionNumber":"3389946","conferenceDate":"7-9 Dec. 1988","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 Dec 1988","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed filtering with random sampling and delay","confLoc":"Austin, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"00194759.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.032268S","chronDate":"7-9 Dec 1988","isNumber":"5019","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"716","citationCount":"15","articleId":"194759","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1988","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":194789,"authors":[{"name":"M.M.

Using the diagonalizer algorithm, the error probability, P/sub e/, is calculated for crosstalk and signal-to-noise levels with uniform distributions of the crosstalk phase shift. The frequency of occurrence of P/sub e/ versus crosstalk phase shift, with crosstalk level as a parameter, and a three-dimensional plot of P/sub e/ as a function of the two crosstalk phase shifts are discussed. The receiver performance is acceptable in the presence of crosstalk levels that would otherwise render the system inoperable. However, depending on crosstalk level, P/sub e/ can have a range of 100:1 or more as different relative phase shifts are encountered.

The implementation of a frequency-based network as a pattern recognizer is considered, along with possible specific applications.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/NAECON.1988.195171","startPage":"1287","endPage":"1291 vol.4","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE 1988 National Aerospace and Electronics Conference","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NAECON.1988.195171","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5021","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE 1988 National Aerospace and Electronics Conference","pdfPath":"/iel2/748/5021/00195171.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Frequency-based model of memory in neural networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/195171/","displayDocTitle":"Frequency-based model of memory in neural networks","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"3228706","publicationDate":"1988","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"23-27 May 1988","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-27 May 1988","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Frequency-based model of memory in neural networks","confLoc":"Dayton, OH, USA","sourcePdf":"00195171.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052658S","chronDate":"23-27 May 1988","isNumber":"5021","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"748","articleId":"195171","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1988","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":195173,"authors":[{"name":"A.D.

It is shown that there is a difference in error sensitivity of four orders of magnitude between the most sensitive and the least sensitive bits of the speech coder. As a result, a family of rate-compatible punctured convolutional codes with flexible unequal error protection capabilities has been matched to the speech coder. On a Rayleigh fading channel with 4-DPSK modulation, as much as 5-dB gain in channel signal-to-noise ratio can be obtained by using four levels of error protection compared to only two levels in more conventional designs. The gain is achieved at no extra bandwidth requirement and at a negligible complexity increase. Among the results, analysis and informal listening tests show that with a four-level unequal error protection scheme, transmission of 12-kb/s speech is possible with little degradation in quality over speech is possible with little degradation in quality over a 16-kb/s channel with an average bit error rate of 2*10/sup -2/ at a vehicle speed of 60 mph.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 Jun 1988","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/195349/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"3257914","publicationDate":"1988","conferenceDate":"15-17 June 1988","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Variable-rate sub-band speech coding and matched channel coding for mobile radio channels","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Variable-rate sub-band speech coding and matched channel coding for mobile radio channels","confLoc":"Philadelphia, PA, USA","sourcePdf":"00195349.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056804S","chronDate":"15-17 Jun 1988","isNumber":"5022","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"757","citationCount":"8","articleId":"195349","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1988","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":195356,"authors":[{"name":"T.

It is found that a promising technique is 30 kHz TDMA (time-division multiple access). This method simplifies the coexistence with the present analog cellular system. The existing frequency plan can be used and there is no need to allocate separate frequencies for the digital system. 30 kHz TDMA allows that the system be based on low risk, high-quality speech coding; and, at the same time, it can support lower rate speech codecs. The TDMA approach allows that the existing 30 kHz channels are divided into two or three TDMA-slots in a flexible way without affecting frequency planning.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VETEC.1988.195410","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5022","startPage":"516","endPage":"519","displayPublicationTitle":"38th IEEE Vehicular Technology Conference","pdfPath":"/iel2/757/5022/00195410.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Digital technologies in cellular radio","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/195410/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 Jun 1988","displayDocTitle":"Digital technologies in cellular radio","conferenceDate":"15-17 June 1988","publicationDate":"1988","accessionNumber":"3257949","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Digital technologies in cellular radio","confLoc":"Philadelphia, PA, USA","sourcePdf":"00195410.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.025253S","chronDate":"15-17 Jun 1988","isNumber":"5022","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"757","citationCount":"14","articleId":"195410","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1988","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":195429,"authors":[{"name":"J.

A Kalman filter has been developed as part of this SAR motion compensation system which uses a low-cost strapdown IMU (inertial measurement unit), to measure antenna motion. The function of the Kalman filter is to control misalignments of the strapdown analytical platform, since analysis has indicated that these errors are dominant contributors to motion compensation error. Representative results from processing raw recorded flight data have verified the proper operation of all aspects of the Kalman filter and have indicated that the filter performance is consistent with the motion compensation requirements. Some examples of actual SAR strip-map imagery are shown in order to demonstrate the enhancement provided by the SARMCS.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/PLANS.1988.195492","publicationTitle":"IEEE PLANS '88.,Position Location and Navigation Symposium, Record.

It differs in that both the lineal bit density and the track density are parameters that may be varied, as opposed to just track density. Using typical media parameters, it is estimated that, for this model, the channel capacity (in bits per unit area) may be increased up to a factor of approximately 20 by appropriately increasing the lineal and track densities.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/20.195548","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","startPage":"59","endPage":"66","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel1/20/5024/00195548.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/20.195548","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5024","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Upper bounds on the capacity of the digital magnetic recording channel","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Upper bound","Digital magnetic recording","Channel capacity","Magnetic separation","Additive noise","Gaussian noise","Magnetic devices","Nonlinear filters","Magnetic noise","Parameter estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel capacity","magnetic disc storage","magnetic recording","noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electronic noise","upper bounds","digital magnetic recording channel","channel capacity","model","linear filter","Lorentzian step response","additive Gaussian noise processes","media noises"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1993","displayDocTitle":"Upper bounds on the capacity of the digital magnetic recording channel","volume":"29","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4414277","publicationDate":"Jan. 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/195548/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Upper bounds on the capacity of the digital magnetic recording channel","sourcePdf":"00195548.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.03316S","chronDate":"Jan.  1993","isNumber":"5024","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"9","articleId":"195548","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":195557,"authors":[{"name":"Z.Q.

Both synchronous and asynchronous variants are based on multiple traveling waves of high-amplitude magnetic fields that have multiple velocities. The authors present a finite element formulation of the diffusion problem for time-harmonic excitation with several different frequencies. In this formulation, phasorial quantities are used and a complex-variable functional treatment is set down to correspond to the electromagnetic partial differential equations. The treatment is applicable to the self-excitation process in fast transient regimes of pulsed discharge of an asynchronous generator in which the nonuniformity (spatial and temporal) of the traveling waves plays an important role.

This scheme is suitable for control of inverters in distributed source environments such as in isolated AC systems, large and distributed uninterruptible power supply (UPS) systems, photovoltaic systems connected to AC grids, and low-voltage DC power transmission meshes. A key feature of the control scheme is that it uses feedback of only those variables that can be measured locally at the inverter and does not need communication of control signals between the inverters. This is essential for the operation of large AC systems, where distances between inverters make communication impractical. It is also important in high-reliability UPS systems where system operation can be maintained in the face of a communication breakdown. Real and reactive power sharing between inverters can be achieved by controlling two independent quantities: the power angle and the fundamental inverter voltage magnitude. Simulation results are presented.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/28.195899","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","pdfPath":"/iel1/28/5026/00195899.pdf","startPage":"136","endPage":"143","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5026","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/28.195899","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Control of parallel connected inverters in standalone AC supply systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=195899","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan/Feb 1993","displayDocTitle":"Control of parallel connected inverters in standalone AC supply systems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/195899/","publicationDate":"Jan.-Feb. 1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4389354","volume":"29","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan/Feb 1993","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Control of parallel connected inverters in standalone AC supply systems","sourcePdf":"00195899.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.024622S","chronDate":"Jan/Feb 1993","isNumber":"5026","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"28","citationCount":"1093","articleId":"195899","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":195900,"authors":[{"name":"F.Z.

By selecting voltage vectors of PWM inverters appropriately, control with decoupling of the thrust and attractive force is achieved. Levitation control is accomplished by detecting the gap length and controlling the attractive force of each linear induction motor. Ultrasonic wave sensors allow stoppage of the vehicle at any desired position using modified sliding-mode control. Decoupling control was experimentally confirmed for the module. The fluctuation of the gap length for step change of the thrust was less than 0.1 mm. The module is judged to be suitable for low-speed vehicles, such as those found in urban transit systems.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan/Feb 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/195902/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan/Feb 1993","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4389357","volume":"29","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan.-Feb. 1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Decoupling control of thrust and attractive force of a LIM using a space vector control inverter","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Decoupling control of thrust and attractive force of a LIM using a space vector control inverter","sourcePdf":"00195902.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.054298S","chronDate":"Jan/Feb 1993","isNumber":"5026","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"28","citationCount":"134","articleId":"195902","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":195904,"authors":[{"name":"H.

Physical design refers to the process of reducing a structural description of a piece of hardware down to the geometric layout of an integrated circuit. Successful physical design tools must cope with shifting technology and application environments. The authors describe a synthesis architecture that combines knowledge of the application domain and knowledge of generic programming mechanics. The approach uses a very high-level language to describe algorithms, domain and programming knowledge to select appropriate algorithms and data structures, and code generation to arrive at final executable code. Results are presented detailing the performance and implementation of ELF, a prototype generator for wire-routing applications. Comparisons between a hand-crafted router and an automatically synthesized router are presented.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/CAIA.1988.196088","publicationTitle":"[1988] Proceedings.

This explanation-based learning technique uses a domain-independent theorem prover and domain-dependent models to explain why a particular design refinement is preferred over alternative refinements. Generalization of this explanation is accomplished by turning constants to variables, dropping common subexpressions from the explanation, and promoting lone subexpressions. The resulting preference rules are general enough to be correctly applied in several different situations. It is asserted that automating the learning of preference rules will make knowledge acquisition easier, reduce the cognitive load on the VLSI designer, and improve the performance of the design problem-solving system.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/CAIA.1988.196096","publicationTitle":"[1988] Proceedings.

A general, two-step approach is presented. First, time correlation and space-varying background structure are removed. Second, a large, dense set of pixel-sized space-time trajectories are hypothesized and tested in the innovations sequence. The search space is organized into a tree structure.

Past edge motion is propagated ahead of the moving edge along the trajectory; this information is then used to evaluate current motion measurements and compute important feature properties. Two related temporal image features are presented. Temporal persistence is the period of time over which a spatial feature has stably persisted in the image plane. Consistent edge motion occurs when an edge moves in a manner which is consistent with its previous trajectory. These temporal features are important to object recognition because spatial structures which persist in a stable manner over time are likely to be structurally related to objects.

The ALV vision task consists of hypothesizing objects in a scene model and verifying these hypotheses using the vehicles sensors. Object hypothesis generation is based on the local navigation task, and a priori road map, and the contents of the scene model. Verification of an object hypothesis involves directing the sensors toward the expected location of the object, collecting evidence in support of the object, and reasoning about the evidence. Constructing the scene model consists of building a semantic network of object frames exhibiting component, spatial, and inheritance relationships. The control structure is provided by a set of communicating production systems implementing a structured blackboard; each production system contains the rules for defining the attributes of a particular class of object frame.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings CVPR '88: The Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel2/206/5032/00196329.pdf","startPage":"826","endPage":"831","publicationTitle":"Proceedings CVPR '88: The Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.1988.196329","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.1988.196329","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5032","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=196329","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An expert vision system for autonomous land vehicle road following","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Machine vision","Land vehicles","Roads","Layout","Navigation","Production systems","Problem-solving","Remotely operated vehicles","Buildings","Control systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["artificial intelligence","computer vision","computerised navigation","computerised pattern recognition","expert systems","robots"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computerised navigation","computer vision","computerised pattern recognition","mobile robots","expert vision system","autonomous land vehicle","road following","production-system model","problem solving","scene model","reasoning","semantic network","structured blackboard"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/196329/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-9 Jun 1988","displayDocTitle":"An expert vision system for autonomous land vehicle road following","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1988","accessionNumber":"3248027","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"5-9 June 1988","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An expert vision system for autonomous land vehicle road following","confLoc":"Ann Arbor, MI, USA","sourcePdf":"00196329.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055399S","chronDate":"5-9 Jun 1988","isNumber":"5032","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"206","citationCount":"2","articleId":"196329","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1988","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-11"},{"_id":196335,"authors":[{"name":"L.W.

The goal is to recognize two-dimensional objects in a scene, given a reasonably large database of known objects. The system uses massively parallel hypotheses generation and parameter space clustering in place of serial constraint propagation. Local boundary features that constrain an object's position and orientation provide a basis for hypothesis generation. Parameter space clustering of hypotheses is used to rank hypotheses according to preliminary evidence prior to verification. This greatly reduces the time for recognition and number of hypotheses that must be tested. Experiments show that the time required by this approach scales at a much slower range than either the number of objects in the database or objects in the scene.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Object recognition using the Connection Machine","publicationTitle":"Proceedings CVPR '88: The Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.1988.196335","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings CVPR '88: The Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel2/206/5032/00196335.pdf","startPage":"871","endPage":"878","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.1988.196335","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5032","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=196335","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/196335/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-9 Jun 1988","displayDocTitle":"Object recognition using the Connection Machine","conferenceDate":"5-9 June 1988","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1988","accessionNumber":"3248031","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Object recognition using the Connection Machine","confLoc":"Ann Arbor, MI, USA","sourcePdf":"00196335.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.091861S","chronDate":"5-9 Jun 1988","isNumber":"5032","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"206","citationCount":"21","articleId":"196335","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1988","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-28"},{"_id":196336,"authors":[{"name":"T.A.

Object models and image data are represented as contour features. Transformation sampling is used to determine the optimal model-feature-to-image-feature transformation by sampling the space of possible transformations. Only a small part of this space need actually be sampled due to the constraints placed on transformations by individual matches of image features to model features. The procedure requires O(Kmn) processors and O(log/sup 2/ (Kmn)) time, where m is the number of model features, n is the number of image features, and K depends on the size of the image. The procedure works well and is extremely robust in the presence of occlusion.

Hidden Markov theory permits modeling with any of the classical probability distributions. The costs of implementation are linear in the length of data. Models can be nested to reflect hierarchical sources of knowledge. These and other desirable features have made hidden Markov methods increasingly attractive for problems in language, speech and signal processing. The basic ideas are introduced by elementary examples in the spirit of the Polya urn models. The main tool in hidden Markov modeling is the Baum-Welch (or forward-backward) algorithm for maximum likelihood estimation of the model parameters. This iterative algorithm is discussed both from an intuitive point of view as an exercise in the art of counting and from a formal point of view via the information-theoretic Q-function. Selected examples drawn from the literature illustrate how the Baum-Welch technique places a rich variety of computational models at the disposal of the researcher.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1988.196495","publicationTitle":"ICASSP-88., International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"ICASSP-88., International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel2/723/5035/00196495.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1988.196495","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5035","startPage":"7","endPage":"13 vol.1","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hidden Markov models: a guided tour","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=196495","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Hidden Markov models: a guided tour","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Apr 1988","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/196495/","conferenceDate":"11-14 April 1988","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1988","accessionNumber":"3238298","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hidden Markov models: a guided tour","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"00196495.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.103939S","chronDate":"11-14 Apr 1988","isNumber":"5035","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"723","citationCount":"110","articleId":"196495","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1988","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":196499,"authors":[{"name":"P.S.

The authors model probabilities of hidden state sequences as Gibbs distributions (GDs) instead of the conventional products of transition probabilities. This formulation is based on the Hammersley-Clifford theorem which establishes the equivalence between Markov random fields (MRF) and GDs. The Markov chains in HMM are equivalent to one-dimensional, first order neighborhood MRFs. The observation sequences are modeled by the usual autoregressive Gaussian densities. The flexibility in the choice of energy functions in GDs makes it possible to use only a few parameters while maintaining a powerful model. The authors have developed a learning algorithm to estimate the parameters using maximum likelihood estimation and an algorithm to efficiently compute 1-D, first order neighborhood GDs using a lattice structure.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"ICASSP-88., International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel2/723/5035/00196501.pdf","startPage":"28","endPage":"31 vol.1","publicationTitle":"ICASSP-88., International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1988.196501","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1988.196501","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5035","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=196501","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Application of the Gibbs distribution to hidden Markov modeling in isolated word recognition","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hidden Markov models","Power system modeling","Parameter estimation","Maximum likelihood estimation","Lattices","Interactive systems","Laboratories","Markov random fields","Image texture","Image restoration"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Markov processes","series (mathematics)","speech recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["speech recognition","Gibbs distribution","hidden Markov models","isolated word recognition","hidden state sequences","Hammersley-Clifford theorem","Markov random fields","Markov chains","observation sequences","autoregressive Gaussian densities","energy functions","maximum likelihood estimation","lattice structure"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/196501/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Apr 1988","displayDocTitle":"Application of the Gibbs distribution to hidden Markov modeling in isolated word recognition","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1988","accessionNumber":"3238302","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"11-14 April 1988","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Application of the Gibbs distribution to hidden Markov modeling in isolated word recognition","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"00196501.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046738S","chronDate":"11-14 Apr 1988","isNumber":"5035","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"723","articleId":"196501","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1988","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":196503,"authors":[{"name":"D.

Their consideration focuses on the speech cepstrum derived from linear prediction coefficients (the LPC cepstrum). By using common models for noisy speech, they analytically and empirically show how the ambient noise can affect some important attributes of the LPC cepstrum such as the vector norm, coefficient order, and the direction perturbation. The new findings led them to propose a family of distortion measures based on the projection between two cepstral vectors. Performance evaluation of these measures has been conducted in both speaker-dependent and speaker-independent isolated word recognition tasks. Experimental results show that the new measures cause no degradation in recognition accuracy at high SNR, but perform significantly better when tested under noisy conditions using only clean reference templates. At an SNR of 5 dB, the new measures are shown to be able to achieve a recognition rate equivalent to that obtained by the filtered cepstral measure at 20 dB SNR, demonstrating a gain of 15 dB.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/196503/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Apr 1988","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1988","accessionNumber":"3238304","conferenceDate":"11-14 April 1988","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A family of distortion measures base upon projection operation for robust speech recognition","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A family of distortion measures base upon projection operation for robust speech recognition","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"00196503.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.099842S","chronDate":"11-14 Apr 1988","isNumber":"5035","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"723","citationCount":"15","articleId":"196503","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1988","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":196504,"authors":[{"name":"L.R.

This problem is to design a speech-recognition system which can extract from the speech waveform as much information as possible about the corresponding word sequence. The information extraction process is factored into two steps: a signal-processing step which converts a speech waveform into a sequence of informative acoustic feature vectors, and a step which models such a sequence. The authors are primarily concerned with the use of hidden Markov models to model sequences of feature vectors which lie in a continuous space. They explore the trade-off between packing information into such sequences and being able to model them accurately. The difficulty of developing accurate models of continuous-parameter sequences is addressed by investigating a method of parameter estimation which is designed to cope with inaccurate modeling assumptions.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/196504/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Apr 1988","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"11-14 April 1988","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1988","accessionNumber":"3238305","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Speech recognition with continuous-parameter hidden Markov models","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Speech recognition with continuous-parameter hidden Markov models","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"00196504.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060065S","chronDate":"11-14 Apr 1988","isNumber":"5035","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"723","citationCount":"12","articleId":"196504","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1988","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-28"},{"_id":196505,"authors":[{"name":"G.

These procedures would use automatic speech recognition (ASR) to give users of 'O/sup +/' calls the option of verbally identifying the type of call they wish to make. The goal of these studies were of a particular training set to assess the performance of current ASR algorithms, both template-based and hidden Markov model based, on speech data collected over the DDD network. Over the course of the trial, upwards of 75000 caller responses were recorded on Sony PCM-F1 recording equipment.

When both voiced and voiceless CV types were learned together by a one-speaker system, consonant performance dropped to just over 80 percent.

Therefore, an analysis is required which will make the important features of the neural firing patterns explicit, but which will describe them concisely and without disruption by known characteristics of speech. Several attempts have been made to develop such an analysis, however, such analyses ignore significant aspects of neural firing patterns, and consequently information is lost (usually that associated with fine temporal structure). The authors describe a 'reduced auditory representation', which retains more information, and presents the results of preliminary recognition experiments using this data.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"ICASSP-88., International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel2/723/5035/00196514.pdf","startPage":"75","endPage":"78 vol.1","publicationTitle":"ICASSP-88., International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1988.196514","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1988.196514","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5035","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=196514","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improved speech recognition using a reduced auditory representation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Speech recognition","Pattern analysis","Biomembranes","Signal analysis","Speech analysis","Information analysis","Nonlinear equations","Frequency estimation","Radar","Pattern recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["speech recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["speech recognition","reduced auditory representation","speech signal","neural firing patterns","fine temporal structure","preliminary recognition experiments"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/196514/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Apr 1988","displayDocTitle":"Improved speech recognition using a reduced auditory representation","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1988","accessionNumber":"3238314","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"11-14 April 1988","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improved speech recognition using a reduced auditory representation","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"00196514.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.028345S","chronDate":"11-14 Apr 1988","isNumber":"5035","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"723","articleId":"196514","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1988","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":196520,"authors":[{"name":"W.

By the use of two hidden layers in addition to an input and output layer it is capable of representing complex nonlinear decision surfaces. Three important properties of the TDNNs have been observed. First, it was able to invent without human interference meaningful linguistic abstractions in time and frequency such as formant tracking and segmentation. Second, it has learned to form alternate representations linking different acoustic events with the same higher level concept. In this fashion it can implement trading relations between lower level acoustic events leading to robust recognition performance despite considerable variability in the input speech. Third, the network is translation-invariant and does not rely on precise alignment or segmentation of the input. The TDNNs performance is compared with the best of hidden Markov models (HMMs) on a speaker-dependent phoneme-recognition task. The TDNN achieved a recognition of 98.5% compared to 93.7% for the HMM, i.e., a fourfold reduction in error.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1988.196523","publicationTitle":"ICASSP-88., International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"ICASSP-88., International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel2/723/5035/00196523.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1988.196523","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5035","startPage":"107","endPage":"110 vol.1","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Phoneme recognition: neural networks vs. hidden Markov models vs. hidden Markov models","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=196523","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Phoneme recognition: neural networks vs. hidden Markov models vs. hidden Markov models","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Apr 1988","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/196523/","conferenceDate":"11-14 April 1988","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1988","accessionNumber":"3238322","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Phoneme recognition: neural networks vs. hidden Markov models vs. hidden Markov models","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"00196523.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.03282S","chronDate":"11-14 Apr 1988","isNumber":"5035","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"723","citationCount":"59","articleId":"196523","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1988","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":196524,"authors":[{"name":"B.

The adaptive codebook quantization is similar to a closed-loop long-term prediction filter if the predictor delay is more than one frame length. The performance of the adaptive codebook procedure is improved by extending its codebook to include candidate vectors constructed from past synthetic excitation displaying a high level of periodicity. An algorithm is introduced which through increased symmetry of the error criterion significantly reduces the computational effort required for the search through the adaptive codebook. The algorithm can also be used for stochastic codebooks consisting of overlapping candidate vectors.

The first step, hypothesization, consists in the selection of a subset of word candidates, starting from the segmentation of speech into six broad phonetic classes. This module is implemented through a dynamic programming algorithm working in a three-dimensional space. The search is performed on a tree representing a coarse description of the lexicon. The second step is the search for the best N candidates according to a maximum-likelihood criterion. Each word candidate is represented by a graph of subword hidden Markov models, and a tree structure of the whole word subset is built on line for an efficient implementation of the Viterbi algorithm. A comparison with a direct approach that does not use the hypothesization module shows that the two-pass approach has the same performance with an 80% reduction in computational complexity.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1988.196549","publicationTitle":"ICASSP-88., International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"ICASSP-88., International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel2/723/5035/00196549.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1988.196549","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5035","startPage":"203","endPage":"206 vol.1","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Very large vocabulary isolated utterance recognition: a comparison between one pass and two pass strategies","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=196549","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Very large vocabulary isolated utterance recognition: a comparison between one pass and two pass strategies","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Apr 1988","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/196549/","conferenceDate":"11-14 April 1988","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1988","accessionNumber":"3238346","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Very large vocabulary isolated utterance recognition: a comparison between one pass and two pass strategies","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"00196549.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045221S","chronDate":"11-14 Apr 1988","isNumber":"5035","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"723","citationCount":"4","articleId":"196549","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1988","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":196550,"authors":[{"name":"M.

This is estimated by counting the correspondences along the alignment between a state sequence of an HMM and a label sequence of a new speaker utterance. This adaptation procedure was tested in an isolated word recognition task using 150 confusable Japanese words. The original label prototypes and HMM parameters were estimated for a male speaker, who spoke each word 10 times. When the adaptation procedure was applied with 25 words, the average error rate for another seven male speakers was reduced from 25.0% to 5.6%, which was roughly the same as that for the original speaker.

The algorithm and the experimental implementations based on different VLSI signal processors are described and demonstrated.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1988.196556","displayPublicationTitle":"ICASSP-88., International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel2/723/5035/00196556.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5035","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1988.196556","publicationTitle":"ICASSP-88., International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","startPage":"227","endPage":"230 vol.1","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Speech codec for the European mobile radio system","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=196556","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Apr 1988","displayDocTitle":"Speech codec for the European mobile radio system","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/196556/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1988","accessionNumber":"3238352","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"11-14 April 1988","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Speech codec for the European mobile radio system","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"00196556.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.024549S","chronDate":"11-14 Apr 1988","isNumber":"5035","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"723","citationCount":"46","articleId":"196556","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1988","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":196558,"authors":[{"name":"R.V.

It is structured in such a way that the relative importance of all bits is established as a byproduct of the dynamic bit allocation. It is shown that there is a difference in error sensitivity of four orders of magnitude between the most and the least important bits of the bit stream on average. A very flexible unequal error protection scheme is used to match the error sensitivity of the sub-band coder bit stream. This is accomplished using the concept of rate compatible punctured convolutional coding. The resulting coder gives robust performance over a simulated noisy channel. Its nominal bit rate is 16 kb/s, with 12 kb/s assigned for speech coding and 4 kb/s assigned for error correction. The entire encoder and decoder have been implemented on a single AT&T DSP-32 digital signal processor.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1988.196558","publicationTitle":"ICASSP-88., International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"ICASSP-88., International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel2/723/5035/00196558.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1988.196558","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5035","startPage":"235","endPage":"238 vol.1","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A sub-band coder designed for combined source and channel coding (speech coding)","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=196558","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A sub-band coder designed for combined source and channel coding (speech coding)","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Apr 1988","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/196558/","conferenceDate":"11-14 April 1988","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1988","accessionNumber":"3238354","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A sub-band coder designed for combined source and channel coding (speech coding)","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"00196558.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.028031S","chronDate":"11-14 Apr 1988","isNumber":"5035","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"723","citationCount":"21","articleId":"196558","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1988","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":196559,"authors":[{"name":"H.G.

The first step consists in the hypothesization of a reduced set of word candidates on the basis of broad bottom-up features, while the second one is the verification of the hypotheses using more detailed phonetic knowledge. This paper deals with its extension to continuous speech. A tight integration between the two steps rather than a hierarchical approach has been investigated. The hypothesization and the verification modules are implemented as processes running in parallel. Both processes represent lexical knowledge by a tree. Each node of the hypothesization tree is labeled by one of 6 broad phonetic classes. The nodes of the verification tree are, instead, the states of sub-word HMMs. The two processes cooperate to detect word hypotheses along the sentence.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","publicationTitle":"ICASSP-88., International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"ICASSP-88., International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel2/723/5035/00196570.pdf","startPage":"279","endPage":"282 vol.1","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Interaction between fast lexical access and word verification in large vocabulary continuous speech recognition","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1988.196570","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5035","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1988.196570","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=196570","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/196570/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Apr 1988","displayDocTitle":"Interaction between fast lexical access and word verification in large vocabulary continuous speech recognition","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1988","accessionNumber":"3238365","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"11-14 April 1988","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Interaction between fast lexical access and word verification in large vocabulary continuous speech recognition","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"00196570.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063765S","chronDate":"11-14 Apr 1988","isNumber":"5035","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"723","citationCount":"8","articleId":"196570","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1988","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":196571,"authors":[{"name":"D.B.

Previous frame synchronous approaches to recognition have included the one-pass approach, the one-stage approach, and an unpublished multilevel approach. The proposed algorithm, which has all the features of these earlier methods, as well as several new features, and which is implemented in a network-based approach, is a numerically exact, frame synchronous, implementation of the conventional level building (LB) algorithm. As with some of the earlier methods, the proposed algorithm is highly regular and modularized for distributed computation among several spectral purpose processors. New features of the algorithm include the capability of determining the best alternative recognition strings (e.g. second and third best strings), at every level, even for very complicated grammar networks, and the capability of efficiently incorporating several word and state duration scoring techniques directly in the forward search thereby eliminating the need for a postprocessor as required in the direct LB implementation. Word transition rules (e.g. a language model) can also be easily incorporated into the proposed algorithm.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/196605/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Apr 1988","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"1988","accessionNumber":"3257054","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"11-14 April 1988","isConference":true,"displayDocTitle":"A network-based frame-synchronous level building algorithm for connected word recognition","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A network-based frame-synchronous level building algorithm for connected word recognition","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"00196605.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048528S","chronDate":"11-14 Apr 1988","isNumber":"5035","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"723","citationCount":"7","articleId":"196605","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1988","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":196606,"authors":[{"name":"L.

A lattice of word candidates hypothesized by the speaker dependent recognition level is the interface to an understanding module that performs the syntactic and semantic analysis. The recognition subsystem generates word hypotheses by exploiting hidden Markov models of sub-word units. Bottom-up constraints are also introduced to restrict the set of candidate words. The understanding module determines the most likely sequence of words and represents its meaning in a parse-tree suitable to access a database. It makes use of a modified caseframe analysis driven by the word hypotheses likelihood scores.

Tests with real data confirm the reliability of the end-point method and the presence of positive bias in performance estimates form the word-sequence matching method.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/196617/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Apr 1988","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"1988","accessionNumber":"3257066","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"11-14 April 1988","isConference":true,"displayDocTitle":"Evaluating the performance of connected-word speech recognition systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Evaluating the performance of connected-word speech recognition systems","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"00196617.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070125S","chronDate":"11-14 Apr 1988","isNumber":"5035","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"723","citationCount":"6","articleId":"196617","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1988","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":196622,"authors":[{"name":"S.C.

A HMM has been derived, which treats sequence observations as a whole and not as a series of independent random variables. The model is based upon a distortion measure, which compares observations against templates contained in the model. From a sequence of observations, a typical distortion is computed and this is used to match a test utterance to the model, the utterance being regarded as a string of observation sequences corresponding to state occupancies. In addition, the length of a sequence is modelled explicitly. The natures of the duration model and distortion measure are left undefined in order to accommodate alternative parameterisations of the speech. In the training algorithm, the task of re-estimating the parameters is reduced to simple subsidiary problems.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Frame compression in hidden Markov models","publicationTitle":"ICASSP-88., International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1988.196622","displayPublicationTitle":"ICASSP-88., International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel2/723/5035/00196622.pdf","startPage":"477","endPage":"480 vol.1","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1988.196622","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5035","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=196622","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/196622/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Apr 1988","displayDocTitle":"Frame compression in hidden Markov models","conferenceDate":"11-14 April 1988","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1988","accessionNumber":"3257071","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Frame compression in hidden Markov models","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"00196622.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.024102S","chronDate":"11-14 Apr 1988","isNumber":"5035","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"723","citationCount":"3","articleId":"196622","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1988","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":196623,"authors":[{"name":"A.

An approach called polling is advocated, in which each label produced by the vector quantizer casts a varying, real-valed vote for each word in the vocabulary. The words receiving the highest votes are placed on a short list to be matched in detail at a later stage of processing. Expressions are derived for these votes under the assumption that for any given word, the observed label frequencies have Poisson distributions. Although the method is more general, particular attention is paid to the implementation of polling in speech recognition systems which use hidden Markov models during the acoustic match computation. Results are presented of experiments with speaker-dependent and speaker-independent Markov models on two different isolated word recognition tasks.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/196626/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Apr 1988","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1988","accessionNumber":"3257074","conferenceDate":"11-14 April 1988","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Obtaining candidate words by polling in a large vocabulary speech recognition system","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Obtaining candidate words by polling in a large vocabulary speech recognition system","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"00196626.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052839S","chronDate":"11-14 Apr 1988","isNumber":"5035","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"723","citationCount":"11","articleId":"196626","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1988","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-28"},{"_id":196627,"authors":[{"name":"L.R.

The authors argue that maximum-likelihood estimation of the parameters does not lead to values which maximize recognition accuracy and describe an alternative estimation procedure called corrective training which is aimed at minimizing the number of recognition errors. Corrective training is similar to a well-known error-correcting training procedure for linear classifiers and works by iteratively adjusting the parameter values so as to make correct words more probable and incorrect words less probable. There are also strong parallels between corrective training and maximum mutual information estimation. They do not prove that the corrective training algorithm converges, but experimental evidence suggests that it does, and that it leads to significantly fewer recognition errors than maximum likelihood estimation.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"ICASSP-88., International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel2/723/5035/00196627.pdf","startPage":"493","endPage":"497 vol.1","publicationTitle":"ICASSP-88., International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1988.196627","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1988.196627","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5035","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=196627","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new algorithm for the estimation of hidden Markov model parameters","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hidden Markov models","Error analysis","Training data","Speech recognition","Maximum likelihood estimation","Statistics","Error correction","Convergence","Iterative algorithms","Frequency estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Markov processes","speech recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hidden Markov model parameters","speech recognition","recognition accuracy","error-correcting training","linear classifiers","maximum mutual information estimation","corrective training algorithm"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/196627/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Apr 1988","displayDocTitle":"A new algorithm for the estimation of hidden Markov model parameters","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1988","accessionNumber":"3257075","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"11-14 April 1988","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new algorithm for the estimation of hidden Markov model parameters","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"00196627.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047338S","chronDate":"11-14 Apr 1988","isNumber":"5035","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"723","citationCount":"56","articleId":"196627","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1988","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-28"},{"_id":196628,"authors":[{"name":"L.R.

An acoustically-derived lexicon is used to construct word models based upon subword segment models. The proposed segment model was tested on a speaker-trained, isolated word, speech recognition task with a vocabulary of 1109 basic English words. In the current study, only 128 segment models were used, and recognition was performed by optimally aligning the test utterance with all acoustic lexicon entries using a maximum likelihood Viterbi decoding algorithm.

The system comprises an acoustic/phonetic decoder, a lexical access mechanism and a syntax analyzer. The acoustic, phonetic and lexical processing are based on a continuously variable duration hidden Markov model (CVDHMM). The syntactic component is based on the Cocke-Kasami-Young (CKY) parser and a content-free covering grammar of English. Lexical items are represented in terms of the 43 phonetic units. In recognition tests conducted on a separate data set, a 70% correct recognition rate on phonetic units in fluent speech was observed.

Each component of the mixture is regarded as a prototype for the labeling phase of a hidden Markov model based speech recognition system. Since the ambient noise during recognition can differ from the ambient noise present in the training data, the model is designed for convenient updating in changing noise. Based on the observation that the energy in a frequency band is at any fixed time dominated either by signal energy or by noise energy, the authors model the energy as the larger of the separate energies of signal and noise in the band. Statistical algorithms are given for training this as a hidden variables model. The hidden variables are the prototype identities and the separate signal and noise components. A series of speech recognition experiments that successfully utilize this model is also discussed.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/196633/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Apr 1988","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1988","accessionNumber":"3257081","conferenceDate":"11-14 April 1988","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Speech recognition using noise-adaptive prototypes","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Speech recognition using noise-adaptive prototypes","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"00196633.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.027673S","chronDate":"11-14 Apr 1988","isNumber":"5035","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"723","citationCount":"12","articleId":"196633","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1988","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-28"},{"_id":196643,"authors":[{"name":"S.

Results show improvement over past techniques for additive white noise distortions. Three points are addressed in the present study. First, a convenient and consistent terminating point for the iterative technique is presented which was previously unavailable. Second, the techniques have been generalized to allow for slowly varying, colored noise. Finally, a comparative evaluation has been performed to determine their usefulness as preprocessors for recognition in extremely noisy environments in the vicinity of 0 dB SNR.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/196645/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Apr 1988","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"1988","accessionNumber":"3257092","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"11-14 April 1988","isConference":true,"displayDocTitle":"Constrained iterative speech enhancement with application to automatic speech recognition","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Constrained iterative speech enhancement with application to automatic speech recognition","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"00196645.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.02162S","chronDate":"11-14 Apr 1988","isNumber":"5035","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"723","citationCount":"18","articleId":"196645","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1988","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":196646,"authors":[{"name":"T.F.

Enhancement is achieved by synthesizing a waveform from the sine waves attributed to the desired speaker. Least squares estimation is applied to obtain sine-wave amplitudes and phases for both talkers, based on either a priori sine-wave frequencies or a priori fundamental frequency contours. When the frequencies of the two waveforms are closely spaced, the performance is significantly improved by exploiting the time evolution of the sinusoidal parameters across multiple analysis frames. The least squares error approach is also extended to estimate fundamental frequency contours of both speakers from the summed waveform. The results obtained, though limited in their scope, provide evidence that the sinusoidal analysis/synthesis model with effective parameter estimation techniques offers a promising approach to the problem of cochannel talker interference suppression over a range of conditions.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/196646/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Apr 1988","conferenceDate":"11-14 April 1988","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1988","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"3257093","displayDocTitle":"An approach to co-channel talker interference suppression using a sinusoidal model for speech","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An approach to co-channel talker interference suppression using a sinusoidal model for speech","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"00196646.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.029649S","chronDate":"11-14 Apr 1988","isNumber":"5035","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"723","citationCount":"4","articleId":"196646","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1988","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":196669,"authors":[{"name":"P.

In this synthesis system, all phoneme subsequences in each synthesis unit are also used as synthesis units. To facilitate the search for appropriate unit candidates, the phoneme sequence entry dictionary is made for a given speech set. Using this entry dictionary, all candidate unit templates are listed for a given input phoneme string. The most appropriate one is selected based on an appropriateness measure.

The compression efficiency of PCC is attributed primarily to use of this syntax. Examples are given showing comparisons of coding efficiency for different coding schemes. Advantage is taken of PCC's compact and feature-based code for aid in image analysis. PCC is described as the lowest level of the thin line code (TLC).

For English text, which is the focus of the present research, the states can be identified with the letters of the alphabet, and the optimum symbols can be generated. In order to do so, a quantitative definition of symbols, in terms of features, is required. Fourteen features (some old, some new) are proposed for this task. Using the existing statistical knowledge about the English language, the calculation of the model parameters is immensely simplified. Once the model is established, the Viterbi algorithm is proposed to recognize the single best optimal state sequence, i.e. sequence of letters comprising the word. The modification of the recognition algorithm to accommodate context information is also discussed. Some experimental results are provided indicating the success of the new scheme.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"ICASSP-88., International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel2/723/5035/00196741.pdf","startPage":"928","endPage":"931 vol.2","publicationTitle":"ICASSP-88., International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1988.196741","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1988.196741","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5035","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=196741","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Recognition of handwritten script: a hidden Markov model based approach","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Handwriting recognition","Hidden Markov models","Pattern recognition","Character recognition","Random processes","Stochastic processes","Natural languages","Optical character recognition software","Vocabulary","Cryptography"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Markov processes","pattern recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["symbol definition","pattern recognition","hidden Markov model","handwritten script recognition","English text","optimum symbols","features","statistical knowledge","Viterbi algorithm","optimal state sequence","recognition algorithm"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/196741/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Apr 1988","displayDocTitle":"Recognition of handwritten script: a hidden Markov model based approach","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1988","accessionNumber":"3227940","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"11-14 April 1988","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Recognition of handwritten script: a hidden Markov model based approach","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"00196741.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041852S","chronDate":"11-14 Apr 1988","isNumber":"5035","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"723","citationCount":"20","articleId":"196741","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1988","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":196745,"authors":[{"name":"Y.T.

Computer simulations to demonstrate the efficacy of the method are presented.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1988.196745","pdfPath":"/iel2/723/5035/00196745.pdf","startPage":"940","endPage":"943 vol.2","displayPublicationTitle":"ICASSP-88., International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","publicationTitle":"ICASSP-88., International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1988.196745","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5035","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Stereo matching using a neural network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/196745/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Apr 1988","displayDocTitle":"Stereo matching using a neural network","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"3238425","publicationDate":"1988","conferenceDate":"11-14 April 1988","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Stereo matching using a neural network","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"00196745.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065256S","chronDate":"11-14 Apr 1988","isNumber":"5035","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"723","citationCount":"22","articleId":"196745","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1988","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":196775,"authors":[{"name":"F.

This multiple resolution method results in accurate segmentations and requires significantly less computation than some previously known methods. The segmentation algorithm used at each resolution is based on maximum a posteriori estimation of the field of pixel classifications, which is modeled as a Markov random field. The maximization is performed by a deterministic greedy algorithm which iteratively chooses the classification of individual pixels or blocks of pixels. A texture model is also developed which allows the extraction of a texture statistic for each pixel and is well suited for use with the proposed algorithm.

However, this algorithm easily gets trapped in local minima of the distortion, resulting in a suboptimal codebook. Simulated annealing is a procedure that uses randomness in a search algorithm and tends to skirt relatively poor local minima in favor of better ones.

Reference is made to a method for dealing with transient signals which has recently appeared in the literature. The basis functions are referred to as wavelets, and they utilize time compression (or dilation) rather than a variation of frequency of the modulated sinusoid. Hence, all the wavelets have the same number of cycles. The analyzing wavelets must satisfy a few simple conditions, but are not otherwise specified. There is a wide latitude in the choice of these functions and they can be tailored to specific applications. The wavelets are founded on rigorous mathematical theory, and the expansions are robust. They are applied to detect ventricular delayed potentials (VLP) in the electrocardiogram.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1988.196869","publicationTitle":"ICASSP-88., International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"ICASSP-88., International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel2/723/5035/00196869.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1988.196869","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5035","startPage":"1435","endPage":"1438 vol.3","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Wavelet transformations in signal detection","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=196869","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Wavelet transformations in signal detection","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Apr 1988","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/196869/","conferenceDate":"11-14 April 1988","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1988","accessionNumber":"3257193","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wavelet transformations in signal detection","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"00196869.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.035575S","chronDate":"11-14 Apr 1988","isNumber":"5035","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"723","citationCount":"24","articleId":"196869","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1988","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":196878,"authors":[{"name":"T.Q.

While insufficient word length significantly degrades the performance of the canceller, it is possible to compensate for its effects by using a nonuniform number representation system, i.e. pseudo-floating-point arithmetic. Such an algorithm, using 10 bits, is discussed and its performance is compared with that of ordinary fixed-point algorithms with various number of bits. A multichannel echo-canceller chip has been built using this algorithm.

This method does not utilize the redundancies that exist between the FFTs at different times, which, especially for small time differences, are quite large. A method for computing the STFFT is described which utilizes the redundancy to reduce the number of operations required to compute the STFFT. The reduction depends on the length of the STFFT and the time difference between FFTs. This method is more efficient than the regular FFT method for up to very large time differences.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"ICASSP-88., International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel2/723/5035/00196996.pdf","startPage":"1894","endPage":"1897 vol.3","publicationTitle":"ICASSP-88., International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1988.196996","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1988.196996","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5035","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=196996","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient computation of the short-time fast Fourier transform","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fast Fourier transforms","Discrete Fourier transforms","Flexible printed circuits","Smoothing methods","Speech analysis","Computer applications","Digital signal processing","Signal processing algorithms","Signal analysis","Instruments"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fast Fourier transforms","signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["speech processing","short-time fast Fourier transform","time-varying signal processing","fast Fourier transform","FFT","redundancies","time difference"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/196996/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Apr 1988","displayDocTitle":"Efficient computation of the short-time fast Fourier transform","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1988","accessionNumber":"3257209","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"11-14 April 1988","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient computation of the short-time fast Fourier transform","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"00196996.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.034715S","chronDate":"11-14 Apr 1988","isNumber":"5035","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"723","citationCount":"6","articleId":"196996","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1988","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":196998,"authors":[{"name":"O.K.

General-purpose digital signal processors, with their emphasis on high-speed arithmetic computations, do not adequately serve the needs of adaptive control and similar applications. As an alternative the authors have generated a custom circuit for a cost-effective implementation of the algorithm. The generation of the custom circuit is based on a customizable digital signal processor embedded inside a CAD framework for application-specific ICs. With this approach, customized versions of the processor are automatically generated from high-level descriptions of algorithms.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1988.197024","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1988.197024","displayPublicationTitle":"ICASSP-88., International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel2/723/5035/00197024.pdf","startPage":"2021","endPage":"2024 vol.4","publicationTitle":"ICASSP-88., International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5035","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Automatic generation of a custom digital signal processor for an adaptive robot arm controller","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Automatic generation of a custom digital signal processor for an adaptive robot arm controller","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/197024/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Apr 1988","conferenceDate":"11-14 April 1988","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1988","accessionNumber":"3257235","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automatic generation of a custom digital signal processor for an adaptive robot arm controller","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"00197024.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.032782S","chronDate":"11-14 Apr 1988","isNumber":"5035","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"723","citationCount":"5","articleId":"197024","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1988","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":197025,"authors":[{"name":"J.

The data are sampled N-component vector time series X(n), with components that are time functions observed at N individual antenna ports. The processed output, y(n), is a weighted sum of the components, e.g. W/sup t/X(n). In practice, the author expects to computer W a few hundred times per second, based on observations of many exponentially windowed samples of X which arrive two-orders-of-magnitude more frequently. The algorithm used for determining W is based on the use of Givens transformations to rotate the original data into a lower triangular matrix, after which the desired weights are the solution to a triangular set of linear equations. The computational cost of this algorithm (and of almost all other algorithms which find the optimum weights) increases with N, the number of degrees of freedom, as N/sup 3/, so for sufficiently large N, some degree of parallelism must be used. An advanced architecture which uses N/2 processors connected in a linear chain, suitable for realizing this algorithm for N=64 in a systolic VLSI wafer-scale design, is described.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/197036/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Apr 1988","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"11-14 April 1988","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1988","accessionNumber":"3257247","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Wafer-scale systolic array for adaptive antenna processing","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wafer-scale systolic array for adaptive antenna processing","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"00197036.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.032576S","chronDate":"11-14 Apr 1988","isNumber":"5035","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"723","citationCount":"10","articleId":"197036","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1988","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-28"},{"_id":197039,"authors":[{"name":"G.M.

The authors introduce a new look-ahead approach (referred to as scattered look-ahead) to pipeline recursive filters in a way that guarantees stability. They also propose a decomposition technique to implement the nonrecursive portion (generated due to the scattered look-ahead) in a decomposed manner (for cases where the number of loop pipeline states is a power of two) to obtain pipelined realizations of logarithmic implementation complexity with respect to the number of loop pipeline stages (as opposed to linear).

Noise reduction is achieved by utilizing the directivity gain of the array and by reducing the residual noise through postfiltering of the received microphone signals. The postfiltering scheme depends on a Wiener filter estimating the desired speech signal and is computed from short-term measurements of the autocorrelation and cross-correlation functions of the microphone signals. The noise reduction system has been tested experimentally in a typical office room. The system produces an enhanced speech signal with barely noticeable residual noise if the input SNR is greater than 0 dB. The received noise power-measured in the absence of the speech signal-can be reduced by 28 dB.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1988.197172","publicationTitle":"ICASSP-88., International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"ICASSP-88., International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel2/723/5035/00197172.pdf","startPage":"2578","endPage":"2581 vol.5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1988.197172","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5035","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A microphone array with adaptive post-filtering for noise reduction in reverberant rooms","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=197172","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Apr 1988","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/197172/","displayDocTitle":"A microphone array with adaptive post-filtering for noise reduction in reverberant rooms","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1988","accessionNumber":"3257361","conferenceDate":"11-14 April 1988","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A microphone array with adaptive post-filtering for noise reduction in reverberant rooms","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"00197172.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038538S","chronDate":"11-14 Apr 1988","isNumber":"5035","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"723","citationCount":"182","articleId":"197172","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1988","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-22"},{"_id":197183,"authors":[{"name":"M.

It is demonstrated that at modest signal-to-noise ratio, accuracy reductions in a multiple-source setting depend on the inverse second power of angular spacing when the power levels are known a priori, and on the inverse fourth power if the power levels are unknown a priori. The Cramer-Rao lower bounds cannot be reached, however, if the correct number of sources cannot be determined from the data. This problem is addressed by computing the probability of error in a binary hypothesis test. The results indicate the presence of a threshold below which reachability of the earlier computed bounds is clearly optimistic.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Apr 1988","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/197183/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"3257370","publicationDate":"1988","conferenceDate":"11-14 April 1988","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Bearing resolution limits for broadband signals","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bearing resolution limits for broadband signals","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"00197183.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.034674S","chronDate":"11-14 Apr 1988","isNumber":"5035","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"723","citationCount":"5","articleId":"197183","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1988","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":197195,"authors":[{"name":"D.N.

The number of computations required to perform this decomposition is of the order of O(2N/sup 3//3), while the eigendecomposition requires O(N/sup 4/) computations.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5035","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1988.197263","publicationTitle":"ICASSP-88., International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"ICASSP-88., International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel2/723/5035/00197263.pdf","startPage":"2913","endPage":"2916 vol.5","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1988.197263","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Signal subspace algorithms for direction of arrival estimation in the presence of a class of unknown noise fields","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Apr 1988","displayDocTitle":"Signal subspace algorithms for direction of arrival estimation in the presence of a class of unknown noise fields","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"11-14 April 1988","publicationDate":"1988","accessionNumber":"3257444","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/197263/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Signal subspace algorithms for direction of arrival estimation in the presence of a class of unknown noise fields","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"00197263.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.023988S","chronDate":"11-14 Apr 1988","isNumber":"5035","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"723","citationCount":"8","articleId":"197263","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1988","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":197268,"authors":[{"name":"S.Y.

For the case of white additive noise, the SK-W filter design uses approximately n/sup 2//2 processors and provides a speed-up of n/sup 2//2, with a nearly 100% utilization rate.

The hybrid successfully diagnoses a simulated mechanical fault using acoustic information and expert-level knowledge, demonstrating that a standard low-cost platform can support a combination of neural network, expert system, and data acquisition software. This hybrid technology has potential applications in diagnostics and prognostics applications where the available diagnostic evidence includes both signal and symbolic information.

It was demonstrated that the neural models possess significantly superior performance. Furthermore, the derivation of accurate neural models was shown to require fewer training experiments.

Good control can be achieved at coarse sampling rates by using a 'true digital' design, and proportional-integral-plus is found to be a particularly simple, general purpose, digital control algorithm that works well with coarse sampling. Finally, the load disturbance rejection properties of coarse sampling controllers are investigated, and it is suggested that there is a 'worst case' during the sampling cycle time at which load disturbances can occur.

These codes were designed to commute with the addition operator and the theory is extensive. In digital signal processing applications the bulk of the arithmetic is addition and multiplication, it is therefore interesting to look for codes that commute with both addition and multiplication. It is shown that such a code does in fact exist; an AN code where the code generator A is an idempotent i.e. A/sup 2/=A. This code, unfortunately, has a serious deficiency in that errors can be masked by a fault-free multiplier. Thus no single (non-separate) code is suitable for both addition and multiplication. Motivated by this problem and the fact that AN codes were designed around the addition operator, the characteristics of a code that commutes with multiplication are discussed. A simple code that satisfies these requirements is presented: an AN+B code. The results of some computer simulations of an AN+B coded multiplier are given.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","publicationTitle":"IEE Colloquium on Signal Processing Applications of Finite Field Mathematics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEE Colloquium on Signal Processing Applications of Finite Field Mathematics","pdfPath":"/iel3/1992/5125/00198558.pdf","startPage":"8/1","endPage":"8/5","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5125","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Idempotent AN codes","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IET","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/198558/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-1 June 1989","displayDocTitle":"Idempotent AN codes","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1989","accessionNumber":"3485250","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"1-1 June 1989","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Idempotent AN codes","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"00198558.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.034999S","chronDate":"1-1 June 1989","isNumber":"5125","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1992","citationCount":"3","articleId":"198558","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":198827,"authors":[{"name":"I.R.

A new complex polyphase-FFT TMUX algorithm using two N/2-point complex conjugate fast transform processors with direct application to the SCPC-FDMA QPSK MCD has been presented which, for an N=16 channel MCD functioning at a sampling rate of 9.6 kHz allows a saving of 60% in the number of non-trivial real multiplications required in the transform processors, and gives a reduction of approximately 2% and 4% in the number of real additions and multiplications respectively in the TMUX processing as a whole. The new approach may offer greater flexibility than current block-transform approaches for a VLSI implementation.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEE Colloquium on Modems and Codecs for Satellite Communications","pdfPath":"/iel3/1971/5146/00198827.pdf","startPage":"12/1","endPage":"12/5","publicationTitle":"IEE Colloquium on Modems and Codecs for Satellite Communications","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5146","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=198827","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"New fast transform based complex transmultiplexer algorithm for QPSK digital multicarrier demodulator application","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Discrete Fourier transforms","Frequency division multiplexing","Phase shift keying"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fast Fourier transforms","frequency division multiplexing","phase shift keying"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FFT","complex transmultiplexer algorithm","QPSK digital multicarrier demodulator","fast transform processors","SCPC-FDMA QPSK MCD","sampling rate","VLSI"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IET","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/198827/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-23 Oct. 1989","displayDocTitle":"New fast transform based complex transmultiplexer algorithm for QPSK digital multicarrier demodulator application","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1989","accessionNumber":"3578682","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"23-23 Oct. 1989","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"New fast transform based complex transmultiplexer algorithm for QPSK digital multicarrier demodulator application","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"00198827.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.021132S","chronDate":"23-23 Oct. 1989","isNumber":"5146","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1971","citationCount":"1","articleId":"198827","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":199031,"authors":[{"name":"B.

Gain narrowing and self-phase-modulation (SPM) are the main mechanisms that modulate the final compressed pulse temporally and spectrally. The effect of gain saturation is also investigated. Due to the large chirp of this type of laser pulse, the power gain of the amplifier can be treated as a function of instantaneous frequency to simplify the analysis. Experimental results from an Nd:glass CPA laser system are in good agreement with the theory.

The method is simple, general, broadband, and does not require a reference pulse. Using virtually any instantaneous nonlinear-optical effect, FROG involves measuring the spectrum of the signal pulse as a function of the delay between two input pulses. The resulting trace of intensity versus frequency and delay is related to the pulse's spectrogram a visually intuitive transform containing time and frequency information. It is proven using phase retrieval concepts that the FROG trace yields the full intensity I(t) and phase phi (t) of an arbitrary ultrashort pulse with no physically significant ambiguities. FROG appears to have temporal resolution limited only by the response of the nonlinear medium. The method is demonstrated by using self-diffraction through the electronic Kerr effect in BK-7 glass and 620-nm, linearly chirped, approximately 200-fs pulses of a few microjoules.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/199311/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1993","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1993","volume":"29","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 1993","accessionNumber":"4424391","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","displayDocTitle":"Characterization of arbitrary femtosecond pulses using frequency-resolved optical gating","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Characterization of arbitrary femtosecond pulses using frequency-resolved optical gating","sourcePdf":"00199311.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.04846S","chronDate":"Feb 1993","isNumber":"5181","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3","citationCount":"545","articleId":"199311","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-13"},{"_id":199315,"authors":[{"name":"P.R.

This compact analog implementation is shown to exhibit image processing features commonly associated with biological vision systems, including adaptation to mean luminance levels and enhanced contrast around spatial edges.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/3.199319","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5181","startPage":"645","endPage":"654","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel1/3/5181/00199319.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Implementation of multiplicative lateral inhibition in a GaAs sensory neural-network photodetector array","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/199319/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1993","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1993","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Implementation of multiplicative lateral inhibition in a GaAs sensory neural-network photodetector array","publicationDate":"Feb. 1993","accessionNumber":"4424398","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"29","issue":"2","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Implementation of multiplicative lateral inhibition in a GaAs sensory neural-network photodetector array","sourcePdf":"00199319.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.079668S","chronDate":"Feb 1993","isNumber":"5181","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3","citationCount":"4","articleId":"199319","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":199320,"authors":[{"name":"A.L.

Transistors and circuits were fabricated using four different vertical profiles, three with a graded-bandgap SiGe base, and one with a Si base for comparison. All four epitaxial-base profiles yield transistors with DC properties suitable for high-speed logic applications in the 77-K environment. The differences between the low-temperature DC characteristics of Si and SiGe transistors are highlighted both theoretically and experimentally. A performance tradeoff associated with the use of an intrinsic spacer layer to reduce parasitic leakage at low temperatures and the consequent base resistance degradation due to enhanced carrier freeze-out is identified. Evidence that a collector-base heterojunction barrier effect severely degrades the current drive and transconductance of SiGe-base transistors operating at low temperatures is provided.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel1/16/5182/00199358.pdf","startPage":"525","endPage":"541","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","doi":"10.1109/16.199358","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/16.199358","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5182","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=199358","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the profile design and optimization of epitaxial Si- and SiGe-base bipolar technology for 77 K applications.

To facilitate logic design employing this transistor, a graphical technique called the floating-gate potential diagram has been developed. It is shown that any Boolean functions can be generated using a common circuit configuration of two-stage nu MOS inverters. One of the most striking features of nu MOS binary-logic application is the realization of a so-called soft hardware logic circuit. The circuit can be made to represent any logic function (AND, OR, NAND, NOR, exclusive-NOR, exclusive-OR, etc.) by adjusting external control signals without any modifications in its hardware configuration. The circuit allows real-time reconfigurable systems to be built. Test circuits were fabricated by a double-polysilicon CMOS process and their operation was experimentally verified.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neurons","MOSFETs","Hardware","Circuit testing","Biological system modeling","Circuit simulation","Logic design","Boolean functions","Inverters","Logic circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS integrated circuits","integrated logic circuits","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["soft-hardware-logic circuit implementation","design principles","binary-logic circuits","functional device","neuron MOS transistor","single MOS transistor","graphical technique","floating-gate potential diagram","Boolean functions","common circuit configuration","two-stage nu MOS inverters","any logic function","external control signals","real-time reconfigurable systems","double-polysilicon CMOS process","operation"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=199362","doi":"10.1109/16.199362","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel1/16/5182/00199362.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/16.199362","startPage":"570","endPage":"576","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5182","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neuron MOS binary-logic integrated circuits.

It is found that due to very low drift region resistance, 5000-V SiC Schottky rectifiers and power MOSFETs can deliver on-state current density of 100 A/cm/sup 2/ at room temperature with a forward drop of only 3.85 and 2.95 V, respectively.

A thermal analysis shows that 5000-V, 6H-, and 3C-SiC MOSFETs and Schottky rectifiers would be approximately 20 and 18 times smaller than corresponding Si devices, and that operation at higher temperatures and at higher breakdown voltages than conventional Si devices is possible.

The computerised torsional measurement system described has been designed to measure translational and torsional motion simultaneously at points along a rotating shaft. It overcomes the drawbacks of existing systems that measure torsional vibrations, which are either expensive, require shaft modifications, or do not account for the coupling between torsional and translational motions.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/19.199411","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","pdfPath":"/iel1/19/5183/00199411.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5183","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/19.199411","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","startPage":"803","endPage":"807","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A torsional vibration measurement system","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=199411","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1992","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1992","displayDocTitle":"A torsional vibration measurement system","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/199411/","volume":"41","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 1992","accessionNumber":"4389197","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A torsional vibration measurement system","sourcePdf":"00199411.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.070777S","chronDate":"Dec 1992","isNumber":"5183","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"19","citationCount":"19","articleId":"199411","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":199421,"authors":[{"name":"O.B.

The goal of this study was to develop an instrument having measurement uncertainty of less than +or-50 p.p.m. over these frequencies. The wattmeter was built around a wideband instrument developed earlier, and it uses 16-b analog-to-digital (A/D) converters and includes a two-stage current transformer in one of the input modules. It operates with asynchronous sampling, and high accuracy is achieved by approximately synchronizing the interval over which sampls are taken with the period of the input signal. Special care was taken to design input stages with a flat frequency response and low temperature sensitivity. The wattmeter has been calibrated using an audio-frequency power bridge. The two instruments agreed to better than +or-50 p.p.m. of full scale over the 50 Hz to 1000 Hz frequency range at all power factors.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sampling methods","Wattmeters","Instruments","Power measurement","Measurement uncertainty","Wideband","Analog-digital conversion","Current transformers","Frequency synchronization","Frequency response"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analogue-digital conversion","power measurement","signal processing equipment","wattmeters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["NIST","sampling wattmeter","waveform sampling","power measurements","two-stage current transformer","asynchronous sampling","flat frequency response","temperature sensitivity","audio-frequency power bridge","50 to 1000 Hz"]}],"doi":"10.1109/19.199445","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","pdfPath":"/iel1/19/5183/00199445.pdf","startPage":"974","endPage":"978","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5183","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/19.199445","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High-accuracy sampling wattmeter","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=199445","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"High-accuracy sampling wattmeter","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/199445/","volume":"41","issue":"6","publicationDate":"Dec. 1992","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4392549","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1992","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1992","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High-accuracy sampling wattmeter","sourcePdf":"00199445.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039629S","chronDate":"Dec 1992","isNumber":"5183","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"19","citationCount":"26","articleId":"199445","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":199446,"authors":[{"name":"F.N.

In particular, the stochastic search for an associative mapping that maximizes the expected pay-off arising from reinforcement is formulated as a random IFS on weight-space. The dynamical evolution of the weights is described by a Markov process. If this process is ergodic then the limiting behavior of the system is described by an invariant probability measure on weight space that can have a fractal-like structure. A class of associative reinforcement learning algorithms is constructed that is an extension of the nonassociative schemes used in stochastic automata theory. The issue of generalization is discussed within the IFS framework and related to the stochastic and possibly fractal nature of the learning process.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/21.199461","startPage":"1348","endPage":"1360","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/21.199461","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5184","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel1/21/5184/00199461.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of associative reinforcement learning in neural networks using iterated function systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/199461/","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of associative reinforcement learning in neural networks using iterated function systems","volume":"22","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4392609","publicationDate":"Nov.-Dec. 1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov/Dec 1992","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov/Dec 1992","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of associative reinforcement learning in neural networks using iterated function systems","sourcePdf":"00199461.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.049446S","chronDate":"Nov/Dec 1992","isNumber":"5184","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"21","citationCount":"8","articleId":"199461","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":199466,"authors":[{"name":"L.-X.

SAFEbus consists of two self-checking buses. The overriding goal in the design of SAFEbus has been to prevent unintended and undetected interactions among the integrated avionics functions and to control complexity so that airplane certification is straightforward.

The output is calculated by a nonlinear feedback loop. In the feedforward path the quantizer characteristic can be taken as continuous. It exhibits a threshold and has a linear part with a variable slope p greater than 1. In the feedback path the linear filter R is recursive. Stability of R is sufficient but not necessary to ensure stability of the DPCM system. Conditions for stability of an order 1 predictor are determined. Comparison with the classical concept of stability for linear systems displays three specific features of the DPCM case: 1) the conditions on the prediction coefficient are less stringent: 2) the kind of stability is weaker; and 3) the negative case has a better stability than the positive case. As a function of the quantizer slope, the maximum prediction coefficient exhibits a maximum. The corresponding value p/sub opt/ delimits two ranges. For smaller slopes the quantizer threshold effect degrades the stability. At the optimum, the range of stability is the same with and without the quantizer threshold.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Stability","Quantization","Linear systems","Decoding","Feedback loop","Nonlinear filters","Displays","Degradation","Adaptive systems","Phase change materials"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analogue-digital conversion","feedback","pulse code modulation links","stability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["BIBO stability","DPCM transmission system","differential pulse code modulation","nonlinear feedback loop","feedforward path","quantizer characteristic","prediction coefficient"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=199897","doi":"10.1109/82.199897","startPage":"705","endPage":"722","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Analog and Digital Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Analog and Digital Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/82/5197/00199897.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5197","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/82.199897","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/199897/","displayDocTitle":"Stability of the DPCM transmission system","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1992","volume":"39","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4394115","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Stability of the DPCM transmission system","sourcePdf":"00199897.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.032787S","chronDate":"Oct 1992","isNumber":"5197","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"82","citationCount":"5","articleId":"199897","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":199898,"authors":[{"name":"J.-I.

Since the multipliers consume much hardware area, the designs utilize small ROMs and adders to implement the multiplications.

The CBP algorithm filters each projection as it is recorded and then backprojects the ensemble of filtered projections to create the final image in a pixel-by-pixel format. CBP reconstruction produces high-quality images by handling the recorded data directly in polar format. The CBP algorithm requires only 1-D interpolation along the filtered projections to determine the precise values that must be contributed to the backprojection summation from each projection. The algorithm is thus able to produce higher quality images by eliminating the inaccuracies of 2-D interpolation, as well as using all the data recorded in the spectral domain annular sector more effectively. The computational complexity of the CBP algorithm is O(N/sup 3/).<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/83.199920","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/83/5198/00199920.pdf","startPage":"505","endPage":"517","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/83.199920","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5198","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Convolution backprojection image reconstruction for spotlight mode synthetic aperture radar","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=199920","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct.  1992","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/199920/","displayDocTitle":"Convolution backprojection image reconstruction for spotlight mode synthetic aperture radar","volume":"1","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Oct. 1992","accessionNumber":"4323006","pubMedId":"18296183","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Convolution backprojection image reconstruction for spotlight mode synthetic aperture radar","sourcePdf":"00199920.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.046109S","chronDate":"Oct.  1992","isNumber":"5198","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"203","articleId":"199920","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":199923,"authors":[{"name":"T.

As an alternative to architecture-specific policies, intrinsic characteristics of the neural paradigm with respect to a functional error model are considered. In particular, this has been done for multilayered back-propagation networks, where both the classification errors induced by insurgence of a fault and the possibility of masking such errors through a repeated learning phase have been studied. Such abstract results can be used to analyze various silicon architectures implementing the multi-layered nets; physical faults are mapped onto the functional error classes, so as the evaluate both the intrinsic robustness of the various architectures and their critical areas, where ad-hoc design modifications or redundancies must be inserted to increase fault-tolerance properties. In the present paper some relevant implementations, representative of various design philosophies, are considered from this point of view.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 Nov 1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/199950/","accessionNumber":"4203852","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1991","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"18-20 Nov. 1991","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Neural networks on silicon: the mapping of hardware faults onto behavioral errors","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural networks on silicon: the mapping of hardware faults onto behavioral errors","confLoc":"Hidden Valley, PA, USA","sourcePdf":"00199950.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061914S","chronDate":"18-20 Nov 1991","isNumber":"5199","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"381","citationCount":"2","articleId":"199950","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":199958,"authors":[{"name":"Hong Hao","affiliation":["Center for Reliable Computing, University of Stanford, Stanford, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Hong Hao","id":"37087288677"},{"name":"E.J.

These models reflect the resistive nature of gate oxide shorts and the difference between n- and p-channel transistors. The resistance of a short plays a central role in determining the actual circuit behavior. Faults caused by gate oxide shorts can be dependent not only on inputs to the gate containing the fault but also on other signals in the circuit, and can escape tests generated using normal TPG schemes. The stuck-at test set for a logic gate cannot guarantee to detect all transistor gate-to-source and gate-to-drain shorts in the logic gate. Gate oxide shorts in n-channel transistors affect circuit operation more severely than those in p-channel transistors do.

In most cases the associated reconfiguration problems are NP-complete. Therefore, exhaustive search algorithms are generally used in order to find a solution when one exists. In this paper we present the notion of admissible sets and show how such sets can be used to significantly reduce the running time of many exhaustive search algorithms for reconfiguration problems. As an example, the authors find a class of admissible sets called excess-k critical sets that can be used in the design of fast search algorithms for the problem of reconfiguring redundant random access memories (RRAMs). They also consider applications to the problems of reconfiguring RRAMs with shared spares and reconfiguring redundant programmable logic arrays (RPLAs). Experimental results indicate that this approach is very powerful.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/DFTVS.1991.199969","publicationTitle":"[Proceedings] 1991 International Workshop on Defect and Fault Tolerance on VLSI Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"[Proceedings] 1991 International Workshop on Defect and Fault Tolerance on VLSI Systems","pdfPath":"/iel2/381/5199/00199969.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DFTVS.1991.199969","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5199","startPage":"260","endPage":"273","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fast search algorithms for reconfiguration problems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=199969","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Fast search algorithms for reconfiguration problems","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 Nov 1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/199969/","conferenceDate":"18-20 Nov. 1991","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1991","accessionNumber":"4199255","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast search algorithms for reconfiguration problems","confLoc":"Hidden Valley, PA, USA","sourcePdf":"00199969.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.03785S","chronDate":"18-20 Nov 1991","isNumber":"5199","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"381","citationCount":"14","articleId":"199969","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":199970,"authors":[{"name":"K.
