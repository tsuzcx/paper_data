By using an approximate model for the grid voltage magnitudes, we show that these signals exhibit some specific correlation properties, that can be described via a sparse Markov random field. By specializing the tools available for the identification of graphical models, we propose an algorithm for the reconstruction of the grid topology. Via simulations, we show how the algorithm performs well also when an exact nonlinear model of the grid voltages is adopted, when realistic power demand profiles are considered, and when the voltage measurements are affected by measurement noise.","displayPublicationTitle":"52nd IEEE Conference on Decision and Control","pdfPath":"/iel7/6749719/6759837/06760120.pdf","startPage":"1659","endPage":"1664","publicationTitle":"52nd IEEE Conference on Decision and Control","doi":"10.1109/CDC.2013.6760120","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CDC.2013.6760120","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6759837","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6760120","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Identification of power distribution network topology via voltage correlation analysis","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Topology","Voltage measurement","Power distribution","Correlation","Network topology","Power demand"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distribution networks","Markov processes","voltage measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power distribution network topology","voltage correlation analysis","voltage measurements","approximate model","grid voltage magnitudes","sparse Markov random field","grid topology","power demand profiles","measurement noise"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6760120/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 Dec. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Identification of power distribution network topology via voltage correlation analysis","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6760120/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","accessionNumber":"14158240","dateOfInsertion":"10 March 2014","conferenceDate":"10-13 Dec. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Identification of power distribution network topology via voltage correlation analysis","confLoc":"Firenze, Italy","sourcePdf":"1988.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064063S","chronDate":"10-13 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6749719","isNumber":"6759837","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6749719","citationCount":"102","xplore-issue":"6759837","articleId":"6760120","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":6760170,"authors":[{"name":"Edward N.

An ordered pair of nodes is connected by a directed link within a time region if any combination of their velocity and time values is within the acceptable range of the nodes and produces a trajectory satisfying a set of safety constraints. In this manner, a possible trajectory, with transit time, connecting an arbitrary starting node and destination node is obtained by applying a graph search technique on the proposed roadmap.

Incorporating higher-order dynamics in terms of local auxiliary variables, we prove a result of guaranteed convergence to the solution set for sufficiently small values of the step size.","doi":"10.1109/CDC.2013.6760329","publicationTitle":"52nd IEEE Conference on Decision and Control","displayPublicationTitle":"52nd IEEE Conference on Decision and Control","pdfPath":"/iel7/6749719/6759837/06760329.pdf","startPage":"2933","endPage":"2938","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CDC.2013.6760329","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6759837","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Stability and convergence of distributed algorithms for the OPF problem","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6760329","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 Dec. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6760329/","displayDocTitle":"Stability and convergence of distributed algorithms for the OPF problem","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","accessionNumber":"14158034","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6760329/","conferenceDate":"10-13 Dec. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"10 March 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Stability and convergence of distributed algorithms for the OPF problem","confLoc":"Firenze, Italy","sourcePdf":"1860.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053627S","chronDate":"10-13 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6749719","isNumber":"6759837","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6749719","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"6759837","articleId":"6760329","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6760331,"authors":[{"name":"Andreas Ulbig","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering ETH Zurich, Power Systems Laboratory, Zurich, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Andreas","lastName":"Ulbig","id":"37546100100"},{"name":"Tobias Rinke","affiliation":["ETH Zurich Power Systems Laboratory"],"firstName":"Tobias","lastName":"Rinke","id":"37086791011"},{"name":"Spyros Chatzivasileiadis","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering ETH Zurich, Power Systems Laboratory, Zurich, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Spyros","lastName":"Chatzivasileiadis","id":"37547532000"},{"name":"G\u00f6ran Andersson","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering ETH Zurich, Power Systems Laboratory, Zurich, Switzerland"],"firstName":"G\u00f6ran","lastName":"Andersson","id":"37272976300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5717-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5714-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-1381-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0191-2216"}],"articleNumber":"6760331","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":28,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":681},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Generators","Trajectory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frequency control","power system control","predictive control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["real-time frequency regulation","rotational inertia provision","real-time optimal control schemes","grid frequency regulation","renewable energy sources","RES","model predictive control","MPC","power system unit operational constraints","ramp-rate","power rating","energy constraints"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents real-time optimal control schemes for regulating grid frequency and providing rotational inertia in power systems, two control problems with fast dynamics on the time-scale of milliseconds.

The presented control schemes are based on explicit model predictive control (MPC), which allows to directly incorporate operational constraints of power system units, i.e. ramp-rate, power rating and energy constraints, and to achieve real-time tractability while keeping the online computation effort low.

Particular attention is devoted to goals that become feasible only if a subset of the safety rules are violated. The proposed algorithm computes a control law, that minimizes the level of unsafety while the desired goal is guaranteed to be reached. This problem is motivated by an autonomous car navigating an urban environment while following rules of the road such as \u201calways travel in right lane\u201d and \u201cdo not change lanes frequently\u201d. Ideas behind sampling based motion-planning algorithms, such as Probabilistic Road Maps (PRMs) and Rapidly-exploring Random Trees (RRTs), are employed to incrementally construct a finite concretization of the dynamics as a durational Kripke structure. In conjunction with this, a weighted finite automaton that captures the safety rules is used in order to find an optimal trajectory that minimizes the violation of safety rules. We prove that the proposed algorithm guarantees asymptotic optimality, i.e., almost-sure convergence to optimal solutions. We present results of simulation experiments and an implementation on an autonomous urban mobility-on-demand system.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6760374/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 Dec. 2013","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"10-13 Dec. 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6760374/","dateOfInsertion":"10 March 2014","publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","accessionNumber":"14157824","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Incremental sampling-based algorithm for minimum-violation motion planning","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Incremental sampling-based algorithm for minimum-violation motion planning","confLoc":"Firenze, Italy","sourcePdf":"1978.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068488S","chronDate":"10-13 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6749719","isNumber":"6759837","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6749719","citationCount":"33","xplore-issue":"6759837","articleId":"6760374","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6760383,"authors":[{"name":"Antonia Maria Masucci","affiliation":["ETIS/ENSEA - Universit\u00e9 de Cergy Pontoise-CNRS"],"firstName":"Antonia Maria","lastName":"Masucci","id":"37680671800"},{"name":"Alonso Silva","affiliation":["Alcatel-Lucent Bell Labs, France"],"firstName":"Alonso","lastName":"Silva","id":"37401627100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5717-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5714-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-1381-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0191-2216"}],"articleNumber":"6760383","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":54},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Polynomials","Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","Network topology","Computational modeling","Symmetric matrices","Laplace equations","Nickel"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["directed graphs","multiprocessor interconnection networks","network theory (graphs)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["information spreading","epidemic modeling","computer networks","telecommunication networks","susceptible-infected-susceptible spreading model","torus length","torus network topology","characteristic polynomial","explicit expressions","lower bounds","spectral radius"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6760383","doi":"10.1109/CDC.2013.6760383","publicationTitle":"52nd IEEE Conference on Decision and Control","abstract":"Epidemic modeling has been extensively used in the last years in the field of telecommunications and computer networks.

We study the interactions between the HPU and the LPU using a game theoretical approach to search for the optimal time allocation for individual transmissions and cooperation among users. We propose a new Stackelberg game formulation, in which the reputation of both users is considered to encourage cooperation and prevent misbehavior.

When agents cooperate or compete in the community, a collective behavior, such as consensus, polarization or diversity, may emerge. In this paper, we investigate a bipartite consensus process, in which all the agents converge to a final state characterized by identical modulus but opposite sign. Firstly, the interaction network of the agents is represented by a directed signed graph. A neighbor-based interaction rule is proposed for each agent with a single integrator dynamics. Then, we classify the signed network into heterogeneous networks and homogeneous networks according to the sign of edges. Under a weak connectivity assumption that the signed network has a spanning tree, some sufficient conditions are derived for bipartite consensus of multi-agent systems with the help of a structural balance theory. At the same time, signless Laplacian matrix and signed Laplacian matrix are introduced to analyze the bipartite consensus of multi-agent systems on homogeneous networks and heterogenous networks, respectively. Finally, simulation results are provided to demonstrate the bipartite consensus formation.","doi":"10.1109/CDC.2013.6760412","pdfPath":"/iel7/6749719/6759837/06760412.pdf","startPage":"3451","endPage":"3456","displayPublicationTitle":"52nd IEEE Conference on Decision and Control","publicationTitle":"52nd IEEE Conference on Decision and Control","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CDC.2013.6760412","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6759837","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bipartite consensus for multi-agent systems on directed signed networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6760412/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 Dec. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Bipartite consensus for multi-agent systems on directed signed networks","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"10 March 2014","accessionNumber":"14158068","publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6760412/","conferenceDate":"10-13 Dec. 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bipartite consensus for multi-agent systems on directed signed networks","confLoc":"Firenze, Italy","sourcePdf":"0565.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.087941S","chronDate":"10-13 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6749719","isNumber":"6759837","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6749719","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6759837","articleId":"6760412","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":6760448,"authors":[{"name":"Franck Iutzeler","affiliation":["Telecom ParisTech, CNRS LTCI, Paris, France"],"firstName":"Franck","lastName":"Iutzeler","id":"38233800600"},{"name":"Pascal Bianchi","affiliation":["Telecom ParisTech, CNRS LTCI, Paris, France"],"firstName":"Pascal","lastName":"Bianchi","id":"37284532300"},{"name":"Philippe Ciblat","affiliation":["Telecom ParisTech, CNRS LTCI, Paris, France"],"firstName":"Philippe","lastName":"Ciblat","id":"37284917800"},{"name":"Walid Hachem","affiliation":["Telecom ParisTech, CNRS LTCI, Paris, France"],"firstName":"Walid","lastName":"Hachem","id":"37272067300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5717-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5714-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-1381-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0191-2216"}],"articleNumber":"6760448","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":96,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":694},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optimization","Standards","Equations","Convergence","Convex functions","Random variables","Vectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed algorithms","iterative methods","network theory (graphs)","optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["asynchronous distributed optimization method","randomized alternating direction method-of-multipliers","ADMM","networked agents","private cost functions","aggregate cost minimization","network components","randomized Gauss-Seidel iterations","randomized Douglas-Rachford splitting","asynchronous algorithm","mild connectivity conditions"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6760448","abstract":"Consider a set of networked agents endowed with private cost functions and seeking to find a consensus on the minimizer of the aggregate cost.

While most QLC methods are applicable to systems with symmetric nonlinearities, the current paper provides a technique for asymmetric ones, specifically, asymmetric saturating actuators. As in the symmetric case, the approach is based on the method of stochastic linearization, which reduces nonlinear systems to quasilinear ones. In the symmetric case, each nonlinear element is replaced by a gain. In the asymmetric case, however, each nonlinear element is replaced not only by a gain, but also by a bias. The latter leads to steady state errors incompatible with the usual error coefficients. Therefore, the performance of these quasilinear systems must be characterized not only by a root locus, but by another locus as well - the tracking error locus. In this paper these performance loci are characterized, methods for their calculation and sketching are presented, and the results are utilized for tracking controllers design.","doi":"10.1109/CDC.2013.6760468","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CDC.2013.6760468","publicationTitle":"52nd IEEE Conference on Decision and Control","displayPublicationTitle":"52nd IEEE Conference on Decision and Control","pdfPath":"/iel7/6749719/6759837/06760468.pdf","startPage":"3794","endPage":"3799","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6759837","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6760468/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 Dec. 2013","displayDocTitle":"QLC-based design of reference tracking controllers for systems with asymmetric saturating actuators","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"10-13 Dec. 2013","accessionNumber":"14157867","htmlLink":"/document/6760468/","dateOfInsertion":"10 March 2014","publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"QLC-based design of reference tracking controllers for systems with asymmetric saturating actuators","confLoc":"Firenze, Italy","sourcePdf":"1565.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076239S","chronDate":"10-13 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6749719","isNumber":"6759837","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6749719","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6759837","articleId":"6760468","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6760476,"authors":[{"name":"Bahare Kiumarsi-Khomartash","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Ferdowsi University of Mashhad, Iran"],"firstName":"Bahare","lastName":"Kiumarsi-Khomartash","id":"37086710137"},{"name":"Frank L.

Then, using the quadratic form of the value function, an augmented algebraic Riccati equation (ARE) is derived to solve the LQT. Using this formulation, both feedback and feedforward parts of the optimal control solution are obtained simultaneously by solving the augmented ARE. To find the solution to the augmented ARE online, policy iteration as a class of reinforcement learning algorithms, is employed. This algorithm is implemented on an actor-critic structure by using two neural networks and it does not need the knowledge of the drift system dynamics or the command generator dynamics. A simulation example shows that the proposed algorithm works for a system with partially unknown dynamics.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CDC.2013.6760476","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6759837","startPage":"3845","endPage":"3850","displayPublicationTitle":"52nd IEEE Conference on Decision and Control","pdfPath":"/iel7/6749719/6759837/06760476.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal tracking control for linear discrete-time systems using reinforcement learning","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6760476/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 Dec. 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6760476/","displayDocTitle":"Optimal tracking control for linear discrete-time systems using reinforcement learning","conferenceDate":"10-13 Dec. 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","accessionNumber":"14157835","dateOfInsertion":"10 March 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal tracking control for linear discrete-time systems using reinforcement learning","confLoc":"Firenze, Italy","sourcePdf":"0040.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065504S","chronDate":"10-13 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6749719","isNumber":"6759837","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6749719","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"6759837","articleId":"6760476","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6760488,"authors":[{"name":"Aditya Zutshi","affiliation":["faculty of Computer Science, University of Colorado, Boulder, CO"],"firstName":"Aditya","lastName":"Zutshi","id":"37085704294"},{"name":"Sriram Sankaranarayanan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Computer and Energy Engineering (ECEE) Department, University of Colorado, Boulder, CO"],"firstName":"Sriram","lastName":"Sankaranarayanan","id":"37409120700"},{"name":"Jyotirmoy V.

Many formal verification techniques for hybrid systems, including flowpipe construction, can identify plausible abstract counterexamples for property violations. However, there is often a gap between the reported abstract counterexamples and the concrete system trajectories. Our approach starts with a candidate sequence of disconnected trajectory segments, each segment lying inside a discrete mode. However, such disconnected segments do not form concrete violations due to the gaps that exist between the ending state of one segment and the starting state of the subsequent segment. Therefore, trajectory splicing uses local optimization to minimize the gap between these segments, effectively splicing them together to form a concrete trajectory. We demonstrate the use of our approach for falsifying safety properties of hybrid systems using standard optimization techniques. As such, our approach is not restricted to linear systems. We compare our approach with other falsification approaches including uniform random sampling and a robustness guided falsification approach used in the tool S-Taliro. Our preliminary evaluation clearly shows the potential of our approach to search for candidate trajectory segments and use them to find concrete property violations.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6759837","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CDC.2013.6760488","publicationTitle":"52nd IEEE Conference on Decision and Control","displayPublicationTitle":"52nd IEEE Conference on Decision and Control","pdfPath":"/iel7/6749719/6759837/06760488.pdf","startPage":"3918","endPage":"3925","doi":"10.1109/CDC.2013.6760488","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A trajectory splicing approach to concretizing counterexamples for hybrid systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 Dec. 2013","displayDocTitle":"A trajectory splicing approach to concretizing counterexamples for hybrid systems","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"10-13 Dec. 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6760488/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","accessionNumber":"14158740","dateOfInsertion":"10 March 2014","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6760488/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A trajectory splicing approach to concretizing counterexamples for hybrid systems","confLoc":"Firenze, Italy","sourcePdf":"2072.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071474S","chronDate":"10-13 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6749719","isNumber":"6759837","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6749719","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"6759837","articleId":"6760488","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6760519,"authors":[{"name":"Simone Formentin","affiliation":["Department of Engineering, University of Bergamo, Dalmine, Italy"],"firstName":"Simone","lastName":"Formentin","id":"37593380700"},{"name":"Dario Piga","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Eindhoven University of Technology, Eindhoven, The Netherlands"],"firstName":"Dario","lastName":"Piga","id":"37398458800"},{"name":"Roland T\u00f3th","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Eindhoven University of Technology, Eindhoven, The Netherlands"],"firstName":"Roland","lastName":"T\u00f3th","id":"37286416600"},{"name":"Sergio M.

When a measured data set is available, LPV model identification can provide low complexity linear models that can embed the underlying nonlinear dynamic behavior of the plant. For such models, powerful control synthesis tools are available, but the way the modeling error and the conservativeness of the embedding affect the control performance is still largely unknown. Therefore, it appears to be attractive to directly synthesize the controller from data without modeling the plant.

In order to manage the uplink interference caused by macrocell users at the femtocell base stations (FBS), cooperation between macrocell users with the closest femtocell base stations is proposed with the goal of aligning the received signals of macrocell users in the same subspace at multiple FBSs. The precoder design for macrocell users is accomplished using successive semidefinite programming relaxations. The proposed solution aims to minimize the cross-tier interference leaked to the femtocells while providing the macrocell users with a minimum received signal to interference plus noise ratio (SINR) at the macrocell base station (MBS).

We focus on the downlink, which is both more demanding in terms of traffic and more challenging in terms of implementation than the uplink. In order to enable multiuser joint precoding of the downlink signals, channel state information at the transmitter side is required. We consider Time Division Duplex (TDD), where the downlink channels can be learned from the user uplink pilot signals, thanks to channel reciprocity. Furthermore, coherent multiuser joint precoding is possible only if the APs maintain a sufficiently accurate relative timing and phase synchronization. AP synchronization and TDD reciprocity calibration are two key problems to be solved in order to enable distributed MU-MIMO downlink. In this paper, we propose novel over-the-air synchronization and calibration protocols that scale well with the network size. The proposed schemes can be applied to networks formed by a large number of APs, each of which is driven by an inexpensive 802.11-grade clock and has a standard RF front-end, not explicitly designed to be reciprocal. Our protocols can incorporate, as a building block, any suitable timing and frequency estimator. Here we revisit the problem of joint ML timing and frequency estimation and use the corresponding Cramer-Rao bound to evaluate the performance of the synchronization protocol. Overall, the proposed synchronization and calibration schemes are shown to achieve sufficient accuracy for satisfactory distributed MU-MIMO performance.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/6803026/06760595.pdf","startPage":"1815","endPage":"1831","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2014.030314.130474","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2014.030314.130474","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6803026","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6760595","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Scalable Synchronization and Reciprocity Calibration for Distributed Multiuser MIMO","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Synchronization","Calibration","MIMO","Protocols","Receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","frequency estimation","MIMO communication","precoding","synchronisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["scalable synchronization","reciprocity calibration","large scale distributed multiuser MIMO","MU-MIMO","wireless network architecture","access points","wired backhaul network","large distributed antenna system","multiuser joint precoding","downlink signals","channel state information","time division duplex","TDD","user uplink pilot signals","phase synchronization","relative timing","AP synchronization","TDD reciprocity calibration","novel over-the-air synchronization protocols","calibration protocols","standard RF front-end","frequency estimation","Cramer-Rao bound"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Distributed multiuser MIMO downlink","cooperative small cells","synchronization","TDD calibration"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6760595/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 March 2014","displayDocTitle":"Scalable Synchronization and Reciprocity Calibration for Distributed Multiuser MIMO","volume":"13","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/6760595/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2014","accessionNumber":"14252149","dateOfInsertion":"21 April 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Scalable Synchronization and Reciprocity Calibration for Distributed Multiuser MIMO","sourcePdf":"1815-tw1404-rogalin.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.139613S","chronDate":"April  2014","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6803026","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"137","xplore-issue":"6803026","articleId":"6760595","onlineDate":"07 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6760597,"authors":[{"name":"Chunxiao Jiang","affiliation":["University of Maryland"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/6803026/6760597/6760597-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Chunxiao Jiang (S'09-M'13) received his B.S. degree in information engineering from Beijing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics (Beihang University) in 2008 and the Ph.D. degree from Tsinghua University (THU), Beijing in 2013, both with the highest honors.

While there are some works in the social learning literature on how to construct belief on an uncertain network state, few study has been made on integrating learning with decision making for the scenario where users are uncertain about the network state and their decisions influence with each other. Moreover, the population in a social network can be dynamic since users may arrive at or leave the network at any time, which makes the problem even more challenging. In this paper, we propose a Dynamic Chinese Restaurant Game to study how a user in a dynamic social network learns the uncertain network state and make optimal decision by taking into account not only the immediate utility but also subsequent users' negative influence. We introduce a Bayesian learning based method for users to learn the network state, and propose a Multi-dimensional Markov Decision Process based approach for users to achieve the optimal decisions. Finally, we apply the Dynamic Chinese Restaurant Game to cognitive radio networks and demonstrate from simulations to verify the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed scheme.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6760597/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 March 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"13","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2014","dateOfInsertion":"21 April 2014","accessionNumber":"14252153","htmlLink":"/document/6760597/","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic Chinese Restaurant Game: Theory and Application to Cognitive Radio Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic Chinese Restaurant Game: Theory and Application to Cognitive Radio Networks","sourcePdf":"1960-tw1404-jiang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.080979S","chronDate":"April  2014","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6803026","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"45","xplore-issue":"6803026","articleId":"6760597","onlineDate":"07 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6760598,"authors":[{"name":"Wencen Wu","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Wencen","lastName":"Wu","id":"37085433185"},{"name":"Dongsik Chang","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Dongsik","lastName":"Chang","id":"37077698900"},{"name":"Fumin Zhang","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Fumin","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37406187900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5717-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5714-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-1381-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0191-2216"}],"articleNumber":"6760598","dbTime":"18 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":151},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Three-dimensional displays","Sensors","Equations","Mobile communication","Trajectory","Convergence","Vectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomimetics","distributed algorithms","mobile radio","stochastic processes","tracking","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["input-to-state stable system","smooth field","N-agent group","three-agent group","distributed source-seeking algorithm","complex lighting variation","fish schools","turbulent field","continuously-differential field","turbulent plume field","Poisson counting process","plume spikes","stochastic model","blue crab","3D field","three dimensional field","mobile sensor networks","bio-inspired robust 3D plume tracking strategy"]}],"abstract":"We develop a robust plume tracking strategy using mobile sensor networks in three dimensional (3D) fields. Inspired by the plume tracking behavior of blue crabs, we propose a stochastic model of plume spikes detected by sensing agents based on the Poisson counting process, which enables us to transform the turbulent plume field detected by sensing agents to a continuously-differential field, the minimum of which is considered as a source in the field, and shares the same location with the plume source. The transformation allows us to design and analyze source-seeking algorithms in smooth fields instead of in turbulent fields with higher fluctuation spatially and temporally. Inspired by fish schools that seek darker (shaded) regions in environments with complex lighting variations, we develop a distributed source-seeking algorithm using mobile sensor networks without explicit gradient estimation. The velocity of each agent is designed using only the measurements taken by the agent and the relative positions to its neighboring agents. We prove that, using this design, the moving direction of a three-agent group will converge to the opposite gradient direction of the field, thus, the group moves towards a source in the field. We also prove that the tracking system is input-to-state stable (ISS), indicating that the system is robust to disturbances. We then generalize the design to N-agent groups, and demonstrate the strategy in both smooth fields and turbulent fields in simulations.","doi":"10.1109/CDC.2013.6760598","publicationTitle":"52nd IEEE Conference on Decision and Control","displayPublicationTitle":"52nd IEEE Conference on Decision and Control","pdfPath":"/iel7/6749719/6759837/06760598.pdf","startPage":"4571","endPage":"4578","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CDC.2013.6760598","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6759837","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A bio-inspired robust 3D plume tracking strategy using mobile sensor networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6760598","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 Dec. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6760598/","displayDocTitle":"A bio-inspired robust 3D plume tracking strategy using mobile sensor networks","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","accessionNumber":"14179067","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6760598/","conferenceDate":"10-13 Dec. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"10 March 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A bio-inspired robust 3D plume tracking strategy using mobile sensor networks","confLoc":"Firenze, Italy","sourcePdf":"2219.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069247S","chronDate":"10-13 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6749719","isNumber":"6759837","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6749719","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6759837","articleId":"6760598","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6760599,"authors":[{"name":"Guangxu Zhu","affiliation":["Zhejiang University, The Institute of Information and Communication Engineering, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/6803026/6760599/6760599-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Guangxu Zhu received the B.S. degree in information and communication engineering from Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China, in 2012.

Assuming that the relay is subjected to co-channel interference (CCI) and additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) while the destination is corrupted by AWGN only, we propose three heuristic relay precoding schemes to combat the CCI, namely, 1) Maximum ratio combining/maximal ratio transmission (MRC/MRT), 2) Zero-forcing/MRT (ZF/MRT), 3) Minimum mean-square error/MRT (MMSE/MRT). We derive new exact outage expressions as well as simple high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) outage approximations for all three schemes. Our findings suggest that both the MRC/MRT and the MMSE/MRT schemes achieve a full diversity of N, while the ZF/MRT scheme achieves a diversity order of N-M, where N is the number of relay antennas and M is the number of interferers. In addition, we show that the MMSE/MRT scheme always achieves the best outage performance, and the ZF/MRT scheme outperforms the MRC/MRT scheme in the low SNR regime, while becomes inferior to the MRC/MRT scheme in the high SNR regime. Finally, in the large N regime, we show that both the ZF/MRT and MMSE/MRT schemes are capable of completely eliminating the CCI, while perfect interference cancelation is not possible with the MRC/MRT scheme.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2014.030514.131497","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/6803026/06760599.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2014.030514.131497","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6803026","startPage":"2308","endPage":"2321","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Outage Probability of Dual-Hop Multiple Antenna AF Systems with Linear Processing in the Presence of Co-Channel Interference","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6760599","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Outage Probability of Dual-Hop Multiple Antenna AF Systems with Linear Processing in the Presence of Co-Channel Interference","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6760599/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 March 2014","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"13","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 2014","accessionNumber":"14252154","dateOfInsertion":"21 April 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6760599/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Outage Probability of Dual-Hop Multiple Antenna AF Systems with Linear Processing in the Presence of Co-Channel Interference","sourcePdf":"2308-tw1404-zhu.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.170866S","chronDate":"April  2014","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6803026","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"48","xplore-issue":"6803026","articleId":"6760599","onlineDate":"07 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6760601,"authors":[{"name":"Taotao Wang","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/6803026/6760601/6760601-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Taotao Wang received his B.S.

In PNC, multiple users transmit to a relay simultaneously. PNC channel decoding is different from conventional multi-user channel decoding: specifically, the PNC relay aims to decode a network-coded message rather than the individual messages of the users. Although prior work has shown that PNC can significantly improve the throughput of a relay network, the improvement is predicated on the availability of accurate channel estimates. Channel estimation in PNC, however, can be particularly challenging because of 1) the overlapped signals of multiple users; 2) the correlations among data symbols induced by channel coding; and 3) time-varying channels. We combine the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm and belief propagation (BP) algorithm on a unified factor-graph framework to tackle these challenges. In this framework, channel estimation is performed by an EM subgraph, and channel decoding is performed by a BP subgraph that models a virtual encoder matched to the target of PNC channel decoding. Iterative message passing between these two subgraphs allow the optimal solutions for both to be approached progressively. We present extensive simulation results demonstrating the superiority of our PNC receivers over other PNC receivers.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/6803026/06760601.pdf","startPage":"2229","endPage":"2245","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2013.030514.131312","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2013.030514.131312","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6803026","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6760601","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint Channel Estimation and Channel Decoding in Physical-Layer Network Coding Systems: An EM-BP Factor Graph Framework","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","Decoding","Message passing","Relays","Iterative decoding","Receivers","Joints"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel coding","channel estimation","expectation-maximisation algorithm","graph theory","network coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["joint channel estimation","physical layer network coding systems","EM-BP factor graph framework","PNC systems","multiuser channel decoding","PNC channel decoding","network coded message","overlapped signals","data symbols","expectation maximization","EM algorithm","belief propagation","BP algorithm","unified factor graph framework","PNC receivers"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Physical-layer network coding","expectation-maximization","belief propagation","factor graph","message passing"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6760601/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 March 2014","displayDocTitle":"Joint Channel Estimation and Channel Decoding in Physical-Layer Network Coding Systems: An EM-BP Factor Graph Framework","volume":"13","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/6760601/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2014","accessionNumber":"14252150","dateOfInsertion":"21 April 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint Channel Estimation and Channel Decoding in Physical-Layer Network Coding Systems: An EM-BP Factor Graph Framework","sourcePdf":"2229-tw1404-wang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.107995S","chronDate":"April  2014","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6803026","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"6803026","articleId":"6760601","onlineDate":"07 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6760603,"authors":[{"name":"Xun Zhou","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/6803026/6760603/6760603-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Xun Zhou received her B.

For information transmission, we consider two types of multiple access schemes, namely, time division multiple access (TDMA) and orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA). At the receiver side, due to the practical limitation that circuits for harvesting energy from radio signals are not yet able to decode the carried information directly, each user applies either time switching (TS) or power splitting (PS) to coordinate the energy harvesting (EH) and information decoding (ID) processes. For the TDMA-based information transmission, we employ TS at the receivers; for the OFDMA-based information transmission, we employ PS at the receivers. Under the above two scenarios, we address the problem of maximizing the weighted sum-rate over all users by varying the time/frequency power allocation and either TS or PS ratio, subject to a minimum harvested energy constraint on each user as well as a peak and/or total transmission power constraint. For the TS scheme, by an appropriate variable transformation the problem is reformulated as a convex problem, for which the optimal power allocation and TS ratio are obtained by the Lagrange duality method. For the PS scheme, we propose an iterative algorithm to optimize the power allocation, subcarrier (SC) allocation and the PS ratio for each user. The performances of the two schemes are compared numerically as well as analytically for the special case of single-user setup. It is revealed that the peak power constraint imposed on each OFDM SC as well as the number of users in the system play key roles in the rate-energy performance comparison by the two proposed schemes.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2014.030514.131479","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/6803026/06760603.pdf","startPage":"2282","endPage":"2294","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6803026","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2014.030514.131479","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Wireless Information and Power Transfer in Multiuser OFDM Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6760603","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2014","displayDocTitle":"Wireless Information and Power Transfer in Multiuser OFDM Systems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6760603/","publicationDate":"April 2014","dateOfInsertion":"21 April 2014","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"14252156","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6760603/","volume":"13","issue":"4","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 March 2014","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wireless Information and Power Transfer in Multiuser OFDM Systems","sourcePdf":"2282-tw1404-zhou.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.110564S","chronDate":"April  2014","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6803026","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"212","xplore-issue":"6803026","articleId":"6760603","onlineDate":"07 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6760605,"authors":[{"name":"Hemin Yang","affiliation":["Mobile Health Lab, Peking University, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/6803026/6760605/6760605-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Hemin Yang received his B.S. degree from the School of Electronic Engineering and Computer Science at Peking University in July 2012.

Unfortunately, conventional approaches (e.g., scheduling, beamforming) cannot effectively deal with this kind of ICI because of configuration limitations in physical control channels. To solve this challenge, this study defines a new concept of `Interference Self-Coordination (ISC)' for enhancing this system-level information delivery. Specifically, we apply ISC to relieve the ICI effect over the Physical Downlink Control Channel (PDCCH), the most important physical control channel in Long-Term Evolution (LTE/LTE-Advanced) networks, in which Physical Cell Identifier (PCI) planning naturally serves as a self-coordination mechanism. We prove that PCI planning is the most effective solution to relieve ICI over PDCCHs, under the constraint of non-orthogonal control regions between neighboring cells. Since PCI planning is an NP-Complete problem, heuristic-strategy algorithms are devised for implementation, which are self-adaptive to dynamic configurations of the network and system, and compatible with any applicable ICI solutions. The numerical analysis and system-level simulation experiment results demonstrate that this proposal can increase overall system throughput by up to 17%, and also improve cell-edge throughput by up to 42%. In the worst 5% of sectors, the proposal can still obtain 45% system throughput and 200% cell-edge throughput gain.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2014.030514.130447","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/6803026/06760605.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2014.030514.130447","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6803026","startPage":"1874","endPage":"1887","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Interference Self-Coordination: A Proposal to Enhance Reliability of System-Level Information in OFDM-Based Mobile Networks via PCI Planning","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6760605","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Interference Self-Coordination: A Proposal to Enhance Reliability of System-Level Information in OFDM-Based Mobile Networks via PCI Planning","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6760605/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 March 2014","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"13","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 2014","accessionNumber":"14252144","dateOfInsertion":"21 April 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6760605/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Interference Self-Coordination: A Proposal to Enhance Reliability of System-Level Information in OFDM-Based Mobile Networks via PCI Planning","sourcePdf":"1874-tw1404-yang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.122177S","chronDate":"April  2014","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6803026","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"6803026","articleId":"6760605","onlineDate":"07 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6760609,"authors":[{"name":"Jae-Shin Han","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Yonsei University, Seoul, Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/6803026/6760609/6760609-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jae-Shin Han received the B.S. degree in electronics engineering from Konkuk University, Seoul, Korea, in 2011.

At this time, we consider each delayed FDR receives a signal from source, adjacent relays and its delayed loop interference signal from its transmit antenna. In the second, we propose an efficient iterative successive interference cancellation (SIC) technique at destination that gradually cancels a delayed signal in order to fully obtain link diversity generated from M-D-FDR. Then, we investigate the various properties of the proposed M-D-FDR network by analyzing the pairwise-error-probability (PEP) analysis, especially in terms of signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) between source to relays and source to destination links, respectively. Finally, we accomplish the performance evaluations to verify the analysis results and to compare with a non-delayed M-FDR (M-N-FDR) network.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Interference","Silicon carbide","Delays","Electrostatic discharges","Cooperative systems","Receiving antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplify and forward communication","iterative methods","radiofrequency interference","relay networks (telecommunication)","transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cooperative networks","amplify-and-forward multiple full duplex relays","cooperative system","AF","M-FDR","spatial diversity","adjacent relays","delayed loop interference signal","transmit antenna","iterative successive interference cancellation","SIC technique","delayed signal","pairwise error probability","PEP analysis","signal-to-noise ratios","SNR"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Amplify-and-forward","full-duplex relay","pair-wise error probability","successive interference cancellation"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TWC.2014.030314.131068","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/6803026/06760609.pdf","startPage":"2137","endPage":"2149","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6803026","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2014.030314.131068","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cooperative Networks with Amplify-and-Forward Multiple-Full-Duplex Relays","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6760609","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Cooperative Networks with Amplify-and-Forward Multiple-Full-Duplex Relays","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6760609/","volume":"13","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6760609/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"14252159","dateOfInsertion":"21 April 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 March 2014","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cooperative Networks with Amplify-and-Forward Multiple-Full-Duplex Relays","sourcePdf":"2137-tw1404-han.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.096058S","chronDate":"April  2014","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6803026","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"6803026","articleId":"6760609","onlineDate":"07 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6760613,"authors":[{"name":"Pavankumar Tallapragada","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Maryland, College Park, MD, USA"],"firstName":"Pavankumar","lastName":"Tallapragada","id":"38488668500"},{"name":"Nikhil Chopra","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Maryland, College Park, MD, USA"],"firstName":"Nikhil","lastName":"Chopra","id":"37283228300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5717-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5714-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-1381-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0191-2216"}],"articleNumber":"6760613","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":13,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":378},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Frequency control","Control systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["actuators","controllers","feedback","linear systems","sensors","time-varying systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["intra-layer communication","actuator layer","controller layer","sensor layer","SCAN","sensor-controller-actuator networks","linear time invariant systems","LTI systems","event-triggered dynamic output feedback control"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents the design of event-triggered output feedback controllers for LTI systems over Sensor- Controller-Actuator Networks (SCAN).

Further, the flow of information occurs from the sensor to controller to actuator layer with the intra-layer communication occurring only in the controller layer. The event-triggers are designed to utilize only locally available information, making the nodes' transmissions asynchronous. The proposed control design guarantees global asymptotic stability of the origin of the system and a positive lower bound for the inter-transmission times of each node individually.

To further speed the convergence, we use a simple preconditioning method, and we bound the difference between the resulting speed, and the fastest theoretically achievable using preconditioning. We include numerical experiments to illustrate the performance of the proposed method.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6760744/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 Dec. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"10 March 2014","accessionNumber":"14158481","htmlLink":"/document/6760744/","conferenceDate":"10-13 Dec. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Distributed weighted least squares estimation with fast convergence in large-scale systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed weighted least squares estimation with fast convergence in large-scale systems","confLoc":"Firenze, Italy","sourcePdf":"1876.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072602S","chronDate":"10-13 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6749719","isNumber":"6759837","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6749719","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6759837","articleId":"6760744","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6760795,"authors":[{"name":"Seung-Hi Lee","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering, Hanyang University, Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Seung-Hi","lastName":"Lee","id":"37281152900"},{"name":"Chung Choo Chung","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering, Hanyang University, Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Chung Choo","lastName":"Chung","id":"37290541900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5717-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5714-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-1381-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0191-2216"}],"articleNumber":"6760795","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":163},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Vectors","Approximation methods","Vehicles","Standards","Indexes","Aerospace electronics","Optimization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["approximation theory","predictive control","remotely operated vehicles","state feedback","state-space methods","steering systems","trees (mathematics)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["control gains","computing control","approximate explicit controls","state feedback gains","polytopes","multidimensional tree techniques","adaptive domain decomposition strategy","state space partitioning","multilevel approximation scheme","autonomous vehicle active steering","multilevel approximate model predictive control strategy"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6760795","abstract":"An innovative approximate explicit model predictive control strategy is proposed. A multilevel approximation scheme for state space partitioning is applied, which relies on an adaptive domain decomposition strategy using multidimensional tree techniques. Polytopes are generated from such state space partitioning, for which equivalent state feedback gains are computed such that approximate explicit controls can be simply computed. The proposed scheme requires no online optimization and thus computing control using pre-computed control gains is extremely fast. Through an application to autonomous vehicle lateral control, it is shown that the proposed method can achieve a significant improvement of computation time and approximation quality over other approximate predictive control methods.","doi":"10.1109/CDC.2013.6760795","pdfPath":"/iel7/6749719/6759837/06760795.pdf","startPage":"5746","endPage":"5751","displayPublicationTitle":"52nd IEEE Conference on Decision and Control","publicationTitle":"52nd IEEE Conference on Decision and Control","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CDC.2013.6760795","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6759837","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multilevel approximate model predictive control and its application to autonomous vehicle active steering","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6760795/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 Dec. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Multilevel approximate model predictive control and its application to autonomous vehicle active steering","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"10 March 2014","accessionNumber":"14157920","publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6760795/","conferenceDate":"10-13 Dec. 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multilevel approximate model predictive control and its application to autonomous vehicle active steering","confLoc":"Firenze, Italy","sourcePdf":"1267.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058392S","chronDate":"10-13 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6749719","isNumber":"6759837","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6749719","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6759837","articleId":"6760795","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":6760816,"authors":[{"name":"Matthew L.

We consider the estimation of such models from observations corrupted by additive Gaussian noise. We provide tight upper and lower bounds on the mean squared error (MSE) of a convex denoising program that uses a combination of regularizers to induce multiple structures. In the case of low rank and sparse matrices, we quantify the gap between the MSE of the convex program and the best achievable error, and we present a simple (nonconvex) thresholding algorithm that outperforms its convex counterpart and achieves almost optimal MSE. This paper extends prior work on a different but related problem: recovering simultaneously structured models from noiseless compressed measurements, where bounds on the number of required measurements were given. The present work shows a similar fundamental limitation exists in a statistical denoising setting.","doi":"10.1109/CDC.2013.6760840","publicationTitle":"52nd IEEE Conference on Decision and Control","displayPublicationTitle":"52nd IEEE Conference on Decision and Control","pdfPath":"/iel7/6749719/6759837/06760840.pdf","startPage":"6019","endPage":"6024","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CDC.2013.6760840","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6759837","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6760840","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Noisy estimation of simultaneously structured models: Limitations of convex relaxation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Noisy estimation of simultaneously structured models: Limitations of convex relaxation","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6760840/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 Dec. 2013","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6760840/","dateOfInsertion":"10 March 2014","publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","accessionNumber":"14157966","conferenceDate":"10-13 Dec. 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Noisy estimation of simultaneously structured models: Limitations of convex relaxation","confLoc":"Firenze, Italy","sourcePdf":"2038.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.09753S","chronDate":"10-13 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6749719","isNumber":"6759837","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6749719","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6759837","articleId":"6760840","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6760843,"authors":[{"name":"Lili Wang","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Industrial Control Technology, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, P.

We first describe a framework based on trajectory modeling, in which coarse statistical models are used to capture global motion patterns, and are employed in change detection to identify anomalous behavior at the object level. Our multi-target tracking framework combines geometric active contours with particle filtering to effectively deal with occlusions and clutter in the environment. In crowded scenes, however, such object level representation can become extremely unreliable: to deal with this we instead use of low-level motion features (e.g., optical flow) to capture group behavior. To keep the problem tractable, we utilize a subspace system identification method based on the Hankel matrix to extract relevant low order dynamics of these noisy features. The spectral properties of the Hankel matrix encode useful information about the dynamics, and can detect anomalous group behavior. In order to efficiently compute these spectral properties, we employ a randomized algorithm for singular value decomposition. Both approaches are demonstrated to robustly detect anomalous behavior in realistic indoor and outdoor videos.","doi":"10.1109/CDC.2013.6760916","publicationTitle":"52nd IEEE Conference on Decision and Control","displayPublicationTitle":"52nd IEEE Conference on Decision and Control","pdfPath":"/iel7/6749719/6759837/06760916.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CDC.2013.6760916","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6759837","startPage":"6489","endPage":"6495","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Anomaly detection in videos: A dynamical systems approach","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6760916","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Anomaly detection in videos: A dynamical systems approach","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 Dec. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6760916/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"10-13 Dec. 2013","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","accessionNumber":"14158745","dateOfInsertion":"10 March 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6760916/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Anomaly detection in videos: A dynamical systems approach","confLoc":"Firenze, Italy","sourcePdf":"1597.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.089759S","chronDate":"10-13 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6749719","isNumber":"6759837","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6749719","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6759837","articleId":"6760916","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6760963,"authors":[{"name":"Hongchuan Wei","affiliation":["Duke University, Durham, NC, US"],"firstName":"Hongchuan","lastName":"Wei","id":"37085351975"},{"name":"Weston Ross","affiliation":["Duke University, Durham, NC, US"],"firstName":"Weston","lastName":"Ross","id":"37085784524"},{"name":"Stefano Varisco","affiliation":["Ferrari S.p.A, Maranello, MO, Italia"],"firstName":"Stefano","lastName":"Varisco","id":"37086727664"},{"name":"Philippe Krief","affiliation":["Ferrari S.p.A, Maranello, MO, Italia"],"firstName":"Philippe","lastName":"Krief","id":"37086723588"},{"name":"Silvia Ferrari","affiliation":["Laboratory for Intelligent Systems and Controls (LISC), Duke University, Durham, NC, USA"],"firstName":"Silvia","lastName":"Ferrari","id":"37333128700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5717-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5714-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-1381-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0191-2216"}],"articleNumber":"6760963","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":274},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Vehicles","Wheels","Vehicle dynamics","Mathematical model","Torque","Target tracking","Neural networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neurocontrollers","predictive control","road traffic control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["human driver behavior modeling","receding horizon control","artificial neural network controllers","coupled lateral-longitudinal maneuvers","closed-course track","professional human driver","high-fidelity Ferrari GT driving simulator","model predictive control","vehicle control"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6760963","abstract":"This paper presents a comparison of receding horizon and artificial neural network controllers for the modeling of human driver behavior during coupled lateral-longitudinal maneuvers. Driver models have been previously developed using control theoretic approaches, such as model predictive control, also known as receding horizon control, and have been shown capable of providing satisfactory vehicle control. However, these models tend to outperform human drivers, for example, due to maneuvers that require high-frequency driver compensation, counter-steering behaviors as required to maintain stability, or modeling errors. Furthermore, tuning these driver models to different drivers, automobiles, and road conditions, can be very challenging, and requires expert human intervention. This paper presents an artificial neural network controller that overcomes these limitations, and, by adapting to the experimental data obtained from the human driver, is capable of reproducing the driver behavior more closely and under a broader range of operating conditions. The receding horizon and neural network controllers are tested and compared to the response of a professional human driver on a closed-course track using data obtained using a high-fidelity Ferrari GT driving simulator. The results show that the artificial neural network outperforms the receding horizon controller in mimicking the response of the professional human driver.","doi":"10.1109/CDC.2013.6760963","pdfPath":"/iel7/6749719/6759837/06760963.pdf","startPage":"6778","endPage":"6785","displayPublicationTitle":"52nd IEEE Conference on Decision and Control","publicationTitle":"52nd IEEE Conference on Decision and Control","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CDC.2013.6760963","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6759837","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modeling of human driver behavior via receding horizon and artificial neural network controllers","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6760963/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 Dec. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Modeling of human driver behavior via receding horizon and artificial neural network controllers","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"10 March 2014","accessionNumber":"14158488","publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6760963/","conferenceDate":"10-13 Dec. 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modeling of human driver behavior via receding horizon and artificial neural network controllers","confLoc":"Firenze, Italy","sourcePdf":"1422.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.104815S","chronDate":"10-13 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6749719","isNumber":"6759837","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6749719","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6759837","articleId":"6760963","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":6760964,"authors":[{"name":"R.

The DFIG is widely used as a wind generator; it allows the rotor speed to vary while synchronizing the stator directly to a fixed frequency power system. This generator has one back-to-back PWM voltage-source converter between the rotor and the electrical grid. The rotor side converter (RSC) is connected via a DC-link to the grid side converter (GSC), which is in turn connected to the stator terminals directly or through a step-up transformer. A high order neural network is used in order to obtain the DFIG mathematical model; then, based on this neural model, a block control schemes using discrete-time sliding modes (NNDTSM) is proposed for the RSC and the GSC. The performance of this scheme is evaluated by implementation in real-time using a 1/4HP DFIG prototype.","doi":"10.1109/CDC.2013.6760964","startPage":"6786","endPage":"6791","displayPublicationTitle":"52nd IEEE Conference on Decision and Control","pdfPath":"/iel7/6749719/6759837/06760964.pdf","publicationTitle":"52nd IEEE Conference on Decision and Control","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CDC.2013.6760964","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6759837","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Real-time sliding mode control with neural networks for a doubly fed induction generator","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Iron","Resistance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["asynchronous generators","neural nets","power engineering computing","power transformers","PWM power convertors","real-time systems","rotors","stators","variable structure systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["doubly fed induction generator","real-time sliding mode control","neural networks","block control","DFIG","infinity bus","wind generator","rotor speed","stator","fixed frequency power system","PWM voltage-source converter","electrical grid","rotor side converter","RSC","grid side converter","GSC","step-up transformer","discrete-time sliding modes"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6760964/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 Dec. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Real-time sliding mode control with neural networks for a doubly fed induction generator","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6760964/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"10 March 2014","conferenceDate":"10-13 Dec. 2013","accessionNumber":"14158159","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Real-time sliding mode control with neural networks for a doubly fed induction generator","confLoc":"Firenze, Italy","sourcePdf":"1627.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056983S","chronDate":"10-13 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6749719","isNumber":"6759837","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6749719","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6759837","articleId":"6760964","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":6760966,"authors":[{"name":"X.

As result, they are commonly used to model cultured neural network, and memristor-based neuromorphic computer chips that aim at replicating the scalability and functionalities of biological circuitries. These examples of SNNs, however, do not allow for the direct manipulation of the synaptic strengths (or weights) as required by existing training algorithms. Therefore, this paper presents an indirect training algorithm that, instead, is designed to manipulate input spike trains (stimuli) that can be implemented by patterns of blue light, or controlled input voltages, to induce the desired synaptic weights changes via STDP. The approach is demonstrated by training an SNN to control a virtual insect that seeks to reach a target location in an obstacle populated environment, without any prior control or navigation knowledge. The simulation results illustrate the feasibility and efficiency of the proposed indirect training algorithm for a biologically-plausible sensorimotor system.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spike-based indirect training of a spiking neural network-controlled virtual insect","doi":"10.1109/CDC.2013.6760966","endPage":"6805","displayPublicationTitle":"52nd IEEE Conference on Decision and Control","pdfPath":"/iel7/6749719/6759837/06760966.pdf","publicationTitle":"52nd IEEE Conference on Decision and Control","startPage":"6798","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CDC.2013.6760966","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6759837","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6760966","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neurons","Training","Insects","Sensors","Antennas","Biological neural networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["control system synthesis","learning (artificial intelligence)","mobile robots","neurocontrollers","path planning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["spike-based indirect training algorithm","spiking neural network-controlled virtual insect","SNNs","biological neuronal networks","biologically-plausible mechanisms","synaptic time-dependent plasticity","STDP","cultured neural network model","memristor-based neuromorphic computer chips","biological circuitry","synaptic strengths","indirect training algorithm","blue light pattern","obstacle populated environment","biologically-plausible sensorimotor system","controlled input voltages"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Spike-based indirect training of a spiking neural network-controlled virtual insect","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6760966/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 Dec. 2013","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6760966/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","conferenceDate":"10-13 Dec. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"10 March 2014","accessionNumber":"14157618","isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spike-based indirect training of a spiking neural network-controlled virtual insect","confLoc":"Firenze, Italy","sourcePdf":"1097.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071692S","chronDate":"10-13 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6749719","isNumber":"6759837","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6749719","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"6759837","articleId":"6760966","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6760980,"authors":[{"name":"Xuchao Lin","affiliation":["Division of Systems Engineering, Boston University"],"firstName":"Xuchao","lastName":"Lin","id":"38237321800"},{"name":"Christos G.

In a 2D mission space, such simple solutions can no longer be derived. An alternative is to optimally assign each agent a linear trajectory, motivated by the 1D analysis. We prove, however, that elliptical trajectories outperform linear ones. Therefore, we formulate a parametric optimization problem in which we seek to determine such trajectories.We show that the problem can be solved using Infinitesimal Perturbation Analysis (IPA) to obtain performance gradients on line and obtain a complete solution.

This information exchange is, however, limited by communication constraints, delays, and distortions in most practical problems. This paper presents a quantitative analysis of information (flow) in a well-known distributed resource allocation algorithm using concepts from Shannon information theory. For this purpose, an entropy-based measure is adopted to quantify information which is defined as uncertainty reduction. Then, information flow in a certain class of iterative algorithms is studied. The relationships between the rate and total amount of information exchanged, and convergence of the algorithm are investigated under certain assumptions. The concepts introduced and the obtained results are illustrated using numerical examples.","doi":"10.1109/CDC.2013.6761052","displayPublicationTitle":"52nd IEEE Conference on Decision and Control","pdfPath":"/iel7/6749719/6759837/06761052.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6759837","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CDC.2013.6761052","publicationTitle":"52nd IEEE Conference on Decision and Control","startPage":"7327","endPage":"7332","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An information-theoretic analysis of distributed resource allocation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6761052","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 Dec. 2013","displayDocTitle":"An information-theoretic analysis of distributed resource allocation","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6761052/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6761052/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","accessionNumber":"14158515","dateOfInsertion":"10 March 2014","conferenceDate":"10-13 Dec. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An information-theoretic analysis of distributed resource allocation","confLoc":"Firenze, Italy","sourcePdf":"0971.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072476S","chronDate":"10-13 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6749719","isNumber":"6759837","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6749719","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6759837","articleId":"6761052","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6761077,"authors":[{"name":"Dean Richert","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, University of California, San Diego, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Dean","lastName":"Richert","id":"37396314200"},{"name":"Jorge Cort\u00e9s","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, University of California, San Diego, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Jorge","lastName":"Cort\u00e9s","id":"37286603500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5717-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5714-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-1381-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0191-2216"}],"articleNumber":"6761077","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":44},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robustness"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["geometry","graph theory","linear programming","robust control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["integral input-to-state stable saddle-point dynamics","distributed linear programming","robustness properties","optimization variable","multiagent setting","communication noise","computation errors","agent knowledge mismatches","finite energy","communication graph","link failures"]}],"abstract":"This paper studies the robustness properties of a class of saddle-point dynamics for linear programming. This dynamics is distributed over a network in which every node controls one component of the optimization variable. In this multi-agent setting, communication noise, computation errors, and mismatches in the agents' knowledge about the problem data all enter into the dynamics as unmodeled disturbances. We show that the saddle-point dynamics is integral input-to-state stable and hence robust to disturbances of finite energy. This result also allows us to establish the robustness of the dynamics when the communication graph is recurrently connected because of link failures.

It is generally believed that high-voltage equilibria of such networks are stable, but the locations of these equilibria are unknown, as is the critical network load where stability is lost. Inspired by the \u201ccontrol by interconnection\u201d paradigm developed for port-Hamiltonian systems, we propose a novel droop-like inverter controller which is quadratic in the local voltage magnitude. Remarkably, under this controller the closed-loop network is again a well-posed electrical circuit. We find that the equilibria of the quadratic droop-controlled network are in exact correspondence with the solutions of a reduced power flow equation. For general network topologies, we study some simple yet insightful solutions of this equation, and for the frequently-encountered case of a parallel microgrid, we present a concise and closed-form condition for the existence of an exponentially stable high-voltage network equilibrium. Our condition establishes the existence of a critical inductive load for the network, which depends only on the network topology, admittances, and controller gains. We compare and contrast our design with the conventional droop controller, investigate the relationship between the two, and validate the robustness of our design through simulation.","doi":"10.1109/CDC.2013.6761093","publicationTitle":"52nd IEEE Conference on Decision and Control","displayPublicationTitle":"52nd IEEE Conference on Decision and Control","pdfPath":"/iel7/6749719/6759837/06761093.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CDC.2013.6761093","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6759837","startPage":"7582","endPage":"7589","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Voltage stabilization in microgrids via quadratic droop control","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6761093","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Voltage stabilization in microgrids via quadratic droop control","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 Dec. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6761093/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"10-13 Dec. 2013","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","accessionNumber":"14157841","dateOfInsertion":"10 March 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6761093/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Voltage stabilization in microgrids via quadratic droop control","confLoc":"Firenze, Italy","sourcePdf":"0084.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073819S","chronDate":"10-13 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6749719","isNumber":"6759837","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6749719","citationCount":"38","xplore-issue":"6759837","articleId":"6761093","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6761104,"authors":[{"name":"Jacopo Tani","affiliation":["Deparment of Mechanical Aerospace, and Nuclear Engineering, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Troy, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Jacopo","lastName":"Tani","id":"38548446100"},{"name":"Sandipan Mishra","affiliation":["Deparment of Mechanical Aerospace, and Nuclear Engineering, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Troy, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Sandipan","lastName":"Mishra","id":"37532698000"},{"name":"John Wen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Systems, and Computer Engineering, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, NY, USA"],"firstName":"John","lastName":"Wen","id":"37278935000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5717-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5714-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-1381-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0191-2216"}],"articleNumber":"6761104","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":65},"abstract":"This paper demonstrates the use of a slow-rate image sensor for control of a fast-rate beam steering system. The image sensor is modeled as an integrative intensity sensor, from which fast-rate dynamics may be estimated by appropriate motion-field extraction. These fast-rate state estimates obtained from the slow-rate image sensor are then used for a multirate model-following controller that achieves desired performance through state-matching. This is in contrast to traditional control schemes for fast-rate systems with image sensors, which rely on the slow-rate time-averaged output measurement during the exposure time of the image sensor (i.e., the first spatial moment of the acquired image), discarding the image blur as noise. We demonstrate that the proposed multirate feedback controller, which uses the entire intensity distribution at the image sensor, provides superior tracking performance than a similar multirate controller that uses only the first moment of the image (time-averaged output) as feedback measurements.","displayPublicationTitle":"52nd IEEE Conference on Decision and Control","pdfPath":"/iel7/6749719/6759837/06761104.pdf","startPage":"7654","endPage":"7659","publicationTitle":"52nd IEEE Conference on Decision and Control","doi":"10.1109/CDC.2013.6761104","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CDC.2013.6761104","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6759837","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6761104","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On multirate control of a fast-rate beam steering system using slow-rate image sensor feedback","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field-flow fractionation","Facsimile","Cameras","Barium","Noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["beam steering","control system synthesis","feature extraction","feedback","image restoration","image sensors","mirrors","motion estimation","optical control","state estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fast-rate beam steering system","slow-rate image sensor feedback","integrative intensity sensor","fast-rate dynamics","motion-field extraction","fast-rate state estimates","multirate model-following controller","state-matching","slow-rate time-averaged output measurement","image blur","multirate feedback controller","intensity distribution","feedback measurements","multirate feedback controller design strategy"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6761104/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 Dec. 2013","displayDocTitle":"On multirate control of a fast-rate beam steering system using slow-rate image sensor feedback","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6761104/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","accessionNumber":"14157605","dateOfInsertion":"10 March 2014","conferenceDate":"10-13 Dec. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On multirate control of a fast-rate beam steering system using slow-rate image sensor feedback","confLoc":"Firenze, Italy","sourcePdf":"2029.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054284S","chronDate":"10-13 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6749719","isNumber":"6759837","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6749719","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6759837","articleId":"6761104","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6761108,"authors":[{"name":"Filippo Cacace","affiliation":["Universit\u00e0 Campus Bio-Medico di Roma, Roma, Italy"],"firstName":"Filippo","lastName":"Cacace","id":"37269140200"},{"name":"Francesco Conte","affiliation":["Intelligent Electric Systems Laboratory, Universit\u00e0 degli studi di Genova, Genova, Italy"],"firstName":"Francesco","lastName":"Conte","id":"37085340988"},{"name":"Alfredo Germani","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Ingegneria e, Universit\u00e0 degli studi dell'Aquila, Coppito, (AQ), Italy"],"firstName":"Alfredo","lastName":"Germani","id":"37274965300"},{"name":"Giovanni Palombo","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Ingegneria e, Universit\u00e0 degli studi dell'Aquila, Coppito, (AQ), Italy"],"firstName":"Giovanni","lastName":"Palombo","id":"37085450084"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5717-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5714-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-1381-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0191-2216"}],"articleNumber":"6761108","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":37},"abstract":"This paper concerns with the state estimation problem of nonlinear systems with sampled noisy measurements.

The tagger is able to handle lexical items with multiple POS tags while also predicting POS tags of previously unseen words. A stochastic approach, Hidden Markov Model (HMM) with tri-gram probabilities was used as the training and tagging model. Linear Interpolation is used to smoothen the tri-gram probabilities while the Viterbi algorithm is used to decode the results of the HMM to decide on the best POS tags for each word. The tagger learns the lexical items (words and their possible POS tags) and the tri-gram probabilities using a POS tag annotated corpus. The tagger achieved an overall accuracy of 62%. Approximately 24% of the errors were for words whose POS tags have been unknown in the corpus. The lack of a Named Entity recognizer has also contributed to 10% of the overall error.","doi":"10.1109/ICTer.2013.6761168","publicationTitle":"2013 International Conference on Advances in ICT for Emerging Regions (ICTer)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 International Conference on Advances in ICT for Emerging Regions (ICTer)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6747516/6761138/06761168.pdf","startPage":"137","endPage":"143","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICTer.2013.6761168","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6761138","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6761168","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Learning a stochastic part of speech tagger for sinhala","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Learning a stochastic part of speech tagger for sinhala","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6761168/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-15 Dec. 2013","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6761168/","dateOfInsertion":"10 March 2014","publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","accessionNumber":"14157473","conferenceDate":"11-15 Dec. 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Learning a stochastic part of speech tagger for sinhala","confLoc":"Colombo, Sri Lanka","sourcePdf":"30LearningaStochasticPartofSpeech.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040231S","chronDate":"11-15 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6747516","isNumber":"6761138","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6747516","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6761138","articleId":"6761168","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-16"},{"_id":6761238,"authors":[{"name":"Ya-Ju Yu","affiliation":["Research Center for Information Technology Innovation, Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Ya-Ju","lastName":"Yu","id":"37405460300"},{"name":"Ching-Chih Chuang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Ching-Chih","lastName":"Chuang","id":"38542665200"},{"name":"Hsin-Peng Lin","affiliation":["Telecommunication Laboratories, Chunghwa Telecom Co., Ltd., Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Hsin-Peng","lastName":"Lin","id":"38542972000"},{"name":"Ai-Chun Pang","affiliation":["Research Center for Information Technology Innovation, Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Ai-Chun","lastName":"Pang","id":"37267352100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-0537-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-0536-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0742-1303"}],"articleNumber":"6761238","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":600},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6761238","abstract":"Recently, large-scale data centers are widely built to support various kinds of cloud services, which are mostly delivered by multicast. Even with multicast, cloud services may still generate a large amount of data traffic in some bottleneck links and, even worse, cause network congestion. Thus, how to reduce the redundancy of data transmissions to mitigate network congestion is essential. In addition to wired transmissions, modern data centers adopt wireless links to augment network capacity. Under the coexisting scenario of wired and wireless links, this paper studies multicast data delivery problem. Specifically, a multicast tree problem is defined, and the objective is to minimize the total multicast data traffic. We prove the problem is NP-hard and propose an efficient heuristic algorithm to solve the problem. A series of experiment results shows that our proposed algorithm is very effective, compared with an optimal solution designed for traditional wired data centers.","doi":"10.1109/LCN.2013.6761238","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6761208","startPage":"228","endPage":"235","pdfPath":"/iel7/6745315/6761208/06761238.pdf","publicationTitle":"38th

This paper aims to seek an effective caching decision policy to improve the content dissemination in ICN. We propose PopCache-a caching decision policy with respect to the content popularity-that allows an individual ICN router to cache content more or less in accordance with the popularity characteristic of the content. We propose an analytical model to evaluate the performance of different caching decision policies in terms of the server-hit rate and expected round-trip time. The analysis confirmed by simulation results shows that PopCache yields the lowest expected round-trip time compared with three benchmark caching decision policies, i.e., the always, fixed probability and path-capacity-based probability, and PopCache provides the server-hit rate comparable to the lowest ones.","doi":"10.1109/LCN.2013.6761239","publicationTitle":"38th Annual IEEE Conference on Local Computer Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"38th Annual IEEE Conference on Local Computer Networks","pdfPath":"/iel7/6745315/6761208/06761239.pdf","startPage":"236","endPage":"243","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCN.2013.6761239","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6761208","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"PopCache: Cache more or less based on content popularity for information-centric networking","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6761239","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 Oct. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6761239/","displayDocTitle":"PopCache: Cache more or less based on content popularity for information-centric networking","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","accessionNumber":"14157259","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6761239/","conferenceDate":"21-24 Oct. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"10 March 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"PopCache: Cache more or less based on content popularity for information-centric networking","confLoc":"Sydney, NSW, Australia","promoFlag":"true","sourcePdf":"p236suksomboon.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064492S","chronDate":"21-24 Oct. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6745315","isNumber":"6761208","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6745315","citationCount":"38","xplore-issue":"6761208","articleId":"6761239","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6761241,"authors":[{"name":"P\u00e5l Gr\u00f8nsund","affiliation":["Telenor, Snar\u00f8yveien 30, 1331 Fornebu, Norway"],"firstName":"P\u00e5l","lastName":"Gr\u00f8nsund"},{"name":"Paal E.

Because of the limited power source and small form factors, BASNs have distinguished design and operational challenges, particularly focusing on energy optimization. In this paper, an Energy-Delay-Distortion cross-layer design that aims at minimizing the total energy consumption subject to data delay deadline and distortion threshold constraints is proposed. The optimal encoding and transmission energy are computed to minimize the total energy consumption in a delay constrained wireless body area sensor network. This cross-layer framework is proposed, across Application-MAC-Physical layers, under a constraint that all successfully received packets must have their delay smaller than their corresponding delay deadline and with maximum distortion less than the application distortion threshold. Due to the complexity of the optimal-proposed solution, sub-optimal solutions are also proposed. These solutions have close-to-optimal performance with lower complexity. In this context, there is complexity/energy-consumption trade-off, as shown in the simulation results.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6761267/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 Oct. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"10 March 2014","accessionNumber":"14157255","htmlLink":"/document/6761267/","conferenceDate":"21-24 Oct. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Energy-aware cross-layer optimization for EEG-based wireless monitoring applications","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy-aware cross-layer optimization for EEG-based wireless monitoring applications","confLoc":"Sydney, NSW, Australia","promoFlag":"true","sourcePdf":"p356abdelhady.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.092672S","chronDate":"21-24 Oct. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6745315","isNumber":"6761208","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6745315","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"6761208","articleId":"6761267","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-26"},{"_id":6761268,"authors":[{"name":"Ming-Yuan Cheng","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Ming-Yuan","lastName":"Cheng","id":"38247194100"},{"name":"Yan-Bin Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yan-Bin","lastName":"Chen","id":"37085418014"},{"name":"Hung-Yu Wei","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Hung-Yu","lastName":"Wei","id":"37281361800"},{"name":"Winston K.G.

Data on the level of stress sustained by buildings and other critical infrastructure acquired during the event can significantly help in post-disaster recovery and assessment of buildings' structural integrity. While installing sensors to acquire such data is not difficult, ensuring that there is power to drive the sensors at the critical moment of the event is a challenge. In this paper, we propose an event-driven energy-harvesting (EDEH) wireless sensor network (WSN) in which the sensors are powered by the energy harvested from the consequence of the event, e.g. buildings shaking during an earthquake. The scarce amount of energy harvested during the short event occurrence time poses great challenges for the medium access control (MAC) design, which is the focus of our research. Furthermore, when all sensors harvest energy from the event, they become active simultaneously leading to serious channel contention problems. As such, we first examine the amount of harvestable energy and then show analytically that our MAC protocol is able to provide higher packet delivery ratio than conventional wireless technology, e.g. IEEE802.15.4.","doi":"10.1109/LCN.2013.6761268","publicationTitle":"38th Annual IEEE Conference on Local Computer Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"38th Annual IEEE Conference on Local Computer Networks","pdfPath":"/iel7/6745315/6761208/06761268.pdf","startPage":"364","endPage":"372","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6761208","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCN.2013.6761268","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6761268","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 Oct. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6761268/","displayDocTitle":"Event-driven energy-harvesting wireless sensor network for structural health monitoring","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","accessionNumber":"14157260","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6761268/","dateOfInsertion":"10 March 2014","conferenceDate":"21-24 Oct. 2013","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Event-driven energy-harvesting wireless sensor network for structural health monitoring","confLoc":"Sydney, NSW, Australia","promoFlag":"true","sourcePdf":"p364cheng.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047868S","chronDate":"21-24 Oct. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6745315","isNumber":"6761208","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6745315","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6761208","articleId":"6761268","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6761275,"authors":[{"name":"Muhammad Junaid Farooq","affiliation":["Cognet Lab, National University of Sciences & Technology (NUST), Islamabad, Pakistan"],"firstName":"Muhammad Junaid","lastName":"Farooq","id":"37086646723"},{"name":"Muddassar Hussain","affiliation":["Cognet Lab, National University of Sciences & Technology (NUST), Islamabad, Pakistan"],"firstName":"Muddassar","lastName":"Hussain","id":"37086648173"},{"name":"Junaid Qadir","affiliation":["Cognet Lab, National University of Sciences & Technology (NUST), Islamabad, Pakistan"],"firstName":"Junaid","lastName":"Qadir","id":"37298438800"},{"name":"Adeel Baig","affiliation":["Cognet Lab, National University of Sciences & Technology (NUST), Islamabad, Pakistan"],"firstName":"Adeel","lastName":"Baig","id":"37281980400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-0537-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-0536-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0742-1303"}],"articleNumber":"6761275","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":310},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference","Games","Unicast","Heuristic algorithms","Channel allocation","Resource management","Nash equilibrium"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","game theory","interference suppression","radiofrequency interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["game-theoretic spectrum allocation framework","mixed unicast-broadcast traffic profile","distributed cognitive radio networks","broadcast latency minimisation","interference minimization","access contention","network throughput","Nash equilibrium","sequential best response dynamics","Orbit radio testbed"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Broadcast Traffic","Spectrum Assignment","Cognitive Radio Networks","Unicast Traffic","Game Theory","Nash Equilibrium (NE)"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we present a game theoretic framework for spectrum allocation in distributed cognitive radio networks containing both unicast and broadcast traffic.

Our proposed spectrum allocation game is also formulated as a potential game and is guaranteed to converge to a Nash equilibrium if the sequential best response dynamics is followed.

As an immediate consequence, not only can we count hosts behind a NAT gateway but block TCP traffic from single hosts without blocking the gateway itself. Our work extends ideas from Bursztein, which we improve in terms of performance as well as matching quality and usability in practice. A theoretical runtime of O(log(n)) for matching packets against a database of n hosts is achieved. We empirically verify this result and conclude that our approach scales extremely well and is therefore suitable for at least medium-scale networks of a few thousand hosts.","doi":"10.1109/LCN.2013.6761302","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCN.2013.6761302","startPage":"647","endPage":"654","displayPublicationTitle":"38th Annual IEEE Conference on Local Computer Networks","pdfPath":"/iel7/6745315/6761208/06761302.pdf","publicationTitle":"38th Annual IEEE Conference on Local Computer Networks","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6761208","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"IP agnostic real-time traffic filtering and host identification using TCP timestamps","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 Oct. 2013","displayDocTitle":"IP agnostic real-time traffic filtering and host identification using TCP timestamps","conferenceDate":"21-24 Oct. 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"10 March 2014","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6761302/","accessionNumber":"14157229","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6761302/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"IP agnostic real-time traffic filtering and host identification using TCP timestamps","confLoc":"Sydney, NSW, Australia","promoFlag":"true","sourcePdf":"p647weingarten.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073468S","chronDate":"21-24 Oct. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6745315","isNumber":"6761208","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6745315","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"6761208","articleId":"6761302","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6761332,"authors":[{"name":"Mehdi Khabazian","affiliation":["Qatar Mobility Innovations Center (QMIC), Doha, Qatar"],"firstName":"Mehdi","lastName":"Khabazian","id":"37595022900"},{"name":"Nizar Zorba","affiliation":["Qatar Mobility Innovations Center (QMIC), Doha, Qatar"],"firstName":"Nizar","lastName":"Zorba","id":"38310931600"},{"name":"Hossam S.

We study the performance of the proposed mechanism through a queuing theory approach. Several performance metrics such as the service provider's revenue, call blocking and call deferral probabilities are determined, and the scheme is compared to a regular call admission control serving as a benchmark. The results show how much a joint dynamic pricing scheme can satisfy service providers in terms of increased revenue and congestion control, while keeping users satisfied in terms of their perceived quality of service.

This problem has a wide range of commercial applications and occurs when resources have to be shared or distributed fairly to several entities. We propose a new hybrid heuristic combining an iterative linear programming-based algorithm with a quantum particle swarm optimization. The iterative linear programming-based algorithm generates two sequences of upper and lower bounds, respectively, around the optimal value of the problem, in order to decrease the gap between the bounds and to converge to an optimal solution of the problem. To improve the efficiency of the approach we integrate local search techniques. In particular, we consider the quantum particle swarm optimization to enhance the solutions visited by the iterative method. The computational results show that the proposed approach can produce optimal or near-optimal solutions in a short and reasonable amount of running time.","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 2013 International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Systems Management (IESM)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6745854/6761346/06761362.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 2013 International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Systems Management (IESM)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6761346","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new hybrid heuristic for the 0\u20131 knapsack sharing problem","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 Oct. 2013","displayDocTitle":"A new hybrid heuristic for the 0\u20131 knapsack sharing problem","conferenceDate":"28-30 Oct. 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"13 March 2014","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6761362/","accessionNumber":"14160417","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6761362/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new hybrid heuristic for the 0\u20131 knapsack sharing problem","confLoc":"Agdal, Morocco","sourcePdf":"016238.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.103279S","chronDate":"28-30 Oct. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6745854","isNumber":"6761346","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6745854","xplore-issue":"6761346","articleId":"6761362","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"International Institute for Innovation, Industrial Engineering and Entrepreneurship - I4e2","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6761365,"authors":[{"name":"Maroua Nouiri","affiliation":["MMA Laboratory, INSAT Institute Carthage University, Tunis, Tunisia"],"firstName":"Maroua","lastName":"Nouiri","id":"37085901681"},{"name":"Abderezak Jemai","affiliation":["MMA Laboratory, INSAT Institute Carthage University, Tunis, Tunisia"],"firstName":"Abderezak","lastName":"Jemai","id":"38579340900"},{"name":"Ahmed Chiheb Ammari","affiliation":["MMA Laboratory, INSAT Institute Carthage University, Tunis, Tunisia"],"firstName":"Ahmed Chiheb","lastName":"Ammari","id":"37273818600"},{"name":"Abdelghani Bekrar","affiliation":["University of Lille Nord de France,UVHC.

Making the right routing and scheduling decisions may have a great impact on the efficiency of the system in terms of delay propagation. However, the time available for making these decisions is quite short: in few minutes a viable set of routes and schedules must be delivered to the dispatching system. In this paper, we assess the performance of a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) formulation exploited as a heuristic approach: we seek for the best feasible solution given a limited and predefined computation time. We run an experimental analysis on instances representing traffic in the Lille Flandres station, France. The results show that the approach tested is very promising, often finding the optimal solution to the instances tackled. Moreover, we show how the performance can be improved by tuning the parameters of the MILP solver.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Real-time train routing and scheduling through mixed integer linear programming: Heuristic approach","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 2013 International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Systems Management (IESM)","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 2013 International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Systems Management (IESM)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6745854/6761346/06761368.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6761346","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6761368","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6761368/","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 Oct. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Real-time train routing and scheduling through mixed integer linear programming: Heuristic approach","conferenceDate":"28-30 Oct. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6761368/","dateOfInsertion":"13 March 2014","publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","accessionNumber":"14160365","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Real-time train routing and scheduling through mixed integer linear programming: Heuristic approach","confLoc":"Agdal, Morocco","sourcePdf":"022194.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054188S","chronDate":"28-30 Oct. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6745854","isNumber":"6761346","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6745854","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6761346","articleId":"6761368","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"International Institute for Innovation, Industrial Engineering and Entrepreneurship - I4e2","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6761503,"authors":[{"name":"Zeineb Baklouti","affiliation":["UVHC - LAMIH, Valenciennes Cedex 9"],"firstName":"Zeineb","lastName":"Baklouti","id":"37086651357"},{"name":"David Duvivier","affiliation":["UVHC - LAMIH, Valenciennes Cedex 9"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Duvivier","id":"37086126070"},{"name":"Rabie Ben Atitallah","affiliation":["UVHC - LAMIH, Valenciennes Cedex 9"],"firstName":"Rabie","lastName":"Ben Atitallah","id":"37594768000"},{"name":"Abdelhakim Artiba","affiliation":["UVHC - LAMIH, Valenciennes Cedex 9"],"firstName":"Abdelhakim","lastName":"Artiba","id":"37064646100"},{"name":"Nicolas Belanger","affiliation":["Eurocopter Group, Marignane Cedex"],"firstName":"Nicolas","lastName":"Belanger","id":"37408061000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-2-9600532-4-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6761503","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":103},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Load modeling","Computational modeling","Real-time systems","Field programmable gate arrays","Data models","Hardware","Mathematical model"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["avionics","field programmable gate arrays","graph theory","reconfigurable architectures"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["real-time simulator","heterogeneous CPU-FPGA architecture","manufacturing process","verification and validation","V&V cycle","hardware designers","reconfigurable computing","acyclic graph","simulation project","synchronized models","hardware architecture","real-time constraint violation","avionic case-study"]}],"abstract":"Real-time computing systems are increasingly used in several industrial domains such as aerospace, avionic, rail, and automotive. During the manufacturing process, designers need development tools for the verification and the validation (V&V) of modern and complex systems. Today, the simulation phase is considered as an unavoidable part of the V&V cycle. In order to meet the application requirements in terms of increasing computation rate and real-time, dedicated simulators should be used. In the face of these challenges, hardware designers are directed towards reconfigurable computing with the usage of heterogeneous CPU/FPGA systems. However, there is a lack of real-time simulation environments able to deal with the execution of applications on such heterogeneous systems. This research investigates the problem of soft real-time simulation environment supporting CPU/FPGA hardware architecture. Our environment runs a simulation project as an acyclic graph of synchronized models. This project is monitored with a supervisor that integrates a heuristic allowing an efficient dynamic mapping on the hardware architecture in order to avoid real-time constraint violation. The monitoring kernel module ensures the calculation of cores' load. These values help the supervisor to take the decision of reconfiguration at runtime. The efficiency of our simulation environment is validated through an avionic case-study that imposes real-time constraints in the order of milliseconds.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Real-time simulator supporting heterogeneous CPU/FPGA architecture","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 2013 International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Systems Management (IESM)","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 2013 International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Systems Management (IESM)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6745854/6761346/06761503.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6761346","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6761503","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6761503/","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 Oct. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Real-time simulator supporting heterogeneous CPU/FPGA architecture","conferenceDate":"28-30 Oct. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6761503/","dateOfInsertion":"13 March 2014","publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","accessionNumber":"14160373","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Real-time simulator supporting heterogeneous CPU/FPGA architecture","confLoc":"Agdal, Morocco","sourcePdf":"157243.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.12672S","chronDate":"28-30 Oct. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6745854","isNumber":"6761346","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6745854","xplore-issue":"6761346","articleId":"6761503","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"International Institute for Innovation, Industrial Engineering and Entrepreneurship - I4e2","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":6761569,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The experiment result shows that the accuracy of paddy diseases identification is 91.46%.","doi":"10.1109/ICACSIS.2013.6761609","pdfPath":"/iel7/6746886/6761537/06761609.pdf","startPage":"403","endPage":"406","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 International Conference on Advanced Computer Science and Information Systems (ICACSIS)","publicationTitle":"2013 International Conference on Advanced Computer Science and Information Systems (ICACSIS)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICACSIS.2013.6761609","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6761537","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"I-PEDIA: Mobile application for paddy disease identification using fuzzy entropy and probabilistic neural network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6761609/","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-29 Sept. 2013","displayDocTitle":"I-PEDIA: Mobile application for paddy disease identification using fuzzy entropy and probabilistic neural network","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"13 March 2014","accessionNumber":"14160498","publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6761609/","conferenceDate":"28-29 Sept. 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"I-PEDIA: Mobile application for paddy disease identification using fuzzy entropy and probabilistic neural network","confLoc":"Sanur Bali, Indonesia","sourcePdf":"64.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054036S","chronDate":"28-29 Sept. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6746886","isNumber":"6761537","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6746886","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"6761537","articleId":"6761609","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6761610,"authors":[{"name":"Janjira Jojan","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Kasetsart University, Thailand"],"firstName":"Janjira","lastName":"Jojan","id":"37086739421"},{"name":"Anongnart Srivihok","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Kasetsart University, Thailand"],"firstName":"Anongnart","lastName":"Srivihok","id":"37550103700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-4692-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6761610","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":265},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6761610","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Breast cancer","Classification algorithms","Decision trees","Accuracy","Machine learning algorithms","Measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Bayes methods","cancer","decision trees","medical computing","medical information systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["imbalanced breast cancer data","feature selection","over-sampling technique","class imbalance problems","medical data","FOT","consistency subset evaluation","classification algorithms","decision tree","BayesNet","OneR"]}],"abstract":"Class imbalance problems have been found in many medical data in recent years. Data are imbalanced when the distributions of classes are highly imbalanced that means the number of instances of one class is very different to the other classes. Feature selection combined with over-sampling technique (FOT) is proposed to preprocess data before classifying our dataset, imbalanced breast cancer. We used feature selection techniques, Consistency Subset Evaluation, at the beginning to remove insignificant attributes of data. The remaining attributes were fed into over-sampling phase to adjust instances in the minority class. After preprocessed the dataset, we classified data using three classification algorithms, decision tree, BayesNet, and OneR. The f-values of classification data using FOT are 0.76, 0.638, and 0.64, respectively. These are greater than the f-values of three above classifications without FOT as, 0.561, 0.518, and 0.512, respectively. The experimental results indicated that FOT achieves better f-values than non-FOT preprocessing and have performed well in improving the performance of classifiers on this dataset, especially, decision tree.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6761537","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICACSIS.2013.6761610","publicationTitle":"2013 International Conference on Advanced Computer Science and Information Systems (ICACSIS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 International Conference on Advanced Computer Science and Information Systems (ICACSIS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6746886/6761537/06761610.pdf","startPage":"407","endPage":"412","doi":"10.1109/ICACSIS.2013.6761610","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Preprocessing of imbalanced breast cancer data using feature selection combined with over-sampling technique for classification","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-29 Sept. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Preprocessing of imbalanced breast cancer data using feature selection combined with over-sampling technique for classification","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"28-29 Sept. 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6761610/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","accessionNumber":"14160499","dateOfInsertion":"13 March 2014","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6761610/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Preprocessing of imbalanced breast cancer data using feature selection combined with over-sampling technique for classification","confLoc":"Sanur Bali, Indonesia","sourcePdf":"65.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053727S","chronDate":"28-29 Sept. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6746886","isNumber":"6761537","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6746886","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6761537","articleId":"6761610","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6762795,"authors":[{"name":"Per Hammarlund","affiliation":["Intel"],"bio":{"p":["Per Hammarlund is an Intel fellow.

The Qualcomm Hexagon DSP, now in its fifth generation, is used for both modem processing and multimedia acceleration. By offloading multimedia tasks such as voice, audio, sensor, and image processing from the CPU to the DSP, Hexagon achieves significant power savings. Hexagon features a unique architecture that combines application-specific instructions, a VLIW instruction set architecture, and hardware multithreading. The design approach is to maximize work per cycle for performance, but run at modest clock speeds and focus the implementation on low power. This article provides an overview of the Hexagon architecture.

These apps are generally delivered through app stores that let users post reviews. These reviews provide a rich data source you can leverage to understand user-reported issues. Researchers qualitatively studied 6,390 low-rated user reviews for 20 free-to-download iOS apps. They uncovered 12 types of user complaints. The most frequent complaints were functional errors, feature requests, and app crashes. Complaints about privacy and ethical issues and hidden app costs most negatively affected ratings. In 11 percent of the reviews, users attributed their complaints to a recent app update. This study provides insight into the user-reported issues of iOS apps, along with their frequency and impact, which can help developers better prioritize their limited quality assurance resources.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6762802/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 March 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"May-June  2015","dateOfInsertion":"23 April 2015","publicationDate":"May-June 2015","accessionNumber":"15072496","htmlLink":"/document/6762802/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"32","issue":"3","isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"What Do Mobile App Users Complain About?","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"What Do Mobile App Users Complain About?","sourcePdf":"mso2015030070.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037078S","chronDate":"May-June  2015","xplore-pub-id":"52","isNumber":"7093013","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"52","citationCount":"181","xplore-issue":"7093013","articleId":"6762802","onlineDate":"10 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6762809,"authors":[{"name":"Manel Collados","affiliation":["MTK Wireless Ltd, United Kingdom"],"bio":{"p":["Manel Collados (M'06), photograph and biography not available at time of publication."]},"firstName":"Manel","lastName":"Collados","id":"37271867000"},{"name":"HongLi Zhang","affiliation":["MediaTek Singapore Pte Ltd, Singapore"],"bio":{"p":["HongLi Zhang, photograph and biography not available at time of publication."]},"firstName":"HongLi","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37072454600"},{"name":"Bernard Tenbroek","affiliation":["MTK Wireless Ltd, United Kingdom"],"bio":{"p":["Bernard Tenbroek (S'94\u2013A'97\u2013M'09), photograph and biography not available at time of publication."]},"firstName":"Bernard","lastName":"Tenbroek","id":"38276993000"},{"name":"Hsiang-Hui Chang","affiliation":["MediaTek Inc., Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"bio":{"p":["Hsiang-Hui Chang, photograph and biography not available at time of publication."]},"firstName":"Hsiang-Hui","lastName":"Chang","id":"37280774200"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9480"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9670"}],"articleNumber":"6762809","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":1780},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society","url":"http://www.mtt.org/"}],"abstract":"A low-current direct-conversion transmitter (TX) is obtained by combining an efficient single-balanced 25% duty-cycle passive mixer with a low-bias single-ended driver. The nonlinearity of such architecture is aggravated by strong harmonics at the mixer output folding down to the fundamental frequency due to driver nonlinearity. To address this, a baseband mathematical model of the passive mixer plus nonlinear driver is derived. Then, based on this model, a novel digital-predistortion approach is disclosed. Implemented in 40-nm CMOS, the modulator and driver combined consume 45 mW when delivering a +3-dBm Release 99 WCDMA signal with 0.9% error vector magnitude (EVM) and -59-dBc adjacent-channel leakage power ratio (ACLR). In long-term evolution (LTE) mode, the TX delivers +0-dBm 10-MHz LTE 16QAM with -53-dBc ACLR and 1.2% EVM.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel7/22/6782343/06762809.pdf","startPage":"726","endPage":"731","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.2014.2309559","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.2014.2309559","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6782343","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6762809","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Low-Current Digitally Predistorted Direct-Conversion Transmitter With 25% Duty-Cycle Passive Mixer","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Mixers","Polynomials","Harmonic analysis","Modulation","Vectors","Mathematical model","Nonlinear distortion"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS integrated circuits","code division multiple access","driver circuits","Long Term Evolution","low-power electronics","mixers (circuits)","nonlinear network analysis","power amplifiers","quadrature amplitude modulation","radio transmitters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low current transmitter","digitally predistorted direct conversion transmitter","passive mixer","low bias single ended driver","mixer output harmonics","baseband mathematical model","nonlinear driver","CMOS integrated circuit","WCDMA signal","long term evolution","LTE","16QAM","size 40 nm","power 45 mW"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["CMOS","digital","driver","harmonic","linearity","long-term evolution (LTE)","mixer","modulator","nonlinear","passive","predistortion","transmitter (TX)","WCDMA"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6762809/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 March 2014","displayDocTitle":"A Low-Current Digitally Predistorted Direct-Conversion Transmitter With 25% Duty-Cycle Passive Mixer","volume":"62","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/6762809/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2014","accessionNumber":"14209886","dateOfInsertion":"02 April 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Low-Current Digitally Predistorted Direct-Conversion Transmitter With 25% Duty-Cycle Passive Mixer","sourcePdf":"tmtt-collados-2309559-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.170709S","chronDate":"April  2014","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"6782343","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"6782343","articleId":"6762809","onlineDate":"10 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6762810,"authors":[{"name":"Morteza S.

High-resolution image sensors often convey limited information due to the spatial redundancy between neighboring pixels. This paper proposes a mixed-signal AIC which compresses each nonoverlapping 4 \u00d7 4 pixel block in a 816 \u00d7 640 pixel prototype active-pixel sensor (APS) imager. It combines an energy-efficient charge-pump bit-image processor (BIP) with an area-efficient successive-approximation-register-single-slope (SAR-SS) hybrid analog-to-digital converter (ADC) via a charge-transfer-amplifier (CTA). The AIC is fully dynamic and consumes no static power. The ADC's capacitor array doubles as a computational device for parts of the compression algorithm which reduces its sampling rate by a factor of four. The compressed data contains direct edge information and can be decoded by a very simple receiver. The fabricated prototype consumes 12 pJ per pixel at 111 fps in the image compression mode and 48 pJ per pixel at 28.7 fps in raw data mode (9 b per pixel) under the same clock rate. To the best of our knowledge, this is the most energy-efficient compressive CMOS image sensor ever reported in the literature, thanks to the proposed AIC.","doi":"10.1109/JSSC.2014.2307063","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel7/4/6803076/06762815.pdf","startPage":"1210","endPage":"1222","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSSC.2014.2307063","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6803076","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 12 pJ/Pixel Analog-to-Information Converter Based 816 \u00d7 640 Pixel CMOS Image Sensor","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6762815","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 March 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6762815/","displayDocTitle":"A 12 pJ/Pixel Analog-to-Information Converter Based 816 \u00d7 640 Pixel CMOS Image Sensor","volume":"49","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 2014","accessionNumber":"14251303","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6762815/","dateOfInsertion":"21 April 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 12 pJ/Pixel Analog-to-Information Converter Based 816 \u00d7 640 Pixel CMOS Image Sensor","sourcePdf":"jssc-chen-2307063-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.092808S","chronDate":"May  2014","xplore-pub-id":"4","isNumber":"6803076","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"6803076","articleId":"6762815","onlineDate":"10 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6762823,"authors":[{"name":"Bertrand Le Gal","affiliation":["IPB/ENSEIRB-MATMECA, University of Bordeaux, Talence, France"],"firstName":"Bertrand Le","lastName":"Gal","id":"37085798812"},{"name":"Christophe Jego","affiliation":["IPB/ENSEIRB-MATMECA, University of Bordeaux, Talence, France"],"firstName":"Christophe","lastName":"Jego","id":"37271502500"},{"name":"J\u00e9r\u00e9mie Crenne","affiliation":["IPB/ENSEIRB-MATMECA, University of Bordeaux, Talence, France"],"firstName":"J\u00e9r\u00e9mie","lastName":"Crenne","id":"38267714400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1943-0663"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1943-0671"}],"articleNumber":"6762823","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":25,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1077},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6762823","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Graphics processing units","Decoding","Throughput","Iterative decoding","Kernel","Performance evaluation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["graphics processing units","parity check codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high throughput efficient approach","LDPC decoding process","low density parity check codes","GPU devices","graphics processing unit","LDPC code performance estimation","flooding-based decoding algorithm","computation parallelism","layered schedules","decoder iteration","memory access patterns","BER","bit error rate","correction performance","digital communication applications"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Graphic processing unit (GPU)","layered-based algorithm","low density parity check (LDPC)","throughput optimized"]}],"abstract":"Low density parity check (LDPC) decoding process is known as compute intensive. This kind of digital communication applications was recently implemented onto graphic processing unit (GPU) devices for LDPC code performance estimation and/or for real-time measurements. Overall previous studies about LDPC decoding on GPU were based on the implementation of the flooding-based decoding algorithm that provides massive computation parallelism. More efficient layered schedules were proposed in literature because decoder iteration can be split into sublayer iterations. These schedules seem to badly fit onto GPU devices due to restricted computation parallelism and complex memory access patterns. However, the layered schedules enable the decoding convergence to speed up by two.

The proposed antenna is capable of switching between a wide operating band of 2.63-3.7 GHz and four different subbands, which allows using it for sensing the entire band and then adjusting its bandwidth to select the suitable sub-band and prefilter out the other ones. The antenna is composed of a radiating element in the form of an inverted U fed by a microstrip line on its upper side. In order to achieve a selective frequency reconfiguration, four horizontal slots with integrated p-i-n diode switches are incorporated in the ground plane to act as reconfigurable filter. Some of the switches are used to alter the antenna bandwidth, while the others are employed to shift the operating band by varying the electrical length of the middle slots. To present the work, both simulated and measured results are presented, and a good agreement is achieved.","doi":"10.1109/LAWP.2014.2311114","publicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Wireless Propagation Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Wireless Propagation Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/7727/6719497/06762826.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LAWP.2014.2311114","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6719497","startPage":"515","endPage":"518","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Selective Frequency-Reconfigurable Antenna for Cognitive Radio Applications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6762826","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Selective Frequency-Reconfigurable Antenna for Cognitive Radio Applications","chronOrPublicationDate":"2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6762826/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 March 2014","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"13","publicationDate":"2014","accessionNumber":"14195009","dateOfInsertion":"26 March 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6762826/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Selective Frequency-Reconfigurable Antenna for Cognitive Radio Applications","sourcePdf":"lawp-ghanem-2311114-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.054071S","chronDate":"2014","xplore-pub-id":"7727","isNumber":"6719497","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7727","citationCount":"99","xplore-issue":"6719497","articleId":"6762826","onlineDate":"11 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6762832,"authors":[{"name":"Roman Bosshard","affiliation":["Power Electronic Systems Laboratory, ETH Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6245517/7027273/6762832/bossh-2311302-small.gif","p":["Roman Bosshard (S\u201910) received the M.Sc. degree from the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH) Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland, in 2011, where he is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree with the Power Electronic Systems Laboratory.","He focused on power electronics, ultrahigh-speed electrical drive systems, and control of mechatronic systems, during his studies.

multiband radio-over-fiber (RoF) systems have been investigated and illustrated for the first time. Nonlinear XM behaviors induced by a Mach-Zehnder modulator (MZM), including the intra-band XM between in-phase (I) and quadrature (Q) components of vector signals, as well as the inter-band XM between multiple bands of scalar/vector signals, have been studied by a closed-form theoretical analysis, and validated by experimental measurements. Consistent results have been obtained by both theoretical and experimental investigations. It was demonstrated that scalar signals only suffer from inter-band XM; whereas vector signals suffer from both intra- and inter-band XMs. Intra-band XM induces constellation compression distortion to vector signals, while inter-band XM induces eye-diagram degradation to scalar signals, and constellation scaling distortion to vector signals. To mitigate the signal distortions induced by data-dependent XM, arcsine pre-distortion technique was implemented to compensate the nonlinear response of MZM. Effective cancellations of both intra- and inter-band XM were achieved.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Investigation of Data-Dependent Channel Cross-Modulation in Multiband Radio-Over-Fiber Systems","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2014.2311115","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/50/6808425/06762838.pdf","startPage":"1861","endPage":"1871","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2014.2311115","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6808425","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6762838","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6762838/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 March 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"May15,  2014","displayDocTitle":"Investigation of Data-Dependent Channel Cross-Modulation in Multiband Radio-Over-Fiber Systems","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"32","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/6762838/","dateOfInsertion":"30 April 2014","publicationDate":"May15, 2014","accessionNumber":"14267038","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Investigation of Data-Dependent Channel Cross-Modulation in Multiband Radio-Over-Fiber Systems","sourcePdf":"jlt-wang-2311115-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.056181S","chronDate":"May15,  2014","isNumber":"6808425","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"18","articleId":"6762838","onlineDate":"11 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6762844,"authors":[{"name":"Wangwang Han","affiliation":["School of Electronic Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC), Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Wangwang","lastName":"Han","id":"37085457265"},{"name":"Xiaopeng Zhou","affiliation":["783 factory"],"firstName":"Xiaopeng","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37086635677"},{"name":"Jun Ouyang","affiliation":["School of Electronic Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC), Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Jun","lastName":"Ouyang","id":"37862421300"},{"name":"Yan Li","affiliation":["School of Electronic Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC), Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Yan","lastName":"Li","id":"37086636024"},{"name":"Rui Long","affiliation":["School of Electronic Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC), Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Rui","lastName":"Long","id":"37085373653"},{"name":"Feng Yang","affiliation":["School of Electronic Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC), Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Feng","lastName":"Yang","id":"37538169800"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1536-1225"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1548-5757"}],"articleNumber":"6762844","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":16,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1593},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society","url":"http://www.ieeeaps.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Antennas","MIMO","Inductors","Antenna measurements","Wireless LAN","Mutual coupling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna feeds","MIMO communication","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["six-port MIMO antenna system","WLAN access points application","high port isolation","multiple-input-multiple-output antenna system","vertically polarized antenna elements","horizontally polarized antenna elements","pyramidal metal structure","aperture-coupled feeding mechanism","quarter-wavelength chokes","parasitic grooves","frequency 5 GHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Access points application","high isolation","multiple-input\u2013multiple-output (MIMO)","WLAN 5-GHz band"]}],"abstract":"A six-port multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) antenna system with high port isolation for 5-GHz WLAN access points application is proposed in this letter.

Measured results show that more than 45 dB isolation can be obtained between any two elements of the system within the operating band.","doi":"10.1109/LAWP.2014.2310739","publicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Wireless Propagation Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Wireless Propagation Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/7727/6719497/06762844.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LAWP.2014.2310739","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6719497","startPage":"880","endPage":"883","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Six-Port MIMO Antenna System With High Isolation for 5-GHz WLAN Access Points","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6762844","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Six-Port MIMO Antenna System With High Isolation for 5-GHz WLAN Access Points","chronOrPublicationDate":"2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6762844/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 March 2014","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"13","publicationDate":"2014","accessionNumber":"14297385","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6762844/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61001029 and 10876007"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Six-Port MIMO Antenna System With High Isolation for 5-GHz WLAN Access Points","sourcePdf":"lawp-ouyang-2310739-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.075418S","chronDate":"2014","xplore-pub-id":"7727","isNumber":"6719497","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7727","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"6719497","articleId":"6762844","onlineDate":"11 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6762845,"authors":[{"name":"Yi Liu","affiliation":["Singapore University of Technology and Design, Singapore"],"firstName":"Yi","lastName":"Liu","id":"37085572453"},{"name":"Chau Yuen","affiliation":["Singapore University of Technology and Design, Singapore"],"firstName":"Chau","lastName":"Yuen","id":"37273147100"},{"name":"Xianghui Cao","affiliation":["Department of Control, State Key Laboratory of Industrial Control Technology, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Xianghui","lastName":"Cao","id":"37402405100"},{"name":"Naveed Ul Hassan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, SSE, Lahore University of Management Sciences (LUMS), Lahore, Pakistan"],"firstName":"Naveed Ul","lastName":"Hassan","id":"37530376200"},{"name":"Jiming Chen","affiliation":["Department of Control, State Key Laboratory of Industrial Control Technology, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Jiming","lastName":"Chen","id":"37086034189"}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2327-4662"},{"format":"CD","value":"2372-2541"}],"articleNumber":"6762845","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":134,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2161},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Media Access Protocol","Time division multiple access","Internet of Things","Scalability","Optimization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["access protocols","carrier sense multiple access","Internet","Internet of Things","optimisation","probability","time division multiple access"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["scalable hybrid MAC protocol","heterogeneous M2M network","medium access control protocol","machine-to-machine network","contention period","transmission period","hierarchical contending probability","convention-based p-persistent carrier sense multiple access mechanism","CSMA","reservation-based time-division multiple access mechanism","TDMA mechanism","optimization problem"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Homogeneous and heterogeneous networks","hybrid medium access control (MAC)","machine-to-machine (M2M) networks"]}],"abstract":"A robust and resilient medium access control (MAC) protocol is crucial for numerous machine-type devices to concurrently access the channel in a machine-to-machine (M2M) network. Simplex (reservation- or contention-based) MAC protocols are studied in most literatures which may not be able to provide a scalable solution for M2M networks with large number of heterogeneous devices. In this paper, a scalable hybrid MAC protocol, which consists of a contention period and a transmission period, is designed for heterogeneous M2M networks. In this protocol, different devices with preset priorities (hierarchical contending probabilities) first contend the transmission opportunities following the convention-based p-persistent carrier sense multiple access (CSMA) mechanism. Only the successful devices will be assigned a time slot for transmission following the reservation-based time-division multiple access (TDMA) mechanism. If the devices failed in contention at previous frame, to ensure the fairness among all devices, their contending priorities will be raised by increasing their contending probabilities at the next frame. To balance the tradeoff between the contention and transmission period in each frame, an optimization problem is formulated to maximize the channel utility by finding the key design parameters: the contention duration, initial contending probability, and the incremental indicator. Analytical and simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed hybrid MAC protocol.","doi":"10.1109/JIOT.2014.2310425","publicationTitle":"IEEE Internet of Things Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Internet of Things Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/6488907/6810798/06762845.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JIOT.2014.2310425","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6810798","startPage":"99","endPage":"111","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of a Scalable Hybrid MAC Protocol for Heterogeneous M2M Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6762845","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Design of a Scalable Hybrid MAC Protocol for Heterogeneous M2M Networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6762845/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 March 2014","isJournal":true,"volume":"1","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Feb. 2014","accessionNumber":"14282881","dateOfInsertion":"06 May 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of a Scalable Hybrid MAC Protocol for Heterogeneous M2M Networks","sourcePdf":"jiot-yuen-2310425-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.046505S","chronDate":"Feb.  2014","isNumber":"6810798","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6488907","citationCount":"134","articleId":"6762845","onlineDate":"11 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6762853,"authors":[{"name":"Andrew Burton","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering and Environment, Optical Communications Research Group, Northumbria University, Newcastle-upon-Tyne, U.K."],"firstName":"Andrew","lastName":"Burton","id":"38242346800"},{"name":"Hoa Le Minh","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering and Environment, Optical Communications Research Group, Northumbria University, Newcastle-upon-Tyne, U.K."],"firstName":"Hoa","lastName":"Le Minh","id":"37269845400"},{"name":"Zabih Ghassemlooy","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering and Environment, Optical Communications Research Group, Northumbria University, Newcastle-upon-Tyne, U.K."],"firstName":"Zabih","lastName":"Ghassemlooy","id":"37267374400"},{"name":"Edward Bentley","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering and Environment, Optical Communications Research Group, Northumbria University, Newcastle-upon-Tyne, U.K."],"firstName":"Edward","lastName":"Bentley","id":"37845402200"},{"name":"Carmen Botella","affiliation":["Group of Information and Communication Systems, Institute of Robotics and Information and Communication Technologies, University of Valencia, Valencia, Spain"],"firstName":"Carmen","lastName":"Botella","id":"37284757900"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1041-1135"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0174"}],"articleNumber":"6762853","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":127,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2072},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Photonics Society","url":"http://www.PhotonicsSociety.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Optical transmitters","Bit error rate","Receivers","Light emitting diodes","Lighting","Optical signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplitude shift keying","light emitting diodes","MIMO communication","optical communication","optical links","optical receivers","optical transmitters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["visible light communications","MIMO","indoor visible light nonimaging multiple-input multiple-output system","aggregate error free bit rate","white LED transmitters","ON-OFF keying nonreturn zero format","independent nonimaging optical receivers","basic channel inversion","advanced space time techniques","bit error rate","ISO lighting standards","home environment","office environment","bit rate 50 Mbit/s","distance 2 m","bit rate 12.5 Mbit/s"]},{"kwd":["VLC","MIMO","nonimaging","ZF","pseudoinverse","MMSE","V-BLAST"]}],"abstract":"This letter reports the experimental demonstration of an indoor visible light nonimaging multiple-input multiple-output system with an aggregate error free bit rate of 50 Mb/s over a distance of 2 m.

With two low power white LEDs each having a 3 dB modulation bandwidth of 8 MHz, data transmission of up to 40 Mbits/s ( 20 Mbaud) is demonstrated. For an average received electrical signal power of -12.5 dBm and 2\u00d710\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">4</sup>\n data symbols, the measured symbol error rate at 20 Mbaud is 7 \u00d710\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">-2</sup>\n and 5 \u00d710\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">-5</sup>\n at 10 Mbaud ( 20 Mbits/s) without any error control coding. The GSSK technique is experimentally shown to be most suitable for a fixed configuration as its performance is quite sensitive to receiver mobility.","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2014.2310499","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/50/6808425/06762861.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2014.2310499","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6808425","startPage":"1960","endPage":"1965","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Demonstration of the Merit and Limitation of Generalised Space Shift Keying for Indoor Visible Light Communications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6762861","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Demonstration of the Merit and Limitation of Generalised Space Shift Keying for Indoor Visible Light Communications","chronOrPublicationDate":"May15,  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6762861/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 March 2014","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"32","issue":"10","publicationDate":"May15, 2014","accessionNumber":"14280673","dateOfInsertion":"05 May 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6762861/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Demonstration of the Merit and Limitation of Generalised Space Shift Keying for Indoor Visible Light Communications","sourcePdf":"jlt-popoola-2310499-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.082897S","chronDate":"May15,  2014","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"6808425","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"37","xplore-issue":"6808425","articleId":"6762861","onlineDate":"11 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6762862,"authors":[{"name":"Bin Xu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Imperial College London, London, U.K."],"firstName":"Bin","lastName":"Xu","id":"38513151500"},{"name":"Wasim Khouri","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Imperial College London, London, U.K."],"firstName":"Wasim","lastName":"Khouri","id":"37086630938"},{"name":"Kristel Fobelets","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Imperial College London, London, U.K."],"firstName":"Kristel","lastName":"Fobelets","id":"38336504500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0741-3106"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0563"}],"articleNumber":"6762862","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":20,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":635},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Electron Devices Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/eds/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Silicon","Temperature measurement","Electrical resistance measurement","Arrays","Power generation","Conductivity","Doping"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["elemental semiconductors","nanowires","semiconductor doping","semiconductor quantum wires","silicon","thermoelectric conversion"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy harvesting","surface depletion-inversion effects removal","power factor","post-nanowire-etch spin-on-doping","metal assisted chemical etching","two-sided silicon nanowire array-bulk thermoelectric power generator","temperature 37 degC","power 3.5 muW","size 23 mum","size 24 mum"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Energy harvesting","power","silicon nanowire","thermoelectric."]},{"kwd":["Energy harvesting","power","silicon nanowire","thermoelectric"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6762862","abstract":"To improve the output power of n-and p-type Si nanowire array (NWA)/bulk thermoelectric power generators (TEGs) fabricated using metal assisted chemical etching, post-nanowire-etch spin-on-doping (SOD), and arrays on both sides of the bulk are used.

plays a key role in optical Network-on-Chip (ONoC) architecture. Existing passive OINs based on wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) are popularly employed. However, the scalability of these passive OINs is limited by the number of wavelengths and large insertion loss induced by the waveguide crossings. In this paper, we propose a novel Passive OIN based on two-layer architecture, POINT, for ONoC architecture. POINT leverages space division multiplexing (SDM) to assist WDM in eliminating blocking. The inter-layer communication in POINT relies on the inter-layer coupler, which contributes to reduce crossing losses. POINT features a modular and scalable design, in which the proposed SDM-based cell (SBC) is used as the basic building block to construct POINT with efficient wavelength assignment. Furthermore, SBCs of different sizes provide different options for constructing POINT. Comparisons with existing passive OINs confirm that POINT can provide an optimal choice with the balance between the number of wavelengths, area overhead, and insertion loss for the same size.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6762864/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 March 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"May1,  2014","volume":"32","issue":"9","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"14219623","dateOfInsertion":"07 April 2014","publicationDate":"May1, 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6762864/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A Novel Two-Layer Passive Optical Interconnection Network for On-Chip Communication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel Two-Layer Passive Optical Interconnection Network for On-Chip Communication","sourcePdf":"jlt-gu-2311119-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.079108S","chronDate":"May1,  2014","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"6781021","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"6781021","articleId":"6762864","onlineDate":"11 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6762877,"authors":[{"name":"Yogesh Kumar","affiliation":["Department of Physics, Indian Institute of Technology Delhi, New Delhi, India"],"firstName":"Yogesh","lastName":"Kumar","id":"37085659571"},{"name":"M.

The optimized system computes dense local features, using the scale-invariant feature transform on the HSV color space, builds a visual dictionary of 10000 visual words by using the hierarchical k-means clustering and finally classifies the food images with a linear support vector machine classifier.

Regression","abstract":"Super-resolution mapping (SRM) is a promising technique to generate a fine resolution land cover map from coarse fractional images by predicting the spatial locations of different land cover classes at subpixel scale. In most cases, SRM is accomplished by using the spatial dependence principle, which is a simple method to describe the spatial patterns of different land cover classes. However, the spatial dependence principle used in existing SRM models does not fully reflect the real-world situations, making the resultant fine resolution land cover map often have uncertainty. In this paper, an example-based SRM model using support vector regression (SVR_SRM) was proposed. Without directly using an explicit formulation to describe the prior information about the subpixel spatial pattern, SVR_SRM generates a fine resolution land cover map from coarse fractional images, by learning the nonlinear relationships between the coarse fractional pixels and corresponding labeled subpixels from the selected best-match training data. Based on the experiments of two subset images of National Land Cover Database (NLCD) 2001 and a subset of real hyperspectral Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) image, the performance of SVR_SRM was evaluated by comparing with the traditional pixel-based hard classification (HC) and several existing typical SRM algorithms. The results show that SVR_SRM can generate fine resolution land cover maps with more detailed spatial information and higher accuracy at different spatial scales.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6762884/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 March 2014","dateOfInsertion":"22 April 2014","publicationDate":"April 2014","accessionNumber":"14251344","volume":"7","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Example-Based Super-Resolution Land Cover Mapping Using Support Vector Regression","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Example-Based Super-Resolution Land Cover Mapping Using Support Vector Regression","sourcePdf":"jstars-zhang-2305652-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.049051S","chronDate":"April  2014","isNumber":"6803891","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4609443","citationCount":"41","articleId":"6762884","onlineDate":"11 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-30"},{"_id":6762892,"authors":[{"name":"Stefan P.

This development is driven by the growing share of electrical power generation by renewable energy sources that are located far from load centers and the increased use of distributed power generators in the distribution grid. Power converters that transfer the electric energy between voltage levels and control the power flow in dc grids will be key components in these systems. The recently presented modular multilevel dc converter (M2DC) and the three-phase dual-active bridge converter (DAB) are benchmarked for this task. Three scenarios are examined: a 15 MW converter for power conversion from an HVDC grid to an MVDC grid of a university campus, a gigawatt converter for feeding the energy from an MVDC collector grid of a wind farm into the HVDC grid, and a converter that acts as a power controller between two HVDC grids with the same nominal voltage level. The operation and degrees of freedom of the M2DC are investigated in detail aiming for an optimal design of this converter. The M2DC and the DAB converter are thoroughly compared for the given scenarios in terms of efficiency, amount of semiconductor devices, and expense on capacitive storage and magnetic components.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6762892/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 March 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2015","volume":"30","issue":"1","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"14543418","dateOfInsertion":"26 August 2014","publicationDate":"Jan. 2015","htmlLink":"/document/6762892/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Comparison of the Modular Multilevel DC Converter and the Dual-Active Bridge Converter for Power Conversion in HVDC and MVDC Grids","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparison of the Modular Multilevel DC Converter and the Dual-Active Bridge Converter for Power Conversion in HVDC and MVDC Grids","sourcePdf":"tpel-engel-2310656-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.105846S","chronDate":"Jan.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"6883248","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"256","xplore-issue":"6883248","articleId":"6762892","onlineDate":"11 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-24"},{"_id":6762896,"authors":[{"name":"Huaqun Wang","affiliation":["Chinese Academy of Sciences, Institute of Information Engineering, China","School of Information Engineering, Dalian Ocean University, Dalian, China"],"firstName":"Huaqun","lastName":"Wang","id":"37538485600"}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1939-1374"},{"format":"CD","value":"2372-0204"}],"articleNumber":"6762896","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":161,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2902},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Protocols","Servers","Cloud computing","Security","Distributed databases","Computational modeling","Indexes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","cryptographic protocols","data integrity","formal verification","private key cryptography","public key cryptography","storage management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["identity-based distributed provable data possession","multicloud storage","outsourced data","multicloud servers","integrity checking protocol","remote data integrity checking model","formal system model","security model","bilinear pairings","ID-DPDP protocol","public verification","delegated verification","private verification","computational Diffie-Hellman problem","CDH problem"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cloud computing","provable data possession","identity-based cryptography","distributed computing","bilinear pairings"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6762896","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Services Computing","pdfPath":"/iel7/4629386/7080963/06762896.pdf","startPage":"328","endPage":"340","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSC.2014.1","doi":"10.1109/TSC.2014.1","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7080963","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Services Computing","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Identity-Based Distributed Provable Data Possession in Multicloud Storage","abstract":"Remote data integrity checking is of crucial importance in cloud storage. It can make the clients verify whether their outsourced data is kept intact without downloading the whole data. In some application scenarios, the clients have to store their data on multicloud servers. At the same time, the integrity checking protocol must be efficient in order to save the verifier's cost. From the two points, we propose a novel remote data integrity checking model: ID-DPDP (identity-based distributed provable data possession) in multicloud storage. The formal system model and security model are given. Based on the bilinear pairings, a concrete ID-DPDP protocol is designed. The proposed ID-DPDP protocol is provably secure under the hardness assumption of the standard CDH (computational Diffie-Hellman) problem. In addition to the structural advantage of elimination of certificate management, our ID-DPDP protocol is also efficient and flexible. Based on the client's authorization, the proposed ID-DPDP protocol can realize private verification, delegated verification, and public verification.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6762896/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 March 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"March-April  2015","volume":"8","issue":"2","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15036079","dateOfInsertion":"11 April 2019","publicationDate":"March-April 2015","htmlLink":"/document/6762896/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Identity-Based Distributed Provable Data Possession in Multicloud Storage","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Identity-Based Distributed Provable Data Possession in Multicloud Storage","sourcePdf":"tsc-wang-1-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047061S","chronDate":"March-April  2015","isNumber":"7080963","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4629386","citationCount":"161","articleId":"6762896","onlineDate":"11 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6762897,"authors":[{"name":"Haipeng Dai","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Technology, Nanjing University, Nanjing, P.R.

Most existing works overlooked the impacts of node speed and battery capacity. However, we find that if the constraints of node speed and battery capacity are considered, the continuous operation of nodes may never be guaranteed, which invalidates the traditional energy provisioning concept. In this paper, we propose a novel metric-Quality of Energy Provisioning (QoEP)-to characterize the expected portion of time that a node sustains normal operation by taking into account node speed and battery capacity. To avoid confining the analysis to a specific mobility model, we study spatial distribution instead. As there exist more than one mobility models corresponding to the same spatial distribution, and different mobility models typically lead to different QoEPs, we investigate upper and lower bounds of QoEP in 1D and 2D cases. We derive tight upper and lower bounds of QoEP for 1D case with a single source, and tight lower bounds and loose upper bounds for general 1D and 2D cases with multiple sources. Finally, we perform extensive simulations to verify our theoretical findings.","doi":"10.1109/TPDS.2014.2310484","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/71/7010070/06762897.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPDS.2014.2310484","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7010070","startPage":"527","endPage":"537","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Quality of Energy Provisioning for Wireless Power Transfer","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6762897","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Quality of Energy Provisioning for Wireless Power Transfer","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6762897/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 March 2014","isJournal":true,"volume":"26","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 2015","accessionNumber":"14863868","dateOfInsertion":"14 January 2015","htmlLink":"/document/6762897/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Quality of Energy Provisioning for Wireless Power Transfer","sourcePdf":"tpds-dai-2310484-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.07797S","chronDate":"Feb.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"71","isNumber":"7010070","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"71","citationCount":"53","xplore-issue":"7010070","articleId":"6762897","onlineDate":"11 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6762899,"authors":[{"name":"Chung-Yang Chen","affiliation":["Dept. of Information Management, National Central University, Jhong-Li City, Tao-Yuan, Taiwan"],"bio":{"p":["Chung-Yang Chen is an Associate Professor with the Department of Information Management and the Director of the Computing Center, The School of Management, National Central University, Taiwan.

A team process known as the meetings-flow (MF) approach has recently been introduced in software capstone projects in engineering programs at various institutions. In undergraduate science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) curricula that emphasize team- and project-based learning, the MF approach serves as a macro-level instructional tool to guide students in holistically designing and directing collaborative project development. Previous studies on MF have shown the technical benefits of monitoring student work and product quality. This study investigated the approach further, from the perspective of team management. The effects of MF were examined through an experiment with team-related hypotheses. The results revealed that MF significantly enhances a team's communication and coordination and balances members' contributions by giving mutual support and effort. It has relatively less influence, however, on student team cohesion.","doi":"10.1109/TE.2014.2305918","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Education","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Education","pdfPath":"/iel7/13/6869066/06762899.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TE.2014.2305918","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6869066","startPage":"201","endPage":"208","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Effects of the Meetings-Flow Approach on Quality Teamwork in the Training of Software Capstone Projects","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6762899","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Effects of the Meetings-Flow Approach on Quality Teamwork in the Training of Software Capstone Projects","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6762899/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 March 2014","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"57","issue":"3","publicationDate":"Aug. 2014","accessionNumber":"14500969","dateOfInsertion":"31 July 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6762899/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001868","fundingName":"National Science Council","grantNumber":"101-2511-S-008-009"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Effects of the Meetings-Flow Approach on Quality Teamwork in the Training of Software Capstone Projects","sourcePdf":"te-chen-2305918-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.117057S","chronDate":"Aug.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"13","isNumber":"6869066","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"13","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"6869066","articleId":"6762899","onlineDate":"11 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6762907,"authors":[{"name":"Hou-Tzu Huang","affiliation":["Institute of Photonic System National Chiao Tung University, Tainan, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Hou-Tzu","lastName":"Huang","id":"38469159300"},{"name":"Po-Tsung Shih","affiliation":["Corning Incorporated, Corning Research Center Taiwan, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Po-Tsung","lastName":"Shih","id":"37085634895"},{"name":"Chun-Ting Lin","affiliation":["Institute of Photonic System National Chiao Tung University, Tainan, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chun-Ting","lastName":"Lin","id":"37291397400"},{"name":"Yu-Hsuan Cheng","affiliation":["Institute of Photonic System National Chiao Tung University, Tainan, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yu-Hsuan","lastName":"Cheng","id":"37086634459"},{"name":"Wan-Ling Liang","affiliation":["Institute of Photonic System National Chiao Tung University, Tainan, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Wan-Ling","lastName":"Liang","id":"37086627556"},{"name":"Chun-Hung Ho","affiliation":["Institute of Photonic System National Chiao Tung University, Tainan, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chun-Hung","lastName":"Ho","id":"37599717500"},{"name":"Chia-Chien Wei","affiliation":["Department of Photonics, National Sun Yat-Sen University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chia-Chien","lastName":"Wei","id":"37419349200"},{"name":"Anthony Ng'oma","affiliation":["Corning Incorporated, Corning, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Anthony","lastName":"Ng'oma","id":"37403057600"}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1943-0655"},{"format":"CD","value":"1943-0647"}],"articleNumber":"6762907","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1273},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Photonics Society","url":"http://www.PhotonicsSociety.org"}],"graphicalAbstract":{"summary":"Experimental setup of the 60-GHz 2X2MIMO RoF system.","type":"graphic","fileSize":"36KB","file":"/ielx7/4563994/6809260/6762907/graphical_abstract/jphot-gagraphic-2310222.gif","coverImage":""},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","MIMO","Optical fibers","Wireless communication","Optical receivers","Adaptive optics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["least squares approximations","MIMO systems","OFDM modulation","quadrature amplitude modulation","radio-over-fibre"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO OFDM-RoF system","LMS-based equalizer","I/Q imbalance compensation","multiple-input-multiple-output technology","orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing radio over fiber system","MIMO wireless technology","least mean squares algorithm","16-QAM OFDM signal transmissions","32-QAM OFDM signal transmissions","forward error correction threshold","bit-loading algorithm","frequency 60 GHz","distance 25 km","distance 3.5 m"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Fiber optics communications","radio-over-fiber","60 GHz","MIMO","LMS"]}],"abstract":"Multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) technology is a promising method to increase spectral efficiency in wireless communications.

In this paper, an energy-efficiency model is first proposed for multiple-input-multiple-output orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (MIMO-OFDM) mobile multimedia communication systems with statistical QoS constraints. Employing the channel-matrix singular value decomposition (SVD) method, all subchannels are classified by their channel characteristics. Furthermore, the multichannel joint optimization problem in conventional MIMO-OFDM communication systems is transformed into a multitarget single-channel optimization problem by grouping all subchannels. Therefore, a closed-form solution of the energy-efficiency optimization is derived for MIMO-OFDM mobile multimedia communication systems. As a consequence, an energy-efficiency optimized power allocation (EEOPA) algorithm is proposed to improve the energy efficiency of MIMO-OFDM mobile multimedia communication systems. Simulation comparisons validate that the proposed EEOPA algorithm can guarantee the required QoS with high energy efficiency in MIMO-OFDM mobile multimedia communication systems.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2014.2310773","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2014.2310773","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/6832681/06762913.pdf","startPage":"2127","endPage":"2138","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6832681","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy-Efficiency Optimization for MIMO-OFDM Mobile Multimedia Communication Systems With QoS Constraints","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Energy-Efficiency Optimization for MIMO-OFDM Mobile Multimedia Communication Systems With QoS Constraints","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6762913/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun  2014","isJournal":true,"volume":"63","issue":"5","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jun 2014","accessionNumber":"14379480","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6762913/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 March 2014","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)","grantNumber":"61103177 and 61271224"},{"fundingName":"NFSC Major International Joint Research Project","grantNumber":"61210002"},{"fundingName":"National 863 High-Technology Program of China","grantNumber":"2009AA01Z239"},{"fundingName":"Chinese Ministry of Science and Technology","grantNumber":"0903 and 2014DFA11640"},{"fundingName":"Hubei Provincial Science and Technology Department","grantNumber":"2011BFA004"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"2011QN020"},{"fundingName":"Chinese Ministry of Education Opening Project of the Key Laboratory of Cognitive Radio and Information Processing at Guilin University of Electronic Technology","grantNumber":"2013KF01"},{"fundingName":"EU FP7-PEOPLE-IRSES through Project S2EuNet","grantNumber":"247083"},{"fundingName":"Project WiNDOW","grantNumber":"318992"},{"fundingName":"Project CROWN","grantNumber":"610524"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy-Efficiency Optimization for MIMO-OFDM Mobile Multimedia Communication Systems With QoS Constraints","sourcePdf":"tvt-ge-2310773-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.093115S","chronDate":"Jun  2014","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"6832681","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"86","xplore-issue":"6832681","articleId":"6762913","onlineDate":"11 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6762917,"authors":[{"name":"Bo Peng","affiliation":["School of Electronic Science and Engineering, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/19/6873368/6762917/peng-2308031-small.gif","p":["Bo Peng (S'12) received the B.S. degree in information engineering and the M.S. degree in electrical engineering degree from the National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China, in 2008 and 2010, respectively, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree in information and communication engineering with the School of Electronic Science and Engineering.","His current research interests include nonstationary signal processing, micro-Doppler analysis, detection, estimation, and imaging of nonstatic targets for radar systems, and radar target recognition."]},"firstName":"Bo","lastName":"Peng","id":"37076183300"},{"name":"Xizhang Wei","affiliation":["School of Electronic Science and Engineering, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/19/6873368/6762917/wei-2308031-small.gif","p":["Xizhang Wei received the B.S. and Ph.D. degrees from the National University of Defense Technology (NUDT), Changsha, China, in 1998 and 2002, respectively.","He is currently a Professor with the School of Electronic Science and Engineering, NUDT.

Small vibrations introduce phase modulation in radar echoes, which is referred to as micro-Doppler (m-D) phenomenon and can be modeled as sinusoidal frequency-modulated (SFM) signal. Such phase modulation induced by vibrations consists of multiple frequency components; moreover, the modulation is usually rather weak. Present parametric estimators are difficult to estimate so many parameters of every frequency component, while nonparametric approaches suffer from low precision. This paper considers the analysis of SFM signal with weak and multiple frequency components modulation on phase term. We first define the SFM signal space to bridge a gap between the SFM signal analysis and classical signal processing methods. Based on the defined signal space, a novel m-D analysis method, i.e., the sinusoidal frequency modulation Fourier transform (SFMFT), is presented. With the operations acting directly on the phase term of SFM signal, SFMFT gives the frequency spectrum of vibration traces. Unlike the existing methods, which apply a sliding short-time window to perform an instantaneous approximation, the proposed method makes use of the global data, which can provide a longer integral period gain, and consequently improves the estimation performance significantly. Simulation results indicate that the proposed method outperforms the existing methods in the spectrum accuracy, the range of estimable vibration amplitude/frequency, and the computation complexity.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","pdfPath":"/iel7/19/6873368/06762917.pdf","startPage":"2188","endPage":"2199","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","doi":"10.1109/TIM.2014.2308031","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIM.2014.2308031","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6873368","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6762917","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Sinusoidal Frequency Modulation Fourier Transform for Radar-Based Vehicle Vibration Estimation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Vibrations","Frequency modulation","Vehicles","Fourier transforms","Roads","Radar tracking"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplitude estimation","discrete Fourier transforms","Doppler radar","FM radar","frequency estimation","radar cross-sections","radar signal processing","road vehicle radar","vibrations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sinusoidal frequency modulation Fourier transform","radar-based vehicle vibration estimation","phase modulation","radar echoes","micro Doppler phenomenon","sinusoidal frequency-modulated signal","SFM signal analysis","multiple frequency components","parametric estimators","phase term","signal space","m-D analysis method","SFMFT","sliding short-time window","instantaneous approximation","integral period gain","vibration amplitude estimation","vibration frequency estimation","computation complexity","discrete fractional Fourier transform"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Discrete fractional Fourier transform","joint time-frequency distribution (JTFD)","micro-Doppler (m-D)","sinusoidal frequency modulation Fourier transform (SFMFT)","sinusoidal frequency-modulated (SFM) signal space","vibration spectrum."]},{"kwd":["Discrete fractional Fourier transform","joint time-frequency distribution (JTFD)","micro-Doppler (m-D)","sinusoidal frequency modulation Fourier transform (SFMFT)","sinusoidal frequency-modulated (SFM) signal space","vibration spectrum"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6762917/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 March 2014","displayDocTitle":"A Sinusoidal Frequency Modulation Fourier Transform for Radar-Based Vehicle Vibration Estimation","volume":"63","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/6762917/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","accessionNumber":"14513284","dateOfInsertion":"07 August 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61271442 and 61302148"},{"fundingName":"National Science Fund for Distinguished Young Scholars of China","grantNumber":"61025006"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Sinusoidal Frequency Modulation Fourier Transform for Radar-Based Vehicle Vibration Estimation","sourcePdf":"tim-peng-2308031-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.089178S","chronDate":"Sept.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"19","isNumber":"6873368","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"19","citationCount":"45","xplore-issue":"6873368","articleId":"6762917","onlineDate":"11 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6762920,"authors":[{"name":"Lin Gu","affiliation":["University of Aizu, Fukushima, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6245516/6939750/6762920/gu-2310456-small.gif","p":["Lin Gu received the M.S. degree in computer science from the University of Aizu, Fukushima, Japan, in 2011, where she is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree.

Therefore, cost minimization has become an emergent issue for the upcoming big data era. Different from conventional cloud services, one of the main features of big data services is the tight coupling between data and computation as computation tasks can be conducted only when the corresponding data are available. As a result, three factors, i.e., task assignment, data placement, and data movement, deeply influence the operational expenditure of data centers. In this paper, we are motivated to study the cost minimization problem via a joint optimization of these three factors for big data services in geo-distributed data centers. To describe the task completion time with the consideration of both data transmission and computation, we propose a 2-D Markov chain and derive the average task completion time in closed-form. Furthermore, we model the problem as a mixed-integer nonlinear programming and propose an efficient solution to linearize it. The high efficiency of our proposal is validated by extensive simulation-based studies.","doi":"10.1109/TETC.2014.2310456","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6939750","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TETC.2014.2310456","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Emerging Topics in Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Emerging Topics in Computing","pdfPath":"/iel7/6245516/6939750/06762920.pdf","startPage":"314","endPage":"323","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cost Minimization for Big Data Processing in Geo-Distributed Data Centers","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 March 2014","displayDocTitle":"Cost Minimization for Big Data Processing in Geo-Distributed Data Centers","volume":"2","issue":"3","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2014","dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2014","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6762920/","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","accessionNumber":"14700018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6762920/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Cost Minimization for Big Data Processing in Geo-Distributed Data Centers","sourcePdf":"tetc-guo-2310456-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.091253S","chronDate":"Sept.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"6245516","isNumber":"6939750","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6245516","citationCount":"69","xplore-issue":"6939750","articleId":"6762920","onlineDate":"11 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6762926,"authors":[{"name":"Zhanyang Ren","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Networking and Switching Technology, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/6832681/6762926/ren-2311235-small.gif","p":["\nZhanyang Ren received the B.E. and Ph.D. degrees from Beijing University\nof Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China, in 2008 and 2013, respectively.","He then joined the Wireless Network Research Department, Huawei Technologies Company Ltd., Beijing, China.

In the meantime, energy efficiency (EE) has now become a critical metric for green system design. In this paper, energy-efficient and fair resource allocation is investigated in a downlink OFDM-based mobile communication system. Given a subcarrier assignment, the bisection-based optimal power allocation (BOPA) is proposed at first, which achieves the maximum EE and guarantees proportional data rates for users. Then, a two-step subcarrier assignment is designed to avoid unaffordable computational complexity of exhaustive search. In the first step, the estimated energy-efficient transmit power is found via the assumptions on flat fading and subcarrier sharing. In the second step, the traditional spectral-efficient subcarrier assignment (SESA) is introduced to complete the bandwidth resource allocation among users. Although the two-step subcarrier assignment is suboptimal due to the fact that the optimization is done independently in two separate steps, numerical results demonstrate that its performance is very close to the optimum. This paper also studies the difference between the energy-efficient solution and the traditional spectral-efficient policy and observes that they are similar with each other in the low channel-gain-to-noise ratio (CNR) regime. This observation is helpful and could enable that the energy-efficient design can be turned into the relatively simpler spectral-efficient policy when the CNR is low.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2014.2311235","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/6832681/06762926.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2014.2311235","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6832681","startPage":"2139","endPage":"2150","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy-Efficient Resource Allocation in Downlink OFDM Wireless Systems With Proportional Rate Constraints","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6762926","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Energy-Efficient Resource Allocation in Downlink OFDM Wireless Systems With Proportional Rate Constraints","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6762926/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 March 2014","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"63","issue":"5","publicationDate":"Jun 2014","accessionNumber":"14379479","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6762926/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Major National Science and Technology Special Project","grantNumber":"2013ZX03001025-001"},{"fundingName":"National High-Technology Program (863 Program) of China","grantNumber":"2014AA01A701"},{"fundingName":"China Next Generation Internet Project","grantNumber":"CNGI-12-03-003"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy-Efficient Resource Allocation in Downlink OFDM Wireless Systems With Proportional Rate Constraints","sourcePdf":"tvt-ren-2311235-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.086556S","chronDate":"Jun  2014","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"6832681","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"59","xplore-issue":"6832681","articleId":"6762926","onlineDate":"11 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6762929,"authors":[{"name":"Zhen Cui","affiliation":["College of Computer Science and Technology, Huaqiao University, Xiamen, China","Key Laboratory of Intelligent Information Processing, Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6221036/6936410/6762929/cui-2305701-small.gif","p":["Zhen Cui (S'13) received the B.S. degree from Shandong Normal University, Jinan, China, in 2004, and then the M.S. degree from Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China, 2006, and is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree with the Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China.","He is currently a Lecturer with Huaqiao University, Xiamen, China.

In this paper, we propose a new unsupervised domain adaptation method called domain adaptation by shifting covariance (DASC) for object recognition without requiring any labeled samples from the target domain. By characterizing samples from each domain as one covariance matrix, the source and target domain are represented into two distinct points residing on a Riemannian manifold. Along the geodesic constructed from the two points, we then interpolate some intermediate points (i.e., covariance matrices), which are used to bridge the two domains. By utilizing the principal components of each covariance matrix, samples from each domain are further projected into intermediate feature spaces, which finally leads to domain-invariant features after the concatenation of these features from intermediate points. In the multiple source domain adaptation task, we also need to effectively integrate different types of features between each pair of source and target domains. We additionally propose an SVM based method to simultaneously learn the optimal target classifier as well as the optimal weights for different source domains. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method for both single source and multiple source domain adaptation tasks.","doi":"10.1109/TCYB.2014.2305701","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel7/6221036/6936410/06762929.pdf","startPage":"2264","endPage":"2273","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCYB.2014.2305701","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6936410","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Flowing on Riemannian Manifold: Domain Adaptation by Shifting Covariance","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6762929","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 March 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6762929/","displayDocTitle":"Flowing on Riemannian Manifold: Domain Adaptation by Shifting Covariance","volume":"44","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 2014","accessionNumber":"14759316","pubMedId":"25415937","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6762929/","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61125106, 61202297 and 61300138"},{"fundingName":"Shaanxi Key Innovation Team of Science and Technology","grantNumber":"2012KCT-04"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003392","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Fujian Province","grantNumber":"2013J01239"},{"fundingName":"Singapore MoE Tier 2 Project","grantNumber":"ARC42/13"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Flowing on Riemannian Manifold: Domain Adaptation by Shifting Covariance","sourcePdf":"tcyb-li-2305701-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.101402S","chronDate":"Dec.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"6221036","isNumber":"6936410","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6221036","citationCount":"33","xplore-issue":"6936410","articleId":"6762929","onlineDate":"11 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6762933,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The coded aperture was implemented using programmable illumination from a commercially available digital light processing projector. At 590 GHz, each of the array element apertures can be optically turned on and off with a modulation depth of 20 dB and a modulation rate of ~ 1.3 kHz. Prototype demonstrations of 4 \u00d74 coded-aperture imaging using Hadamard coding have been performed. Continuous THz imaging with 8 \u00d78 pixels has also been demonstrated, using a slowly moving metal strip as the target. In addition, this technique has been successfully applied to mapping THz beams by using a 6 \u00d76 aperture array at 590 GHz. The imaging results agree closely with theoretical calculations based on Gaussian beam propagation, demonstrating that this technique is promising for realizing real-time and low-cost terahertz cameras for many applications. The reported approach provides a simple but powerful means to visualize THz beams, which is highly desired in quasi-optical system alignment, quantum-cascade laser design and characterization, and THz antenna characterization.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6762933/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 March 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2014","volume":"4","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","accessionNumber":"14267056","publicationDate":"May 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6762933/","isStaticHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Coded-Aperture Imaging Using Photo-Induced Reconfigurable Aperture Arrays for Mapping Terahertz Beams","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"ECCS-1002088, ECCS-1102214 and ECCS-1202452"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Coded-Aperture Imaging Using Photo-Induced Reconfigurable Aperture Arrays for Mapping Terahertz Beams","sourcePdf":"tthz-liu-2307163-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.074862S","chronDate":"May  2014","xplore-pub-id":"5503871","isNumber":"6807840","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5503871","citationCount":"39","xplore-issue":"6807840","articleId":"6762933","onlineDate":"11 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-16"},{"_id":6762934,"authors":[{"name":"Huaguang Zhang","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Synthetical Automation for Process Industries, Northeastern University, Shenyang, Liaoning, China"],"firstName":"Huaguang","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37280792300"},{"name":"Jilie Zhang","affiliation":["College of Information Science and Engineering, Northeastern University, Shenyang, Liaoning, China"],"firstName":"Jilie","lastName":"Zhang","id":"38467147800"},{"name":"Guang-Hong Yang","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Synthetical Automation for Process Industries, Northeastern University, Shenyang, Liaoning, China"],"firstName":"Guang-Hong","lastName":"Yang","id":"37290182400"},{"name":"Yanhong Luo","affiliation":["College of Information Science and Engineering, Northeastern University, Shenyang, Liaoning, China"],"firstName":"Yanhong","lastName":"Luo","id":"37711001500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6706"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0034"}],"articleNumber":"6762934","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":286,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":3382},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computational Intelligence Society","url":"http://ieee-cis.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Equations","Games","Approximation methods","Multi-agent systems","Mathematical model","Dynamic programming","Input variables"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["differential games","dynamic programming","fuzzy set theory","multi-agent systems","optimal control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["leader-based optimal coordination control","consensus problem","multiagent differential games","fuzzy adaptive dynamic programming","online scheme","game theory","generalized fuzzy hyperbolic model","GFHM","coupled Hamilton-Jacobi equations","coupled HJ equations","policy iteration algorithm","local consensus error","local value function","single-network architecture","multiagent systems","approximation solution","stability analysis","weight estimation error","control node trajectory"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Consensus problem","fuzzy adaptive dynamic programming (FADP)","generalized fuzzy hyperbolic model","multiagent differential game","optimal coordination control"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6762934","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/91/7027905/06762934.pdf","startPage":"152","endPage":"163","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TFUZZ.2014.2310238","doi":"10.1109/TFUZZ.2014.2310238","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7027905","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Leader-Based Optimal Coordination Control for the Consensus Problem of Multiagent Differential Games via Fuzzy Adaptive Dynamic Programming","abstract":"In this paper, a new online scheme is presented to design the optimal coordination control for the consensus problem of multiagent differential games by fuzzy adaptive dynamic programming, which brings together game theory, generalized fuzzy hyperbolic model (GFHM), and adaptive dynamic programming.

Namely, for each agent, GFHM is used to capture the mapping between the local consensus error and local value function. Since our scheme uses the single-network architecture for each agent (which eliminates the action network model compared with dual-network architecture), it is a more reasonable architecture for multiagent systems. Furthermore, the approximation solution is utilized to obtain the optimal coordination control. Finally, we give the stability analysis for our scheme, and prove the weight estimation error and the local consensus error are uniformly ultimately bounded. Further, the control node trajectory is proven to be cooperative uniformly ultimately bounded.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6762934/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 March 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2015","volume":"23","issue":"1","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"14915115","dateOfInsertion":"30 January 2015","publicationDate":"Feb. 2015","htmlLink":"/document/6762934/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Leader-Based Optimal Coordination Control for the Consensus Problem of Multiagent Differential Games via Fuzzy Adaptive Dynamic Programming","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61034005, 61273148 and 61203046"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Leader-Based Optimal Coordination Control for the Consensus Problem of Multiagent Differential Games via Fuzzy Adaptive Dynamic Programming","sourcePdf":"tfuzz-zhang-2310238-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.139824S","chronDate":"Feb.  2015","isNumber":"7027905","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"91","citationCount":"286","articleId":"6762934","onlineDate":"11 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-22"},{"_id":6762937,"authors":[{"name":"Thomas Philip Runarsson","affiliation":["School of Engineering and Natural Sciences, University of Iceland, Iceland"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4804728/6895339/6762937/6762937-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Thomas Philip Runarsson (S'98\u2013M'01) received the M.Sc. degree in mechanical engineering and the Dr. Scient.

However, existing reranking algorithms are limited for two main reasons: 1) the textual meta-data associated with images is often mismatched with their actual visual content and 2) the extracted visual features do not accurately describe the semantic similarities between images. Recently, user click information has been used in image reranking, because clicks have been shown to more accurately describe the relevance of retrieved images to search queries. However, a critical problem for click-based methods is the lack of click data, since only a small number of web images have actually been clicked on by users. Therefore, we aim to solve this problem by predicting image clicks. We propose a multimodal hypergraph learning-based sparse coding method for image click prediction, and apply the obtained click data to the reranking of images. We adopt a hypergraph to build a group of manifolds, which explore the complementarity of different features through a group of weights. Unlike a graph that has an edge between two vertices, a hyperedge in a hypergraph connects a set of vertices, and helps preserve the local smoothness of the constructed sparse codes. An alternating optimization procedure is then performed, and the weights of different modalities and the sparse codes are simultaneously obtained. Finally, a voting strategy is used to describe the predicted click as a binary event (click or no click), from the images' corresponding sparse codes. Thorough empirical studies on a large-scale database including nearly 330 K images demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach for click prediction when compared with several other methods. Additional image reranking experiments on real-world data show the use of click prediction is beneficial to improving the performance of prominent graph-based image reranking algorithms.","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2014.2311377","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","startPage":"2019","endPage":"2032","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2014.2311377","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6779706","pdfPath":"/iel7/83/6779706/06762944.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image coding","Image reconstruction","Vectors","Encoding","Visualization","Optimization","Laplace equations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feature extraction","graph theory","image coding","image retrieval","Internet","learning (artificial intelligence)","meta data","optimisation","text analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Web image reranking algorithm","multimodal sparse coding","text-based image search","textual metadata","visual content","visual feature extraction","semantic similarities","click information","search queries","click-based method","click data","multimodal hypergraph learning-based sparse coding method","image click prediction","local smoothness","optimization procedure","voting strategy","binary event","large-scale database"]},{"kwd":["Image reranking","click","manifolds","sparse codes"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Click Prediction for Web Image Reranking Using Multimodal Sparse Coding","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6762944/","volume":"23","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/6762944/","accessionNumber":"14209103","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"pubMedId":"24710402","dateOfInsertion":"01 April 2014","publicationDate":"May 2014","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 March 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2014","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Click Prediction for Web Image Reranking Using Multimodal Sparse Coding","sourcePdf":"tip-tao-2311377-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.086048S","chronDate":"May  2014","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"6779706","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"381","xplore-issue":"6779706","articleId":"6762944","onlineDate":"11 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6762947,"authors":[{"name":"Zhi Liu","affiliation":["Department of Automation, Guangdong University of Technology, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Zhi","lastName":"Liu","id":"37554790500"},{"name":"Fang Wang","affiliation":["Department of Automation, Guangdong University of Technology, Guangzhou, China","College of Mathematics and System Science, Shandong University of Science and Technology, Shandong, China"],"firstName":"Fang","lastName":"Wang","id":"37085501402"},{"name":"Yun Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Automation, Guangdong University of Technology, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Yun","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37279968200"},{"name":"Xin Chen","affiliation":["Department of Mechatronics Engineering, Guangdong University of Technology, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Xin","lastName":"Chen","id":"37291284900"},{"name":"C.

Compared with the conventional deterministic dead-zone models in previous articles, the main advantage of this paper is that the proposed dead-zone model is uncertain and fuzzy. By defuzzifying for fuzzy dead zone ~\u0393(u) and employing an integrated design, an integrated fuzzy controller is constructed. It is proved that, even though the dead-zone input ~\u0393(u) is fuzzy, the integrated fuzzy controller can make the closed-loop system semiglobally uniformly ultimately bounded and the tracking error converge to a small neighborhood of the origin.

For this problem, 1) we propose a metric to quantify the difficulty of the control problem as a function of the required control energy, 2) we derive bounds based on the system dynamics (network topology and weights) to characterize the tradeoff between the control energy and the number of control nodes, and 3) we propose an open-loop control strategy with performance guarantees. In our strategy, we select control nodes by relying on network partitioning, and we design the control input by leveraging optimal and distributed control techniques. Our findings show several control limitations and properties. For instance, for Schur stable and symmetric networks: 1) if the number of control nodes is constant, then the control energy increases exponentially with the number of network nodes; 2) if the number of control nodes is a fixed fraction of the network nodes, then certain networks can be controlled with constant energy independently of the network dimension; and 3) clustered networks may be easier to control because, for sufficiently many control nodes, the control energy depends only on the controllability properties of the clusters and on their coupling strength. We validate our results with examples from power networks, social networks and epidemics spreading.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6762966/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 March 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2014","publicationDate":"March 2014","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6762966/","dateOfInsertion":"09 April 2014","accessionNumber":"14222013","volume":"1","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Controllability Metrics, Limitations and Algorithms for Complex Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Controllability Metrics, Limitations and Algorithms for Complex Networks","sourcePdf":"tcns-pasqualetti-2310254-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.165788S","chronDate":"March  2014","xplore-pub-id":"6509490","isNumber":"6728750","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6509490","citationCount":"328","xplore-issue":"6728750","articleId":"6762966","onlineDate":"11 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6762967,"authors":[{"name":"Seyed Reza Shahamiri","affiliation":["Department of Software Engineering, University of Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7333/6893060/6762967/6762967-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Seyed Reza Shahamiri (M'13) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in computer engineering from Islamic Azad University, Tehran, Iran, in 2004 and 2007, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in computer science from Universiti Teknologi Malaysia, Skudai, Malaysia, in 2011.","He is a Senior Lecturer at the Department of Software Engineering, University of Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.

Although a few attempts have been made to apply ASR technologies to sufferers of dysarthria, previous studies show that such ASR systems have not attained an adequate level of performance. In this study, a dysarthric multi-networks speech recognizer (DM-NSR) model is provided using a realization of multi-views multi-learners approach called multi-nets artificial neural networks, which tolerates variability of dysarthric speech. In particular, the DM-NSR model employs several ANNs (as learners) to approximate the likelihood of ASR vocabulary words and to deal with the complexity of dysarthric speech. The proposed DM-NSR approach was presented as both speaker-dependent and speaker-independent paradigms. In order to highlight the performance of the proposed model over legacy models, multi-views single-learner models of the DM-NSRs were also provided and their efficiencies were compared in detail. Moreover, a comparison among the prominent dysarthric ASR methods and the proposed one is provided. The results show that the DM-NSR recorded improved recognition rate by up to 24.67% and the error rate was reduced by up to 8.63% over the reference model.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6762967/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 March 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2014","dateOfInsertion":"05 September 2014","publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","accessionNumber":"14580113","pubMedId":"24760940","htmlLink":"/document/6762967/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"22","issue":"5","isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A Multi-Views Multi-Learners Approach Towards Dysarthric Speech Recognition Using Multi-Nets Artificial Neural Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Multi-Views Multi-Learners Approach Towards Dysarthric Speech Recognition Using Multi-Nets Artificial Neural Networks","sourcePdf":"tnsre-shahamiri-2309336-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.100703S","chronDate":"Sept.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"7333","isNumber":"6893060","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7333","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"6893060","articleId":"6762967","onlineDate":"11 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-19"},{"_id":6762974,"authors":[{"name":"Joohee Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5503870/6780597/6762974/6762974-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Joohee Kim (S'09) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electrical engineering from the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, Korea, in 2008 and 2010, respectively, where she is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering.","Her current research interests include high-frequency through silicon via (TSV) modeling and TSV failure analysis in TSV-based 3-D ICs.","Ms. Kim was a recipient of the Best Student Paper Award at the 18th IEEE Electrical Performance of Electronic Packaging and Systems conference in 2009."]},"firstName":"Joohee","lastName":"Kim","id":"37600788700"},{"name":"Jonghyun Cho","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5503870/6780597/6762974/6762974-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Jonghyun Cho (S'09) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electrical engineering from the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, Korea, in 2008 and 2010, respectively, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering.","His current research interests include through silicon via (TSV) coupling modeling and noise analysis on analog circuits in TSV-based 3-D ICs."]},"firstName":"Jonghyun","lastName":"Cho","id":"37594787200"},{"name":"Joungho Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5503870/6780597/6762974/6762974-photo-3-source-small.gif","p":["Joungho Kim (M'04) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electrical engineering from Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea, in 1984 and 1986, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, in 1993.","He has research experience in femtosecond time-domain optical measurement technique for high-speed device and circuit testing.

Most of the projections show them as universal memory in the future; however, their evolution is still in a rudimentary stage. Attaining a high density in STT MRAMs is imperative to keep pace with the scaling scenario in field effect transistors (FETs) and hence competitive with future processors. A vertical or a two terminal select device can be a possible solution to achieve the high-density problem. A suitable platform is required for simulating a hybrid magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ)/FET circuit before an actual fabrication is done. However, most simulation tools do not have the capability to model hybrid MTJ/FET devices. Also, the SPICE compatible models for such devices and other novel structures like vertical FET are not available. This paper addresses the above-mentioned concerns and proposes a model for MTJ (coded in C++) and a simulation platform for hybrid MTJ/FET device-circuit co-design with physics-based models. The proposed model is validated using mixed mode simulations.","doi":"10.1109/TMAG.2014.2310181","startPage":"1","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel7/20/6880871/06762989.pdf","endPage":"7","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6880871","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMAG.2014.2310181","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 March 2014","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6762989/","displayDocTitle":"Modeling of In-Plane Magnetic Tunnel Junction for Mixed Mode Simulations","volume":"50","issue":"8","dateOfInsertion":"20 August 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6762989/","isJournal":true,"externalId":"4400307","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"14544311","publicationDate":"Aug. 2014","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modeling of In-Plane Magnetic Tunnel Junction for Mixed Mode Simulations","sourcePdf":"tmag-verma-2310181-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.074347S","chronDate":"Aug.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"20","isNumber":"6880871","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6880871","articleId":"6762989","onlineDate":"11 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6762993,"authors":[{"name":"Pu Wang","affiliation":["Nature Inspired Computation and Applications Laboratory, University of Science and Technology of China (USTC)\u2013Birmingham Joint Research Institute in Intelligent Computation and its Applications, School of Computer Science and Technology, Hefei, Anhui, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4235/7070844/6762993/wang-2305671-small.gif","p":["Pu Wang received the B.Eng. and Ph.D. degrees in computer science from University of Science and Technology of China (USTC), Hefei, China, in 2008 and 2013, respectively.","He is a Research Fellow with the Center for Computational Intelligence, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore.

An important topic in ROC analysis is the ROC convex hull (ROCCH), which is the least convex majorant (LCM) of the empirical ROC curve and covers potential optima for a given set of classifiers. ROCCH maximization problems have been taken as multiobjective optimization problem (MOPs) in some previous work. However, the special characteristics of ROCCH maximization problem makes it different from traditional MOPs. In this paper, the difference will be discussed in detail and a new convex hull-based multiobjective genetic programming (CH-MOGP) is proposed to solve ROCCH maximization problems. Specifically, convex hull-based without redundancy sorting (CWR-sorting) is introduced, which is an indicator-based selection scheme that aims to maximize the area under the convex hull. A novel selection procedure is also proposed based on the proposed sorting scheme. It is hypothesized that by using a tailored indicator-based selection, CH-MOGP becomes more efficient for ROC convex hull approximation than algorithms that compute all Pareto optimal points. Empirical studies are conducted to compare CH-MOGP to both existing machine learning approaches and multiobjective genetic programming (MOGP) methods with classical selection schemes. Experimental results show that CH-MOGP outperforms the other approaches significantly.","doi":"10.1109/TEVC.2014.2305671","startPage":"188","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation","pdfPath":"/iel7/4235/7070844/06762993.pdf","endPage":"200","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7070844","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEVC.2014.2305671","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 March 2014","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6762993/","displayDocTitle":"Convex Hull-Based Multiobjective Genetic Programming for Maximizing Receiver Operating Characteristic Performance","volume":"19","issue":"2","dateOfInsertion":"27 March 2015","htmlLink":"/document/6762993/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15019522","publicationDate":"April 2015","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"973 Program of China","grantNumber":"2011CB707006"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61175065 and 61329302"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004602","fundingName":"Program for New Century Excellent Talents in University","grantNumber":"NCET-12-0512"},{"fundingName":"Science and Technological Fund of Anhui Province for Outstanding Youth","grantNumber":"1108085J16"},{"fundingName":"EPSRC","grantNumber":"EP/J017515/1"},{"fundingName":"European Union Seventh Framework Programme","grantNumber":"247619"},{"fundingName":"Royal Society Wolfson Research Merit Award"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Convex Hull-Based Multiobjective Genetic Programming for Maximizing Receiver Operating Characteristic Performance","sourcePdf":"tevc-tang-2305671-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.093869S","chronDate":"April  2015","xplore-pub-id":"4235","isNumber":"7070844","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4235","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"7070844","articleId":"6762993","onlineDate":"11 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6762995,"authors":[{"name":"Chenguang Yang","affiliation":["School of Computing and Mathematics, Plymouth University, Plymouth, U.K."],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5962385/6924821/6762995/yang-2302475-small.gif","p":["Chenguang Yang (M'10) received the B.Eng. degree in measurement and control from Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an, China, and the Ph.D. degree in control engineering from the National University of Singapore, Singapore, in 2005 and 2010, respectively.","He was with Imperial College London, London, U.K., from 2009 to 2010, as a Research Associate, where he was involved in human\u2013robot interaction.

It is shown that the cut-set upper bound on the capacity can be achieved to within a constant gap, regardless of the actual value of the channel parameters, by either partial-decode-and-forward or compress-and-forward. The performance of these coding strategies is evaluated with both random and deterministic switch at the relay. Numerical evaluations show that the actual gap is less than what analytically obtained, and that random switch achieves higher rates than deterministic switch. As a result of this analysis, the generalized degrees-of-freedom of the G-HD-RC is exactly characterized for this channel. In order to get insights into practical schemes for the G-HD-RC that are less complex than partial-decode-and-forward or compress-and-forward, the exact capacity of the linear deterministic approximation (LDA) of the G-HD-RC at high signal-to-noise-ratio is determined. It is shown that random switch and correlated nonuniform inputs bits are optimal for the LDA. It is then demonstrated that deterministic switch is to within one bit from the capacity. This latter scheme is translated into a coding strategy for the original G-HD-RC and its optimality to within a constant gap is proved. The gap attained by this scheme is larger than that of partial-decode-and-forward, thereby pointing to an interesting practical tradeoff between gap to capacity and complexity.","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2014.2309614","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel7/18/6800061/06763001.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2014.2309614","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6800061","startPage":"2542","endPage":"2562","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Gaussian Half-Duplex Relay Channel","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6763001","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"On the Gaussian Half-Duplex Relay Channel","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6763001/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 March 2014","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"60","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 2014","accessionNumber":"14238999","dateOfInsertion":"17 April 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6763001/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"industrial partners: BMW Group Research & Technology, IABG, Monaco Telecom, Orange, SAP, SFR, ST Microelectronics, Swisscom and Symantec"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Gaussian Half-Duplex Relay Channel","sourcePdf":"tit-cardone-2309614-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.107537S","chronDate":"May  2014","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"6800061","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"6800061","articleId":"6763001","onlineDate":"11 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6763005,"authors":[{"name":"Gautam Mantena","affiliation":["International Institute of Information Technology (IIIT-H), Gachibowli, Hyderabad, India"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6570655/6781022/6763005/6763005-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Gautam Mantena (S\u201913) received the B.Tech. degree from Dhirubhai Ambani Institute of Information and Communication Technology, Gandhinagar, Gujarat, India, in 2006 and the M.S. in IT degree from International Institute of Information Technology, Hyderabad (IIIT-H), India, in 2008.

Current state-of-the-art techniques assume zero prior knowledge about the language of the audio data, and thus explore dynamic time warping (DTW) based techniques for the QbE-STD task. In this paper, we use a variant of DTW based algorithm referred to as non-segmental DTW (NS-DTW), with a computational upper bound of O (mn) and analyze the performance of QbE-STD with Gaussian posteriorgrams obtained from spectral and temporal features of the speech signal. The results show that frequency domain linear prediction cepstral coefficients, which capture the temporal dynamics of the speech signal, can be used as an alternative to traditional spectral parameters such as linear prediction cepstral coefficients, perceptual linear prediction cepstral coefficients and Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients. We also introduce another variant of NS-DTW called fast NS-DTW (FNS-DTW) which uses reduced feature vectors for search. With a reduction factor of \u03b1 \u2208 \u2115, we show that the computational upper bound for FNS-DTW is O(mn/(\u03b1\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n)) which is faster than NS-DTW.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6781022","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TASLP.2014.2311322","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/6570655/6781022/06763005.pdf","startPage":"946","endPage":"955","doi":"10.1109/TASLP.2014.2311322","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Query-by-Example Spoken Term Detection using Frequency Domain Linear Prediction and Non-Segmental Dynamic Time Warping","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2014","displayDocTitle":"Query-by-Example Spoken Term Detection using Frequency Domain Linear Prediction and Non-Segmental Dynamic Time Warping","volume":"22","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/6763005/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 2014","accessionNumber":"14219629","dateOfInsertion":"04 April 2014","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6763005/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 March 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Query-by-Example Spoken Term Detection using Frequency Domain Linear Prediction and Non-Segmental Dynamic Time Warping","sourcePdf":"taslp-prahallad-2311322-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.098702S","chronDate":"May  2014","xplore-pub-id":"6570655","isNumber":"6781022","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6570655","citationCount":"36","xplore-issue":"6781022","articleId":"6763005","onlineDate":"11 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6763007,"authors":[{"name":"Mohammad Ali Maddah-Ali","affiliation":["Bell Labs, Alcatel-Lucent, Holmdel, NJ, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Mohammad Ali Maddah-Ali (S'02\u2013M'08) received the B.Sc. degree from Isfahan University of Technology, Isfahan, Iran, in 1997 and the M.A.Sc. degree from the University of Tehran, Tehran, Iran, in 2000, both in electrical engineering with highest rank in classes.

Conventionally, these memories are used to deliver requested content in part from a locally cached copy rather than through the network. The gain offered by this approach, which we term local caching gain, depends on the local cache size (i.e., the memory available at each individual user). In this paper, we introduce and exploit a second, global, caching gain not utilized by conventional caching schemes. This gain depends on the aggregate global cache size (i.e., the cumulative memory available at all users), even though there is no cooperation among the users. To evaluate and isolate these two gains, we introduce an information-theoretic formulation of the caching problem focusing on its basic structure. For this setting, we propose a novel coded caching scheme that exploits both local and global caching gains, leading to a multiplicative improvement in the peak rate compared with previously known schemes. In particular, the improvement can be on the order of the number of users in the network. In addition, we argue that the performance of the proposed scheme is within a constant factor of the information-theoretic optimum for all values of the problem parameters.","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2014.2306938","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel7/18/6800061/06763007.pdf","startPage":"2856","endPage":"2867","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6800061","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2014.2306938","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fundamental Limits of Caching","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6763007","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2014","displayDocTitle":"Fundamental Limits of Caching","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6763007/","publicationDate":"May 2014","dateOfInsertion":"17 April 2014","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"14251124","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6763007/","volume":"60","issue":"5","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 March 2014","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fundamental Limits of Caching","sourcePdf":"tit-maddahali-2306938-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.072903S","chronDate":"May  2014","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"6800061","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"988","xplore-issue":"6800061","articleId":"6763007","onlineDate":"11 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6763008,"authors":[{"name":"Marc-Andr\u00e9 Joyal","affiliation":["\u00c9cole Polytechnique de Montr\u00e9al, Poly-Grames Research Center, QC, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8/6823189/6763008/6763008-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Marc-Andr\u00e9 Joyal received the B.Eng. and M.A.Sc. degrees in electrical engineering from Universit\u00e9 de Sherbrooke, Sherbrooke, QC, Canada.

However, such a flexible coding unit tree structure also places a great challenge for encoders. In order to fully exploit the coding efficiency brought by this structure, huge amount of computational complexity is needed for an encoder to decide the optimal coding unit tree for each image block. One way to achieve this is to use parallel computing enabled by many-core processors. In this paper, we analyze the challenge to use many-core processors to make coding unit tree decision. Through in-depth understanding of the dependency among different coding units, we propose a parallel framework to decide coding unit trees.

To improve the computation of LSPs, the enhanced Tschirnhaus transform (ETT) is proposed to accelerate the coordinated polynomial solution. The proposed ETT can replace fractional multiplication with addition and shift operations, so unnecessary operations are avoided. To further simplify the hardware of the ETT, three designs are presented: the preprocessing block (PPB), the iterative root-finding block (IRFB), and the closed-form solution block (CFSB). The PPB provides a design with less gate counts that can effectively transform LPCs into general-form polynomials. Such polynomials can be further decomposed into roots using the proposed IRFB based on the Birge-Vieta method. A pipeline-recursive framework is implemented in the IRFB to save calculations. To improve hardware utilization, this paper also analyzes the coefficients relationship of the ETT by introducing the data dependency graph to design the proposed functional blocks in CFSB.

Local gradient-based descriptors, such as SIFT, are encoded via a hierarchical coding scheme composed of spatial aggregating restricted Boltzmann machines (RBM). For each coding layer, we regularize the RBM by encouraging representations to fit both sparse and selective distributions. Supervised fine-tuning is used to enhance the quality of the visual representation for the categorization task. We performed a thorough experimental evaluation using three image categorization data sets. The hierarchical coding scheme achieved competitive categorization accuracies of 79.7% and 86.4% on the Caltech-101 and 15-Scenes data sets, respectively. The visual representations learned are compact and the model's inference is fast, as compared with sparse coding methods. The low-level representations of descriptors that were learned using this method result in generic features that we empirically found to be transferrable between different image data sets. Further analysis reveal the significance of supervised fine-tuning when the architecture has two layers of representations as opposed to a single layer.","doi":"10.1109/TNNLS.2014.2307532","pdfPath":"/iel7/5962385/6960135/06763041.pdf","startPage":"2212","endPage":"2225","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNNLS.2014.2307532","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6960135","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Learning Deep Hierarchical Visual Feature Coding","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6763041/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 March 2014","displayDocTitle":"Learning Deep Hierarchical Visual Feature Coding","volume":"25","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","accessionNumber":"14759099","pubMedId":"25420244","publicationDate":"Dec. 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6763041/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"French Embassy in Singapore through the Merlion Project and Ph.D. Program"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Learning Deep Hierarchical Visual Feature Coding","sourcePdf":"tnnls-goh-2307532-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.136568S","chronDate":"Dec.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"5962385","isNumber":"6960135","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5962385","citationCount":"72","xplore-issue":"6960135","articleId":"6763041","onlineDate":"11 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-10"},{"_id":6763046,"authors":[{"name":"Gan Zheng","affiliation":["Computer Science and Electronic Engineering, University of Essex, Colchester, UK"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/6782402/6763046/6763046-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Gan Zheng (S'05\u2013M'09\u2013SM'12) received the B.

The key idea is that the secondary system helps to boost the primary system's performance by relaying, and, in return, the primary system provides more opportunities for the secondary system to access the spectrum. In contrast to most of existing works that only consider information cooperation, this paper studies joint information and energy cooperation between the two systems, i.e., the primary transmitter sends information for relaying and feeds the secondary system with energy as well. This is particularly useful when the secondary transmitter has good channel quality to the primary receiver but is energy constrained. We propose and study three schemes that enable this cooperation. First, we assume there exists an ideal backhaul between the two systems for information and energy transfer. We then consider two wireless information and energy transfer schemes from the primary transmitter to the secondary transmitter using power splitting and time splitting energy harvesting techniques, respectively. For each scheme, the optimal and zero-forcing solutions are derived. Simulation results demonstrate promising performance gain for both systems due to the additional energy cooperation. It is also revealed that the power splitting scheme can achieve larger rate region than the time splitting scheme when the efficiency of the energy transfer is sufficiently large.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6763046/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 March 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"May1,  2014","volume":"62","issue":"9","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"14219739","dateOfInsertion":"07 April 2014","publicationDate":"May1, 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6763046/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Information and Energy Cooperation in Cognitive Radio Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Information and Energy Cooperation in Cognitive Radio Networks","sourcePdf":"tsp-zheng-2310433-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.099577S","chronDate":"May1,  2014","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"6782402","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"149","xplore-issue":"6782402","articleId":"6763046","onlineDate":"11 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6763050,"authors":[{"name":"M.

In a weak distribution grid with a high PV penetration, this can create significant voltage fluctuations. Energy storage devices are used to smooth out the fluctuation using traditional moving average control. However, moving average does not control the ramp-rate directly; rather the ramp-rate depends on previous values of PV output. This paper proposes a strategy where the ramp-rate of PV panel output is used to control the PV inverter ramp-rate to a desired level by deploying energy storage (which can be available for other purposes, such as storing surplus power, countering voltage rise, etc.). During the ramping event, the desired ramp-rate is governed by controlling the energy storage based on an inverse relationship with the PV panel output ramp-rate to improve the fluctuation mitigation performance. In contrast to the moving average method, the proposed strategy is able to control the desired ramp-rate independent of the past history of the PV panel output. A dynamic model of the PV-storage integrated system is developed to verify the proposed strategy in the presence of physical device time lags. The proposed strategy is verified using simulation results based on an Australian distribution system. A laboratory experiment is also conducted to validate the concept of the proposed control strategy.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Inverters","System-on-chip","Partial discharges","Smoothing methods","Batteries","Performance evaluation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy storage","fluctuations","invertors","photovoltaic power systems","power grids","solar cells"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["solar PV panel","output fluctuations mitigation","cloud passing","solar irradiance variability","distribution grid","energy storage devices","PV inverter ramp-rate control","energy storage control","moving avrage method","dynamic model","PV-storage integrated system","Australian distribution system","photovoltaic power generation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Energy storage","fluctuation","ramp-rate control","solar PV"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TEC.2014.2304951","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion","pdfPath":"/iel7/60/6815993/06763050.pdf","startPage":"507","endPage":"518","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6815993","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEC.2014.2304951","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Novel Approach for Ramp-Rate Control of Solar PV Using Energy Storage to Mitigate Output Fluctuations Caused by Cloud Passing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6763050","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Geoscience"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Novel Approach for Ramp-Rate Control of Solar PV Using Energy Storage to Mitigate Output Fluctuations Caused by Cloud Passing","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6763050/","volume":"29","issue":"2","publicationDate":"June 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6763050/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"14302027","dateOfInsertion":"16 May 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 March 2014","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel Approach for Ramp-Rate Control of Solar PV Using Energy Storage to Mitigate Output Fluctuations Caused by Cloud Passing","sourcePdf":"tec-alam-2304951-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.068659S","chronDate":"June  2014","xplore-pub-id":"60","isNumber":"6815993","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"60","citationCount":"172","xplore-issue":"6815993","articleId":"6763050","onlineDate":"11 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6763052,"authors":[{"name":"Nuno Antunes","affiliation":["University of Coimbra, Coimbra, Portugal"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4629386/7080963/6763052/6763052-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Nuno Antunes received the PhD degree in Information Science and Technology from the University of Coimbra, Portugal.

Research and practice shows that state-of-the-art tools present low effectiveness both in terms of vulnerability coverage and false positive rates. The main problem is that such tools are typically limited in the detection approaches implemented, and are designed for being applied in very concrete scenarios. Thus, using the wrong tool may lead to the deployment of services with undetected vulnerabilities. This paper proposes a benchmarking approach to assess and compare the effectiveness of vulnerability detection tools in web services environments. This approach was used to define two concrete benchmarks for SQL Injection vulnerability detection tools. The first is based on a predefined set of web services, and the second allows the benchmark user to specify the workload that best portrays the specific characteristics of his environment. The two benchmarks are used to assess and compare several widely used tools, including four penetration testers, three static code analyzers, and one anomaly detector. Results show that the benchmarks accurately portray the effectiveness of vulnerability detection tools (in a relative manner) and suggest that the proposed benchmarking approach can be applied in the field.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Benchmark testing","Web services","Security","Measurement","Computer bugs"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["program diagnostics","security of data","Web services"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["security-critical Web services","vulnerability coverage","false positive rates","benchmarking approach","SQL injection vulnerability detection tools","penetration testers","static code analyzers","anomaly detector"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Benchmarking","vulnerability detection","penetration testing","static analysis","and runtime anomaly detection"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TSC.2014.2310221","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Services Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Services Computing","pdfPath":"/iel7/4629386/7080963/06763052.pdf","startPage":"269","endPage":"283","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7080963","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSC.2014.2310221","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Assessing and Comparing Vulnerability Detection Tools for Web Services: Benchmarking Approach and Examples","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6763052","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Assessing and Comparing Vulnerability Detection Tools for Web Services: Benchmarking Approach and Examples","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6763052/","volume":"8","issue":"2","publicationDate":"March-April 2015","htmlLink":"/document/6763052/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"15036077","dateOfInsertion":"11 April 2019","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"March-April  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 March 2014","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Assessing and Comparing Vulnerability Detection Tools for Web Services: Benchmarking Approach and Examples","sourcePdf":"tsc-antunes-2310221-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073544S","chronDate":"March-April  2015","xplore-pub-id":"4629386","isNumber":"7080963","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4629386","citationCount":"33","xplore-issue":"7080963","articleId":"6763052","onlineDate":"11 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6763058,"authors":[{"name":"Ramy H.

When the source-relay channel is sufficiently stronger than the source-destination and relay-destination channels, it is shown that, with the number of relay transmit antennas appropriately chosen, a Grassmannian decode-and-forward scheme, which is devised herein, achieves the ergodic noncoherent capacity of the relay channel within an approximation gap that goes to zero as the SNR goes to infinity.

The inner current and the submodule capacitor voltages are controlled in the MMC. Meanwhile, the LPA is controlled to define the output voltage. A design methodology and experimental results are included to demonstrate the operation of the ACPS topology.","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2014.2310174","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2014.2310174","startPage":"216","endPage":"226","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/63/6883248/06763059.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6883248","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hybrid AC Power Source Based on Modular Multilevel Converter and Linear Amplifier","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 March 2014","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2015","displayDocTitle":"Hybrid AC Power Source Based on Modular Multilevel Converter and Linear Amplifier","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"26 August 2014","volume":"30","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6763059/","accessionNumber":"14543405","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6763059/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hybrid AC Power Source Based on Modular Multilevel Converter and Linear Amplifier","sourcePdf":"tpel-rech-2310174-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.101474S","chronDate":"Jan.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"6883248","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"6883248","articleId":"6763059","onlineDate":"11 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6763060,"authors":[{"name":"Ahmed Alahmadi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/10206/6776454/6763060/alahm-2310355-small.gif","p":["Ahmed Alahmadi received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from Taibah University, Madina, Saudi Arabia, in 2010.

We propose a reliable AES-assisted DTV scheme, in which an AES-encrypted reference signal is generated at the TV transmitter and used as the sync bits of the DTV data frames. By allowing a shared secret between the transmitter and the receiver, the reference signal can be regenerated at the receiver and used to achieve accurate identification of the authorized primary users. In addition, when combined with the analysis on the autocorrelation of the received signal, the presence of the malicious user can be detected accurately whether or not the primary user is present. We analyze the effectiveness of the proposed approach through both theoretical analysis and simulation examples. It is shown that with the AES-assisted DTV scheme, the primary user, as well as malicious user, can be detected with high accuracy under primary user emulation attacks. It should be emphasized that the proposed scheme requires no changes in hardware or system structure except for a plug-in AES chip. Potentially, it can be applied directly to today's DTV system under primary user emulation attacks for more efficient spectrum sharing.","doi":"10.1109/TIFS.2014.2310355","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security","pdfPath":"/iel7/10206/6776454/06763060.pdf","startPage":"772","endPage":"781","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIFS.2014.2310355","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6776454","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Defense Against Primary User Emulation Attacks in Cognitive Radio Networks Using Advanced Encryption Standard","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6763060","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 March 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6763060/","displayDocTitle":"Defense Against Primary User Emulation Attacks in Cognitive Radio Networks Using Advanced Encryption Standard","volume":"9","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 2014","accessionNumber":"14208880","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6763060/","dateOfInsertion":"04 April 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Defense Against Primary User Emulation Attacks in Cognitive Radio Networks Using Advanced Encryption Standard","sourcePdf":"tifs-alahmadi-2310355-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.10613S","chronDate":"May  2014","xplore-pub-id":"10206","isNumber":"6776454","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10206","citationCount":"65","xplore-issue":"6776454","articleId":"6763060","onlineDate":"11 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6763063,"authors":[{"name":"Ling Shao","affiliation":["College of Electronic and Information Engineering, Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology, Nanjing, China","Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University of Sheffield, Sheffield, U.K."],"firstName":"Ling","lastName":"Shao","id":"38265369400"},{"name":"Di Wu","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University of Sheffield, Sheffield, U.K."],"firstName":"Di","lastName":"Wu","id":"38238378600"},{"name":"Xuelong Li","affiliation":["Center for Optical Imagery Analysis and Learning, State Key Laboratory of Transient Optics and Photonics, Xi'an Institute of Optics and Precision Mechanics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Xuelong","lastName":"Li","id":"37293192200"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2162-237X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2162-2388"}],"articleNumber":"6763063","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":99,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":5896},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Feature extraction","Laplace equations","Training","Error analysis","Noise","Neural networks","Data models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error statistics","learning (artificial intelligence)","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["spectral method","learning deep networks","building intelligent system","high-dimensional sensory data","computer vision-related task","multispectral neural networks","MSNN","multicolumn deep neural network","penultimate hierarchical discriminative manifolds","compact representation","low-dimensional embedding","deep neural networks","multicolumn networks","error rate"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Deep networks","multispectral embedding","representation learning."]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Artificial Intelligence","Databases, Factual","Humans","Neural Networks (Computer)","Pattern Recognition, Visual"]},{"kwd":["Deep networks","multispectral embedding","representation learning"]}],"abstract":"Building intelligent systems that are capable of extracting high-level representations from high-dimensional sensory data lies at the core of solving many computer vision-related tasks.

Rateless AL-FEC (e.g., Raptor code or Luby transform (LT) code) can protect a large data block with an overhead somewhat close to ideal codes. In the meantime, its data processing rates of both encoding and decoding are quite efficient even in software implementations. However, we found that conventional rateless AL-FEC schemes may not be the best candidates when considering streaming over Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access (WiMAX) networks for high-speed rail reception in Taiwan. In this paper, we propose a new ideal AL-FEC scheme based on the Chinese remainder theorem (CRT) to facilitate streaming service delivery for high-speed rail reception. The proposed scheme can support the rateless property, but it requires less transmission overhead than conventional rateless codes. Although it requires higher computational cost than conventional rateless codes, the cost is affordable for commodity laptops. In addition to measuring the FEC computation, storage, and decoder overhead, we also evaluate its performance in an emulation environment for simulating high-speed rail reception over WiMAX networks. The emulation result shows that the proposed scheme can achieve the same error protection as Raptor codes, but it requires less transmission overhead, which is suitable for protecting data transmission over bandwidth-limited high-mobility erasure channels.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/6923505/06763072.pdf","startPage":"3517","endPage":"3529","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Ideal Forward Error Correction Codes for High-Speed Rail Multimedia Communications","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2014.2310897","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6923505","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2014.2310897","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6763072","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6763072/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 March 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2014","displayDocTitle":"Ideal Forward Error Correction Codes for High-Speed Rail Multimedia Communications","dateOfInsertion":"14 October 2014","publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","accessionNumber":"14665020","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"63","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/6763072/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ideal Forward Error Correction Codes for High-Speed Rail Multimedia Communications","sourcePdf":"tvt-chiao-2310897-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.12721S","chronDate":"Oct.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"6923505","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6923505","articleId":"6763072","onlineDate":"11 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6763073,"authors":[{"name":"Dileep Kalathil","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Dileep","lastName":"Kalathil","id":"37392116100"},{"name":"Naumaan Nayyar","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Naumaan","lastName":"Nayyar","id":"38234341300"},{"name":"Rahul Jain","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Rahul","lastName":"Jain","id":"37279812200"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9448"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9654"}],"articleNumber":"6763073","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":77,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1481},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Information Theory Society","url":"http://www.itsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Indexes","Markov processes","Algorithm design and analysis","Resource management","Equations","Cognitive radio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","distributed algorithms","learning (artificial intelligence)","Markov processes","matrix algebra"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["player-dependent reward","heterogeneous player","distributed learning algorithm","wireless channel","cognitive radio network","multiple secondary user","opportunistic spectrum access","dUCB4 algorithm","online index-based distributed learning policy","stationary distribution","probability transition matrix","reversible Markov chain","i.i.d. reward model","Markovian reward model","independent identically distributed reward model","MAB model","multiarmed bandit model","distributed online learning","multiplayer multiarmed bandit","decentralized learning"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Distributed adaptive control","multi-armed bandit","online learning","multi-agent systems"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6763073","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2014.2302471","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","abstract":"We consider the problem of distributed online learning with multiple players in multiarmed bandit (MAB) models. Each player can pick among multiple arms. When a player picks an arm, it gets a reward. We consider both independent identically distributed (i.i.d.) reward model and Markovian reward model. In the i.i.d. model, each arm is modeled as an i.i.d. process with an unknown distribution with an unknown mean. In the Markovian model, each arm is modeled as a finite, irreducible, aperiodic and reversible Markov chain with an unknown probability transition matrix and stationary distribution. The arms give different rewards to different players. If two players pick the same arm, there is a collision, and neither of them get any reward. There is no dedicated control channel for coordination or communication among the players. Any other communication between the users is costly and will add to the regret. We propose an online index-based distributed learning policy called dUCB4 algorithm that trades off exploration versus exploitation in the right way, and achieves expected regret that grows at most as near- O(log\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\nT).

A cost-constrained random-coding ensemble with multiple auxiliary costs is introduced, and is shown to achieve error exponents and second-order coding rates matching those of constant-composition random coding, while being directly applicable to channels with infinite or continuous alphabets. The number of auxiliary costs required to match the error exponents and second-order rates of constant-composition coding is studied, and is shown to be at most two. For independent identically distributed random coding, asymptotic estimates of two well-known non-asymptotic bounds are given using saddlepoint approximations. Each expression is shown to characterize the asymptotic behavior of the corresponding random-coding bound at both fixed and varying rates, thus unifying the regimes characterized by error exponents, second-order rates, and moderate deviations. For fixed rates, novel exact asymptotics expressions are obtained to within a multiplicative 1+o(1) term. Using numerical examples, it is shown that the saddlepoint approximations are highly accurate even at short block lengths.","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2014.2310453","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel7/18/6800061/06763080.pdf","startPage":"2647","endPage":"2666","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2014.2310453","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6800061","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Mismatched Decoding: Error Exponents, Second-Order Rates and Saddlepoint Approximations","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6763080","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 March 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6763080/","displayDocTitle":"Mismatched Decoding: Error Exponents, Second-Order Rates and Saddlepoint Approximations","volume":"60","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 2014","accessionNumber":"14239005","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6763080/","dateOfInsertion":"18 April 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mismatched Decoding: Error Exponents, Second-Order Rates and Saddlepoint Approximations","sourcePdf":"tit-scarlett-2310453-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.130589S","chronDate":"May  2014","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"6800061","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"63","xplore-issue":"6800061","articleId":"6763080","onlineDate":"11 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6763085,"authors":[{"name":"Chung-Hsien Wu","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan, R.O.C"],"firstName":"Chung-Hsien","lastName":"Wu","id":"37276427900"},{"name":"Han-Ping Shen","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan, R.O.C"],"firstName":"Han-Ping","lastName":"Shen","id":"37598373300"},{"name":"Yan-Ting Yang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan, R.O.C"],"firstName":"Yan-Ting","lastName":"Yang","id":"38240563500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2329-9290"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2329-9304"}],"articleNumber":"6763085","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":446},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Acoustics","Hidden Markov models","Feature extraction","Speech","Training","Speech processing","IEEE transactions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational linguistics","feature extraction","Gaussian processes","hidden Markov models","mixture models","natural language processing","neural nets","pattern clustering","smart phones","speech recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Chinese-English phone set construction","code switching ASR","DNN extracted articulatory feature extraction","data driven approach","automatic speech recognition","context dependent cross-lingual articulatory feature","distance estimation","training corpus","acoustic feature extraction","acoustic triphone HMM","AF-based GMM","deep neural network","code switching articulation modeling","data sparseness problem","intrasentential code switching","hierarchical triphone clustering algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Articulatory features","code-switching","phone set construction","speech recognition"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6763085","abstract":"This study proposes a data-driven approach to phone set construction for code-switching automatic speech recognition (ASR).

Furthermore, the articulatory features of the \u201clast/first\u201d state of the corresponding preceding/succeeding triphone in the training corpus are used to construct an AF-based GMM. The AFs, extracted using a deep neural network (DNN), are used for code-switching articulation modeling to alleviate the data sparseness problem due to the diverse context-dependent phone combinations in intra-sentential code-switching. The triphones are then clustered to obtain a Chinese-English phone set based on the acoustic HMMs and the AF-based GMMs using a hierarchical triphone clustering algorithm. Experimental results on code-switching ASR show that the proposed method for phone set construction outperformed other traditional methods.","doi":"10.1109/TASLP.2014.2310353","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/6570655/6744692/06763085.pdf","startPage":"858","endPage":"862","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6744692","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TASLP.2014.2310353","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Chinese-English Phone Set Construction for Code-Switching ASR Using Acoustic and DNN-Extracted Articulatory Features","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 March 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6763085/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2014","displayDocTitle":"Chinese-English Phone Set Construction for Code-Switching ASR Using Acoustic and DNN-Extracted Articulatory Features","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6763085/","dateOfInsertion":"19 March 2014","publicationDate":"April 2014","accessionNumber":"14178636","isJournal":true,"volume":"22","issue":"4","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Chinese-English Phone Set Construction for Code-Switching ASR Using Acoustic and DNN-Extracted Articulatory Features","sourcePdf":"taslp-wu-2310353-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.058158S","chronDate":"April  2014","xplore-pub-id":"6570655","isNumber":"6744692","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6570655","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6744692","articleId":"6763085","onlineDate":"11 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6763087,"authors":[{"name":"Marco Lanuzza","affiliation":["Department of Informatics, Modeling, Electronics and System Engineering, University of Calabria, Calabria, Italy"],"firstName":"Marco","lastName":"Lanuzza","id":"37282897600"},{"name":"Pasquale Corsonello","affiliation":["Department of Informatics, Modeling, Electronics and System Engineering, University of Calabria, Calabria, Italy"],"firstName":"Pasquale","lastName":"Corsonello","id":"37283399400"},{"name":"Stefania Perri","affiliation":["Department of Informatics, Modeling, Electronics and System Engineering, University of Calabria, Calabria, Italy"],"firstName":"Stefania","lastName":"Perri","id":"37283398500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-8210"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9999"}],"articleNumber":"6763087","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":48,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1763},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Solid-State Circuits Society","url":"http://www.sscs.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Delays","CMOS integrated circuits","Power supplies","Threshold voltage","Very large scale integration","MOSFET"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS integrated circuits","integrated circuit layout","low-power electronics","phase shifters","system-on-chip"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fast range voltage conversion","wide range voltage conversion","multisupply voltage designs","system-on-chips","level shifters","multithreshold CMOS technique","robust voltage shifting","deep subthreshold","low energy consumption","post layout simulation","propagation delay","static power dissipation","size 90 nm","voltage 100 mV","voltage 1 V","time 16.6 ns","power 8.7 nW","voltage 0.2 V","frequency 1 MHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Level shifter (LS)","multisupply voltage design (MSVD)","subthreshold operation","ultralow power."]},{"kwd":["Level shifter (LS)","multisupply voltage design (MSVD)","subthreshold operation","ultralow power"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6763087","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/92/7027264/06763087.pdf","startPage":"388","endPage":"391","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVLSI.2014.2308400","doi":"10.1109/TVLSI.2014.2308400","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7027264","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fast and Wide Range Voltage Conversion in Multisupply Voltage Designs","abstract":"Multisupply voltage design technique is widely used in modern system-on-chips to tradeoff energy and speed.

We express the single-input multiple-output (SIMO) observation model in the short-time-Fourier-transform (STFT) domain and employ a variational formulation to obtain iterative closed-form learning rules for inferring approximate posteriors on the steering vector and the target signal. By varying the a priori belief in the top-level statistical model, i.e., modeling a quantity as a random process or an unknown deterministic entity, it is shown that the considered framework yields a variety of beamforming algorithms including the celebrated minimum variance distortionless response (MVDR) beamformer. We highlight these interconnections and show by means of simulation results that the Bayesian approach alleviates signal distortion in noisy and uncertain environments as compared to the conventional MVDR beamformer by adaptively learning and incorporating uncertainty pertaining to the steering vector.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"May1,  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6763092/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 March 2014","volume":"62","issue":"9","accessionNumber":"14219748","publicationDate":"May1, 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6763092/","dateOfInsertion":"08 April 2014","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A Bayesian Framework for Blind Adaptive Beamforming","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Bayesian Framework for Blind Adaptive Beamforming","sourcePdf":"tsp-malik-2310432-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.142851S","chronDate":"May1,  2014","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"6782402","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"6782402","articleId":"6763092","onlineDate":"11 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6763095,"authors":[{"name":"Hyun Yang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, Sejong University, Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Hyun","lastName":"Yang","id":"37694109200"},{"name":"Won-Jae Shin","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, Sejong University, Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Won-Jae","lastName":"Shin","id":"37692970300"},{"name":"Seongjoo Lee","affiliation":["Department of Information and Communication Engineering, Sejong University, Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Seongjoo","lastName":"Lee","id":"37085547066"},{"name":"Young-Hwan You","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, Sejong University, Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Young-Hwan","lastName":"You","id":"37085558188"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9545"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1939-9359"}],"articleNumber":"6763095","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":744},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Vehicular Technology Society","url":"http://www.vtsociety.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Estimation","Frequency estimation","Robustness","Frequency conversion","Correlation","Signal to noise ratio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frequency estimation","OFDM modulation","phase estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["residual carrier frequency offset estimation","OFDM system","orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing system","in-phase-quadrature imbalance","I-Q imbalance","CFO estimation scheme"]},{"kwd":["Carrier frequency offset (CFO)","in-phase/quadrature (I/Q) imbalance","orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM)","synchronization"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we focus on improving the accuracy of frequency offset estimation for an orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) system under the conditions of the joint impairments in both carrier frequency offset (CFO) and in-phase/quadrature (I/Q) imbalance.

In some cases, the reliability of those systems is critical, and fault tolerant filter implementations are needed. Over the years, many techniques that exploit the filters' structure and properties to achieve fault tolerance have been proposed. As technology scales, it enables more complex systems that incorporate many filters. In those complex systems, it is common that some of the filters operate in parallel, for example, by applying the same filter to different input signals. Recently, a simple technique that exploits the presence of parallel filters to achieve fault tolerance has been presented. In this brief, that idea is generalized to show that parallel filters can be protected using error correction codes (ECCs) in which each filter is the equivalent of a bit in a traditional ECC. This new scheme allows more efficient protection when the number of parallel filters is large. The technique is evaluated using a case study of parallel finite impulse response filters showing the effectiveness in terms of protection and implementation cost.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6763110/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 March 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","publicationDate":"Feb. 2015","accessionNumber":"14915131","htmlLink":"/document/6763110/","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"29 January 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"23","issue":"2","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Fault Tolerant Parallel Filters Based on Error Correction Codes","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"China's 863 Plan Program Research on the Key Technology for the Base Band Signal Processing for Onboard Payload"},{"fundingName":"Sino-Japan Joint Fund Key Technique Research for GSS Integrated Mobile Satellite Communications"},{"fundingName":"Tsinghua University Initiative Scientific Research Program","grantNumber":"2010THZ03"},{"fundingName":"National Basic Research Program of China","grantNumber":"2012CB316000"},{"fundingName":"Spanish Ministry of Science and Education","grantNumber":"AYA2009-13300-C03"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fault Tolerant Parallel Filters Based on Error Correction Codes","sourcePdf":"tvlsi-reviriego-2308322-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.053517S","chronDate":"Feb.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"7027264","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"7027264","articleId":"6763110","onlineDate":"11 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6763119,"authors":[{"name":"Sachitha Kusaladharma","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada"],"firstName":"Sachitha","lastName":"Kusaladharma","id":"38526153200"},{"name":"Chintha Tellambura","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada"],"firstName":"Chintha","lastName":"Tellambura","id":"37281000600"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"6763119","dbTime":"26 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":271},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference","Rayleigh channels","Shadow mapping","Aggregates","Accuracy","Mathematical model"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","probability","radiofrequency interference","Rayleigh channels","stochastic processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiple-ring model","cognitive radio aggregate interference analysis","Poisson field","cognitive radio transmitters","Rayleigh fading channel","composite Rayleigh fading channel","Gamma shadowing environments","moment generating function","outage asymptotic analysis","guard distances","path loss exponents","outage probability"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cognitive radio","aggregate interference","outage probability","shadowing"]}],"abstract":"This paper proposes a new, flexible, multiple ring model for the aggregate interference analysis of a Poisson field of cognitive radio transmitters distributed over an annular region.

The emerging coding techniques for storage such as fractional repetition codes, provide the required redundancy more efficiently than the conventional replication scheme. In this letter, we extend the construction of fractional repetition codes and present a new coding scheme, termed general fractional repetition codes. The proposed codes can be applied to storage systems in which the storage capacities of nodes may be different. Based on a combinatorial structure known as group divisible design, the new code construction is available for a large set of parameters. The performance of the proposed codes is evaluated by a metric called node repair alternativity, which measures the number of different subsets of nodes that enable the repair of a specific failed node.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"General Fractional Repetition Codes for Distributed Storage Systems","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","doi":"10.1109/LCOMM.2014.030114.132694","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/4234/6798887/06763122.pdf","startPage":"660","endPage":"663","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCOMM.2014.030114.132694","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6798887","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6763122","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6763122/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 March 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2014","displayDocTitle":"General Fractional Repetition Codes for Distributed Storage Systems","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"18","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/6763122/","dateOfInsertion":"16 April 2014","publicationDate":"April 2014","accessionNumber":"14239280","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"General Fractional Repetition Codes for Distributed Storage Systems","sourcePdf":"660-cl1404-zhu.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.052941S","chronDate":"April  2014","xplore-pub-id":"4234","isNumber":"6798887","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4234","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"6798887","articleId":"6763122","onlineDate":"11 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6763123,"authors":[{"name":"Huihui Wu","affiliation":["Department of Communication Engineering, Xiamen University, Xiamen, P.

The relationship between bandwidth blocking ratio (BBR) and fiber type, span length, dispersion management, FEC and intra-channel nonlinearity compensation are evaluated through cross-layer network simulations, which integrate closed-form expressions of quality of transmission into routing, modulation level and spectrum allocation (RMSA). An adaptive FEC assisted RMSA is proposed and proved to improve the network performance by optimizing the FEC overhead assignment for individual paths. Numerical simulations also show considerable performance improvement by deploying shorter span-length fiber links without dispersion management, and imperceptible influence of intra-channel nonlinearity compensation for flexible grid networks under very heavy traffic.

As a consequence, the radiofrequency (RF) spectrum is becoming a very valuable but scarce natural resource. In relation to this, it is well known that some portions of the RF spectrum, such as those assigned to military and emergency services, remain underutilized. These spectral holes, usually referred as \"white spaces,\" then become excellent opportunities for new wireless communications and radar systems to operate. Nevertheless, the necessary dynamic access to properly exploit these free spectral holes can only be performed through very sophisticated and reliable receiver architectures. They must be capable of sensing very broad spectrum ranges while assuring a minimum quality for the received signals.

There are two important factors associated with spectrum sensing: detection probability and false alarm probability. The higher the detection probability, the better the primary users are protected. On the other hand, for cognitive radios the lower the false alarm probability, the more transmission opportunities. However, current radio frequency front-ends cannot perform sensing and transmission simultaneously, which means to spend more time for an accurate sensing will decrease the transmission time. Furthermore, due to the activity of primary users may changes during the cognitive transmission period time, increase the transmission period will increase the risk of interfering to primary users. In this paper, the relationship among cognitive sensing period, transmission period and primary activity is analyzed. Specially, we formulate a mathematical model to obtain the optimal sensing time and transmission time with a constraint of interference to primary users.

Although the more nodes are selected the better beampattern can be formed, it also means more energy will be consumed. Considering the scarcity of energy in wireless ad-hoc network, the number of collaborative nodes must be controlled. It is necessary to select some of them to form the pattern on condition that the SNR requirement in the destination is satisfied. On the other hand, different node topology will lead to different beampattern, it is interesting to find out which nodes can form a better beampattern. In this paper, a new sector-based node selection approach for collaborative beamforming is presented. It is shown that for a uniformly distributed WSN, when the nodes are selected from a set of sector regions, the resulting beampattern mainlobe is narrower and sidelobe is lower compared to those of the classical CB technique. Furthermore, combining with the ring-based selection approach, the sector-based selection approach will get a much better performance.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCCAS.2013.6765204","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6765171","startPage":"141","endPage":"144","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 International Conference on Communications, Circuits and Systems (ICCCAS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6747110/6765171/06765204.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Collaborative beamforming for wireless sensor networks with sector-based node selection","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6765204/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 Nov. 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6765204/","displayDocTitle":"Collaborative beamforming for wireless sensor networks with sector-based node selection","conferenceDate":"15-17 Nov. 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2013","accessionNumber":"14180285","dateOfInsertion":"13 March 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"1","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Collaborative beamforming for wireless sensor networks with sector-based node selection","confLoc":"Chengdu, China","sourcePdf":"010204141144.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041457S","chronDate":"15-17 Nov. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6747110","isNumber":"6765171","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6747110","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6765171","articleId":"6765204","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-26"},{"_id":6765212,"authors":[{"name":"Jingye Li","affiliation":["The State Key Laboratory of Integrated Services Networks, Xidian University, Xi'an, P.

The first scheme is to maximize the system capacity, and the second one is a multi-objective optimization model for maximizing both the system capacity and the user satisfaction. Both theoretical analysis and simulation results demonstrate that scheme 1 can achieve optimal system capacity, and scheme 2 can obtain sub-optimal system capacity with optimal user satisfaction compared to the conventional algorithm.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6765212/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 Nov. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"1","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"13 March 2014","accessionNumber":"14160609","htmlLink":"/document/6765212/","conferenceDate":"15-17 Nov. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Resource allocation scheme based on weighted power control in cognitive radio systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Resource allocation scheme based on weighted power control in cognitive radio systems","confLoc":"Chengdu, China","sourcePdf":"010301178182.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065143S","chronDate":"15-17 Nov. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6747110","isNumber":"6765171","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6747110","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6765171","articleId":"6765212","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6765213,"authors":[{"name":"Jianyao Zhu","affiliation":["School of Physics and Electronic Engineering, Sichuan Normal University, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Jianyao","lastName":"Zhu","id":"37078302400"},{"name":"Zhaorong Zhou","affiliation":["School of Physics and Electronic Engineering, Sichuan Normal University, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Zhaorong","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37278616300"},{"name":"Chenying Ren","affiliation":["School of Physics and Electronic Engineering, Sichuan Normal University, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Chenying","lastName":"Ren","id":"37086654978"},{"name":"Yide Zhang","affiliation":["National Laboratory of Communications, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Yide","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37086656438"},{"name":"Tao Jiang","affiliation":["School of Physics and Electronic Engineering, Sichuan Normal University, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Tao","lastName":"Jiang","id":"38239417400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-3051-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-3050-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6765213","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":94},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6765213","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resource management","Algorithm design and analysis","Interference","Greedy algorithms","Optimization","Cognitive radio","Immune system"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","computational complexity","frequency division multiple access","greedy algorithms","OFDM modulation","optimisation","radiofrequency interference","resource allocation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio networks","CRN","immune algorithm","orthogonal frequency division multiple access","OFDMA","interference power","cognitive users","primary user","resource allocation problem","NP problem","suboptimal algorithm","sub-carrier allocation","greedy algorithm"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICCCAS.2013.6765213","publicationTitle":"2013 International Conference on Communications, Circuits and Systems (ICCCAS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 International Conference on Communications, Circuits and Systems (ICCCAS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6747110/6765171/06765213.pdf","startPage":"183","endPage":"187","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCCAS.2013.6765213","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6765171","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Resource allocation based on immune algorithm in cognitive radio networks","abstract":"For the resource allocation in orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) based cognitive radio network (CRN), there generally exist various constraints, such as the interference power introduced by cognitive users (CUs) to the primary user (PU) below a specified threshold, transmitted power constraints of CUs and discrete rates on sub-carriers, the corresponding resource allocation problem is an NP problem, thus the computationally efficient optimal algorithm cannot be found and the suboptimal algorithm should be developed. Unlike existing works, we study this kind of resource allocation problems by taking the priority of CUs into account and propose a computationally efficient suboptimal algorithm. The proposed algorithms can be decomposed into two steps: first, implementing sub-carrier allocation based on the immune algorithm; and then applying the greedy algorithm for rate adjustment on sub-carriers.

It is shown that N-continuous SIM-OFDM has considerable sidelobe suppression and relatively low sensitive to error.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"N-continuous subcarrier index modulation OFDM","publicationTitle":"2013 International Conference on Communications, Circuits and Systems (ICCCAS)","doi":"10.1109/ICCCAS.2013.6765277","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 International Conference on Communications, Circuits and Systems (ICCCAS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6747110/6765270/06765277.pdf","startPage":"22","endPage":"25","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCCAS.2013.6765277","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6765270","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6765277","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6765277/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 Nov. 2013","displayDocTitle":"N-continuous subcarrier index modulation OFDM","conferenceDate":"15-17 Nov. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"2","htmlLink":"/document/6765277/","dateOfInsertion":"13 March 2014","publicationDate":"Nov. 2013","accessionNumber":"14160728","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"N-continuous subcarrier index modulation OFDM","confLoc":"Chengdu, China","sourcePdf":"0102062225.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068154S","chronDate":"15-17 Nov. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6747110","isNumber":"6765270","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6747110","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6765270","articleId":"6765277","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6765282,"authors":[{"name":"Tao He","affiliation":["School of Aeronautics and Astronautics, UESTC, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Tao","lastName":"He","id":"38106697800"},{"name":"Huawei Chen","affiliation":["School of Aeronautics and Astronautics, UESTC, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Huawei","lastName":"Chen","id":"38108074800"},{"name":"Qiang Liu","affiliation":["School of Aeronautics and Astronautics, UESTC, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Qiang","lastName":"Liu","id":"37086749702"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-3051-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-3050-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6765282","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":139},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference","Signal to noise ratio","Relays","Jamming","Optimization","Cognitive radio","Security"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","cognitive radio","convex programming","cooperative communication","iterative methods","jamming","quality of service","search problems","telecommunication security"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["QoS-based beamforming","cooperative jamming","cognitive radio networks","physical layer security","quality of service perspective","signal-to-noise","interference limit","optimization objective","convex optimization","iterative search"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"QoS-based beamforming with cooperative jamming in Cognitive Radio Networks","doi":"10.1109/ICCCAS.2013.6765282","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6765270","endPage":"45","publicationTitle":"2013 International Conference on Communications, Circuits and Systems (ICCCAS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 International Conference on Communications, Circuits and Systems (ICCCAS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6747110/6765270/06765282.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCCAS.2013.6765282","startPage":"42","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6765282","abstract":"This paper studies on the issue of physical layer security of Cognitive Radio Network (CRN) with cooperative jamming from the Quality of Service (QoS) perspective.

One of the main problems facing accurate positioning in actual wireless positioning system is non-line-of-sight (NLOS) propagation where the signal arrives at a base station from reflections. Although maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) and minimum mean square error estimator (MMSEE) have been successfully applied in time-difference-of-arrival (TDOA) based localization methods for LOS environments, the problem of mobile location for time-of-arrival (TOA) positioning technique is still an open issue. Moreover, the performance of MLE and MMSEE may be sharply degraded in a real wireless channel due to the large errors of range measurements caused by NLOS propagation. In this paper, effective location algorithms based on NLOS weighting are proposed to mitigate NLOS errors. Main contributions of this paper are listed as follows: (1) both MLE and MMSEE are extended from TDOA to TOA; (2) weight matrix of the proposed method considers the effects of NLOS errors such that NLOS errors can be effectively suppressed. The simulation results show that the proposed method has better positioning accuracy than existing methods.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Maximum likelihood estimation","Measurement uncertainty","Position measurement","Accuracy","Noise measurement","Standards","Noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["direction-of-arrival estimation","least mean squares methods","maximum likelihood estimation","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["time-difference-of-arrival location","TDOA location","NLOS environments","wireless positioning system","nonline-of-sight propagation","NLOS propagation","maximum likelihood estimator","MLE","minimum mean square error estimator","MMSEE","mobile location","time-of-arrival positioning","wireless channel","weight matrix"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6765270","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCCAS.2013.6765283","startPage":"46","endPage":"49","publicationTitle":"2013 International Conference on Communications, Circuits and Systems (ICCCAS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 International Conference on Communications, Circuits and Systems (ICCCAS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6747110/6765270/06765283.pdf","doi":"10.1109/ICCCAS.2013.6765283","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Novel TOA location algorithms based on MLE and MMSEE for NLOS environments","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Novel TOA location algorithms based on MLE and MMSEE for NLOS environments","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"14160649","publicationDate":"Nov. 2013","isConference":true,"volume":"2","conferenceDate":"15-17 Nov. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"13 March 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6765283/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6765283/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 Nov. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Novel TOA location algorithms based on MLE and MMSEE for NLOS environments","confLoc":"Chengdu, China","sourcePdf":"0104024649.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.081973S","chronDate":"15-17 Nov. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6747110","isNumber":"6765270","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6747110","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6765270","articleId":"6765283","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6765302,"authors":[{"name":"Jen-Fa Huang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Jen-Fa","lastName":"Huang","id":"37311438700"},{"name":"Sheng-Hui Meng","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Sheng-Hui","lastName":"Meng","id":"37532490700"},{"name":"Chao-Chin Yang","affiliation":["Department of Electro-Optical Engineering, Kun Shan University, Tainan, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chao-Chin","lastName":"Yang","id":"37291802400"},{"name":"Ying-Chen Lin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Ying-Chen","lastName":"Lin","id":"37085425028"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-3051-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-3050-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6765302","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":87},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Shift registers","Optical switches","Decoding","Security","Codecs","Arrayed waveguide gratings","Encoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["arrayed waveguide gratings","code division multiple access","codecs","optical fibre networks","pseudonoise codes","sequential codes","shift registers","telecommunication network routing","telecommunication security"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cell-shift value","electrical shift register","memory cell state","signature code","M-sequence code","maximal-length sequence code","AWG router","cyclic property","arrayed-waveguide gratings","dynamic reconfigurable codec","pseudo-noise","network security","OCDMA network decoder","OCDMA network coder","spectral-amplitude coding scheme","optical layer security","OCDMA technique","optical code-division multiple-access technique","optical CDMA network access","post-switching coding","waveguide-grating router structuring"]}],"abstract":"Optical code-division multiple-access (OCDMA) technique has been considered as a good candidate to provide optical layer security and regards as an important benefit to the enhanced security. In this paper, an enhanced security mechanism is structured over spectral-amplitude coding (SAC) scheme of OCDMA network coder/decoders (codecs). The network security is obtained through pseudo-noise (PN) type of shift register (SR) state switching to combat with eavesdropping. We construct the dynamic reconfigurable codec over arrayed-waveguide gratings (AWGs) by utilizing the cyclic properties of AWG routers and maximal-length sequence (M-sequence) codes. Signature code unique to each OCDMA network user is reconfigured in accordance with the memory cell state of the controlling electrical shift registers. Examples for both network user and eavesdropper are numerically illustrated. It is shown that, the eavesdroppers cannot accurately detect the cell-shift values of the shift register when the scheme is triggered. The proposed scheme thus makes the probability of achieving a correct detection result for the eavesdroppers become much lower. The degree of OCDMA network confidentiality is hence largely improved.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Structuring waveguide-grating routers with post-switching coding to secure optical CDMA network access","publicationTitle":"2013 International Conference on Communications, Circuits and Systems (ICCCAS)","doi":"10.1109/ICCCAS.2013.6765302","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 International Conference on Communications, Circuits and Systems (ICCCAS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6747110/6765270/06765302.pdf","startPage":"130","endPage":"134","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCCAS.2013.6765302","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6765270","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6765302","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6765302/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 Nov. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Structuring waveguide-grating routers with post-switching coding to secure optical CDMA network access","conferenceDate":"15-17 Nov. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"2","htmlLink":"/document/6765302/","dateOfInsertion":"13 March 2014","publicationDate":"Nov. 2013","accessionNumber":"14180300","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Structuring waveguide-grating routers with post-switching coding to secure optical CDMA network access","confLoc":"Chengdu, China","sourcePdf":"030301130134.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071479S","chronDate":"15-17 Nov. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6747110","isNumber":"6765270","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6747110","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6765270","articleId":"6765302","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6765303,"authors":[{"name":"Chao-Chin Yang","affiliation":["Department of Electro-Optical Engineering, Kun Shan University, Tainan, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chao-Chin","lastName":"Yang","id":"37291802400"},{"name":"Kai-Sheng Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Kai-Sheng","lastName":"Chen","id":"38546729400"},{"name":"Jen-Fa Huang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Jen-Fa","lastName":"Huang","id":"37311438700"},{"name":"Huan-Hao Chang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Huan-Hao","lastName":"Chang","id":"37086715944"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-3051-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-3050-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6765303","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":131},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optical fibers","Optical receivers","Bit error rate","Noise","Optical fiber networks","Binary phase shift keying"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","error statistics","Gaussian processes","phase shift keying","radio-over-fibre"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["BPSK modulated radio transmissions","optical CDMA network","MAI elimination","radio-over-fiber techniques","ROF techniques","spectral amplitude coding optical code division multiple access","SAC-OCDMA","radio frequency","RF modulated signal","spectrum coded optical carriers","bit error rate","BER expression","Gaussian approximation","noise distribution","phase induced intensity noise","PIIN","binary phase shift keying","BPSK signal","SQC code","m-sequence code"]}],"abstract":"We describe the implementation of radio-over-fiber (ROF) techniques with a combination of spectral-amplitude-coding optical code-division-multiple-access (SAC-OCDMA).

In this paper, we propose a new method to deal with the non-cooperative radar pulse train, or in another name, the uniform pulse position modulated (PPM) signal, which is a kind of LPI signal that has been used in many radar systems. Different from the conventional pulse-by-pulse method, we deal with the several pulses in the PPM radar signals at the same time. When the signals are intercepted, we firstly use fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to estimate the carrier frequency and possible limits of the pulse widths (PWs) of the PPM signals. Next, we select a group of PWs to construct two groups of matched filters with different initial phase. Then we filter the PPM radar signals using these filters and search the best one to estimate the pulse width and time of arrivals (TOAs). Although the matched filter we get may be suboptimal, the gain we get in the SNR is enough for us to detect the weak pulses and estimate the parameters.","doi":"10.1109/ICCCAS.2013.6765321","pdfPath":"/iel7/6747110/6765270/06765321.pdf","startPage":"214","endPage":"217","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 International Conference on Communications, Circuits and Systems (ICCCAS)","publicationTitle":"2013 International Conference on Communications, Circuits and Systems (ICCCAS)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCCAS.2013.6765321","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6765270","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Detection and estimation of non-cooperative uniform pulse position modulated radar signals at low SNR","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6765321/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 Nov. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Detection and estimation of non-cooperative uniform pulse position modulated radar signals at low SNR","isConference":true,"volume":"2","dateOfInsertion":"13 March 2014","accessionNumber":"14160648","publicationDate":"Nov. 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6765321/","conferenceDate":"15-17 Nov. 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Detection and estimation of non-cooperative uniform pulse position modulated radar signals at low SNR","confLoc":"Chengdu, China","sourcePdf":"041008214217.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062092S","chronDate":"15-17 Nov. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6747110","isNumber":"6765270","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6747110","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6765270","articleId":"6765321","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6765357,"authors":[{"name":"Pengfei Liao","affiliation":["State key Laboratory of Electronic Thin Films and Integrated Devices, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Pengfei","lastName":"Liao","id":"38552997200"},{"name":"Ping Luo","affiliation":["State Key laboratory of Electronic Thin Films and Integrated Devices, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Ping","lastName":"Luo","id":"37412836900"},{"name":"Weizhong Chen","affiliation":["State Key laboratory of Electronic Thin Films and Integrated Devices, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Weizhong","lastName":"Chen","id":"38189584400"},{"name":"Bo Zhang","affiliation":["State Key laboratory of Electronic Thin Films and Integrated Devices, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Bo","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37279403200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-3051-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-3050-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6765357","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":370},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Capacitors","Capacitance","Simulation","Operational amplifiers","Transfer functions","Topology","Educational institutions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["active networks","amplifiers","capacitors","CMOS analogue integrated circuits","compensation","integrated circuit design","multiplying circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["embedded advanced capacitor multiplier compensation","two-stage amplifier","capacitive load","EACMC","voltage-controlled current source","GBW","standard CMOS process","size 0.13 mum","capacitance 1200 pF","frequency 1.51 MHz","power 154 muW","capacitance 0.85 pF"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6765357","abstract":"An embedded capacitor multiplier compensation (EACMC) for two-stage amplifier with large capacitive loads is presented in this paper with detailed theoretical analysis.

We derive the relation among the Lagrange multiplier, transmitting signal and noise. Since both transmitting signal and noise are unknown, it is impossible to solve the Lagrange multipliers exactly. However, in this paper, an estimation method is proposed to obtain the approximations of the Lagrange multipliers with low computational complexity.

Much efforts have been focused on the development of dictionary learning algorithms so that the sparse representation of signals can be efficiently performed. In this paper, we propose a method for learning a signal dependent overcomplete dictionary. This is accomplished by posing the sparse representation of signals as a problem of matrix factorization with a sparsity constraint. By generalizing the conventional coordinate descent method, we develop a so-called sparse alternating parallel coordinate descent (SAPCD) algorithm, which is structured by iteratively solving the two optimal problems, the learning process of the dictionary and the estimating process of the coefficients for constructing the signals. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed algorithm performs better than the famous K-SVD algorithm and several other algorithms for comparison.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6765490/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 Nov. 2013","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"2-4 Nov. 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6765490/","dateOfInsertion":"13 March 2014","publicationDate":"Nov. 2013","accessionNumber":"14160820","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Sparse representation and dictionary learning based on alternating parallel coordinate descent","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sparse representation and dictionary learning based on alternating parallel coordinate descent","confLoc":"Aizu-Wakamatsu, Japan","sourcePdf":"Paper491.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.091741S","chronDate":"2-4 Nov. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6747515","isNumber":"6765401","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6747515","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6765401","articleId":"6765490","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":6765522,"authors":[{"name":"Fenglin Han","affiliation":["Norway Department of Telematics, Norwegian University of Science and Technology Trondheim"],"firstName":"Fenglin","lastName":"Han","id":"37074504700"},{"name":"Peter Herrmann","affiliation":["Norway Department of Telematics, Norwegian University of Science and Technology Trondheim"],"firstName":"Peter","lastName":"Herrmann","id":"37362021000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2364-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6765522","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":80},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6765522","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Unified modeling language","Real-time systems","Analytical models","Automata","Embedded systems","Stochastic processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automata theory","computational complexity","embedded systems","formal specification","formal verification","scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["real-time system performance modeling","scheduling analysis","embedded real-time system","platform dependency","application dependency","complexity","model-based engineering method","SPACE","verification","real-time properties","reactive systems","performance estimation","schedulability analysis","reactive real-time building blocks","performance profile","real-time task evaluation","real-time interface description","timed automata","hardware policy simulation","scheduling policy simulation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Real-time embedded systems","SPACE","performance evaluation","UML","timed automata"]}],"abstract":"The development and analysis of embedded real-time system is complex due to its platform and application dependencies.

Second, we present the schedulability analysis of a high level real-time system which is carried out by transforming real-time interface descriptions to timed automata that are composed with automata simulating hardware and scheduling policies.","doi":"10.1109/ICAwST.2013.6765522","publicationTitle":"2013 International Joint Conference on Awareness Science and Technology & Ubi-Media Computing (iCAST 2013 & UMEDIA 2013)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 International Joint Conference on Awareness Science and Technology & Ubi-Media Computing (iCAST 2013 & UMEDIA 2013)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6747515/6765401/06765522.pdf","startPage":"663","endPage":"671","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICAwST.2013.6765522","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6765401","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modeling real-time system performance with respect to scheduling analysis","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6765522/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 Nov. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Modeling real-time system performance with respect to scheduling analysis","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2013","accessionNumber":"14160809","htmlLink":"/document/6765522/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"13 March 2014","conferenceDate":"2-4 Nov. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modeling real-time system performance with respect to scheduling analysis","confLoc":"Aizu-Wakamatsu, Japan","sourcePdf":"Paper663.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.098261S","chronDate":"2-4 Nov. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6747515","isNumber":"6765401","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6747515","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6765401","articleId":"6765522","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6765585,"authors":[{"name":"Miho Tsuwaki","affiliation":["Waseda University, Japan"],"firstName":"Miho","lastName":"Tsuwaki","id":"38564012200"},{"name":"Jun Mizuno","affiliation":["Waseda University, Japan"],"firstName":"Jun","lastName":"Mizuno","id":"37297050000"},{"name":"Takashi Kasahara","affiliation":["Waseda University, Japan"],"firstName":"Takashi","lastName":"Kasahara","id":"38235714300"},{"name":"Tomohiko Edura","affiliation":["Kyushu University, Japan"],"firstName":"Tomohiko","lastName":"Edura","id":"37426046600"},{"name":"Eri Kunisawa","affiliation":["Kyushu University, Japan"],"firstName":"Eri","lastName":"Kunisawa","id":"37086782730"},{"name":"Ryoichi Ishimatsu","affiliation":["Kyushu University, Japan"],"firstName":"Ryoichi","lastName":"Ishimatsu","id":"37085436520"},{"name":"Shigeyuki Matsunami","affiliation":["Kyushu University, Japan"],"firstName":"Shigeyuki","lastName":"Matsunami","id":"38234884600"},{"name":"Toshihiko Imato","affiliation":["Kyushu University, Japan"],"firstName":"Toshihiko","lastName":"Imato","id":"37423511500"},{"name":"Chihaya Adachi","affiliation":["Kyushu University, Japan"],"firstName":"Chihaya","lastName":"Adachi","id":"37319518800"},{"name":"Shuichi Shoji","affiliation":["Waseda University, Japan"],"firstName":"Shuichi","lastName":"Shoji","id":"37285724200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-3509-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1084-6999"}],"articleNumber":"6765585","dbTime":"16 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":313},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fluorescence","Microfluidics","Substrates","Cathodes","Anodes","Microchannel","Indium tin oxide"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["chemiluminescence","dyes","electroluminescence","fluorescence","microchannel flow","microfabrication","photolithography"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["microfluidic ECL integrated flow cell","electrochemiluminescence-induced fluorescence chip","microchannel flow","multicolor emitting ECL excitation source","microfabrication","photolithography technique","bonding technique","resorufin solution","fluorescent dye","rubrene solution","multifluorescence detection device","ECL light source","wavelength 600 nm","wavelength 560 nm","voltage 4 V"]}],"abstract":"We propose a portable electrochemiluminescence (ECL)-induced fluorescence chip which consists of flow channels for fluorescence sample and multi-color emitting ECL excitation source.

These capabilities are sought in applications that need tiny but accurate volume of liquid delivery at high flow rate. For this purpose, we mainly focused on geometry of electrodes and developed novel shapes and arrangements of electrodes in electrowetting on dielectric microfluidic device. To dispense liquid droplets in higher volume precision and consistency, a novel reservoir design named TCC reservoir is introduced. To reduce time to dispense a droplet, L-junction is developed.

The sealed ISFET chip is used for measuring the flow rate of non-ionic solutions including acetone, ethanol and glycerol of slow flow rate.

However, when channel state information (CSI) knowledge is limited at the transmitter, the performance of the BD may be degraded because inter-user interference cannot be completely eliminated. In this paper, we propose an efficient CSI quantization technique for BD preceded systems with limited feedback where users supported by a base station are selected by dynamic scheduling. First, we express the received signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) when multiple data streams are transmitted to the user, and derive a lower bound expression of the expected received SINR at each user. Then, based on this measure, each user determines its quantized CSI feedback information which maximizes the derived expected SINR, which comprises both the channel direction and the amplitude information. From simulations, we confirm that the proposed SINR-based channel quantization scheme achieves a significant sum rate gain over the conventional method in practical MU-MIMO systems.","doi":"10.1109/JCN.2014.000003","publicationTitle":"Journal of Communications and Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Communications and Networks","pdfPath":"/iel7/5449605/6765886/06765887.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"9","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JCN.2014.000003","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6765886","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Channel quantization for block diagonalization with limited feedback in multiuser MIMO downlink channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6765887","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"KICS","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 March 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6765887/","displayDocTitle":"Channel quantization for block diagonalization with limited feedback in multiuser MIMO downlink channels","volume":"16","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Feb. 2014","accessionNumber":"14156825","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6765887/","dateOfInsertion":"12 March 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Channel quantization for block diagonalization with limited feedback in multiuser MIMO downlink channels","sourcePdf":"1.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.076433S","chronDate":"Feb.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"5449605","isNumber":"6765886","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5449605","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"6765886","articleId":"6765887","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"KICS","_value":"JCN","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6765888,"authors":[{"name":"Khuong Ho-Van","affiliation":["Department of Telecommunications Engineering, HoChiMinh City University of Technology, Vietnam"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5449605/6765886/6765888/6765888-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Khuong Ho-Van received the B.E.

Novel closed-form expressions are derived and subsequently validated extensively through comparisons with respective results from computer simulations. The proposed expressions are rather long but straightforward to handle both analytically and numerically since they are expressed in terms of well known built-in functions. In addition, the offered results provide the following technical insights: i) Channel information imperfection degrades considerably the performance of both unlicensed network in terms of OP and licensed network in terms of interference levels; ii) underlay cooperative CR networks experience the outage saturation phenomenon; Hi) the probability that the interference power constraint is satisfied is relatively low and depends significantly on the corresponding fading severity conditions as well as the channel estimation quality; iv) there exists a critical performance trade-off between unlicensed and licensed networks.","doi":"10.1109/JCN.2014.000004","publicationTitle":"Journal of Communications and Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Communications and Networks","pdfPath":"/iel7/5449605/6765886/06765888.pdf","startPage":"10","endPage":"17","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JCN.2014.000004","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6765886","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Underlay cooperative cognitive networks with imperfect Nakagami-m fading channel information and strict transmit power constraint: Interference statistics and outage probability analysis","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6765888","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"KICS","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 March 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6765888/","displayDocTitle":"Underlay cooperative cognitive networks with imperfect Nakagami-m fading channel information and strict transmit power constraint: Interference statistics and outage probability analysis","volume":"16","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Feb. 2014","accessionNumber":"14156830","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6765888/","dateOfInsertion":"12 March 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Underlay cooperative cognitive networks with imperfect Nakagami-m fading channel information and strict transmit power constraint: Interference statistics and outage probability analysis","sourcePdf":"10.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.089923S","chronDate":"Feb.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"5449605","isNumber":"6765886","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5449605","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"6765886","articleId":"6765888","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"KICS","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6765889,"authors":[{"name":"Hyun-Ho Lee","affiliation":["Korea University, School of Electrical Engineering, Seoul, Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5449605/6765886/6765889/6765889-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Hyun-Ho Lee received the B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. degrees in Electrical Engineering from Korea University, Seoul, Korea in 2007, 2009, and 2013, respectively.

We present an upper bound on the rate loss of the proposed scheme and derive the scaling law of the feedback load to maintain a constant rate loss relative to IA with perfect channel knowledge. Considering the impact of overhead due to training, cooperation, and feedback, we address the effective degrees of freedom (DOF) of the proposed scheme and derive the maximization of the effective DOF.

In this paper, we develop models for bounding interference levels from secondary network to the primary nodes within a spectrum sensing framework. Instead of classical stochastic approaches where Poisson point processes are used to model transmitters, we consider a more practical model which takes into account the medium access control regulations and where the secondary Poisson process is judiciously thinned in two phases to avoid interference with the secondary as well as the primary nodes. The resulting process will be a modified version of the Mat\u00e9rn point process. For this model, we obtain bounds for the complementary cumulative distribution function of interference and present simulation results which show the developed analytical bounds are quite tight. Moreover, we use these bounds to find the operation regions of the secondary network such that the interference constraint is satisfied on receiving primary nodes. We then obtain theoretical results on the primary and secondary throughputs and find the throughput limits under the interference constraint.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"KICS","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6765894/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 March 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"16","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"12 March 2014","accessionNumber":"14156824","htmlLink":"/document/6765894/","displayDocTitle":"Interference and throughput in spectrum sensing cognitive radio networks using point processes","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Interference and throughput in spectrum sensing cognitive radio networks using point processes","sourcePdf":"67.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.108808S","chronDate":"Feb.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"5449605","isNumber":"6765886","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5449605","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"6765886","articleId":"6765894","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"KICS","_value":"JCN","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6765905,"authors":[{"name":"Jingping Qiao","affiliation":["Shandong University, Jinan, Shandong, CN"],"lastName":"Jingping Qiao","id":"37087674380"},{"name":"Haixia Zhang","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Engineering, Shandong University"],"lastName":"Haixia Zhang","id":"37087220559"},{"name":"Dongfeng Yuan","affiliation":["School of Inf. and Comm., Guilin University of Electronic Technology"],"lastName":"Dongfeng Yuan","id":"37087192172"},{"name":"Feng Zhao","affiliation":["Guilin University of Electronic Technology, Guilin, Guangxi, CN"],"lastName":"Feng Zhao","id":"37087159362"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6050-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-6048-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2163-0771"}],"articleNumber":"6765905","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":171},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Jamming"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplify and forward communication","cooperative communication","protocols"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["rate optimization","amplify-and-forward based cooperation","AF based cooperative protocol","eavesdropper node","transmission link","globe channel state information","transmission nodes","secrecy rate","bound method"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6765905","abstract":"In this paper, we proposed a scheme, with which the transmitted signals at the eavesdropper node can be nulled out to avoid intercepting in the case of one eavesdropper.

To achieve this demand, orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) has been proposed. In a wireless network, the transmitted signal of each user has independent channel fluctuation characteristics. By using this characteristic, the multiuser diversity (MUDiv) effect can be obtained, and MUDiv/OFDMA has been proposed. Before now, we have proposed a low complexity MUDiv/OFDMA. However, it degrades the system performance compared with the conventional MUDiv/OFDMA in the channel as a Pyramid model. To solve this problem, in this paper, we propose the method to mitigate the deep faded channel for a low complexity MUDiv/OFDMA with the relay node allocation.","doi":"10.1109/APCC.2013.6765906","publicationTitle":"2013 19th Asia-Pacific Conference on Communications (APCC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 19th Asia-Pacific Conference on Communications (APCC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6749272/6765904/06765906.pdf","startPage":"6","endPage":"11","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APCC.2013.6765906","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6765904","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Mitigated deep faded channel with relay node allocation for MUDiv/OFDMA","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6765906","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"29-31 Aug. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6765906/","displayDocTitle":"Mitigated deep faded channel with relay node allocation for MUDiv/OFDMA","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2013","accessionNumber":"14160918","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6765906/","conferenceDate":"29-31 Aug. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"13 March 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mitigated deep faded channel with relay node allocation for MUDiv/OFDMA","confLoc":"Denpasar, Indonesia","sourcePdf":"0021569764983.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047483S","chronDate":"29-31 Aug. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6749272","isNumber":"6765904","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6749272","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6765904","articleId":"6765906","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6765913,"authors":[{"name":"Shin'ichi Koike","affiliation":["Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Shin'ichi","lastName":"Koike","id":"37086679327"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6050-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-6048-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2163-0771"}],"articleNumber":"6765913","dbTime":"20 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":36},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Adaptive filters","Convergence","Noise","Correlation","Delays","Phase shift keying"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive filters","correlation theory","difference equations","digital communication","impulse noise","quadrature amplitude modulation","stochastic processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["impulsive noise environments","filter convergence","steady-state convergence behavior","transient convergence behavior","difference equations","filter input","observation noise","impulse noise","stochastic models","digital QAM systems","adaptive filters","CPhiA","correlation phase algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["adaptive filter","digital QAM","correlation phase","impulse noise","robust filtering"]}],"abstract":"This paper first describes Correlation Phase Algorithm (CPhiA) for adaptive filters to be used in digital QAM systems.

QO-STBC is full rate STBC constructed from relaxing orthogonality, and requires a decoder to search symbol pairs with ML decoding. Motivated by this, we have proposed single symbol decodable QO-STBC with full diversity. This code achieves full transmit rate and low system complexity. However, the proposed QO-STBC can achieve a throughput performance like SISO. In order to exploit the advantages of single symbol decodable QO-STBC, the combination of the proposed QO-STBC and an adaptive modulation has been considered. The system performances of non-adaptive QO-STBC, adaptive single symbol decodable QO-STBC are evaluated and compared.

However, due to insufficient signal strength this solution has difficulty in serving indoor users. To address this problem, the Femtocell, called the Home eNB(HeNB), system has been deployed in the LTE system. Since the HeNBs and the eNB use the same frequency band and the same frame structure, co-channel interference between HeNBs and eNB is unavoidable. To solve this problem, we propose a co-channel interference (CCI) avoidance scheme using the control information in the downlink subframe.

WOKSS's sampling theorem must exclude periodic functions. This paper first introduces a sampling theorem for periodic functions, and gives its physical meaning; this theorem is effective for functions that can be expressed as a finite Fourier series in the same way as WOKSS's theorem deals with a band-limited signal. Since many signals such as an Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) signal can be expressed by periodic functions, the sampling theorem can play an important role in a communications area. Extending the theorem, this paper proposes a sampling theorem for periodic functions with no minus frequency component of a finite Fourier series, and shows its example. In addition, we examine the OFDM signal generation and termination by applying sampling theorems for periodic functions including the proposed one.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6765946/","chronOrPublicationDate":"29-31 Aug. 2013","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"29-31 Aug. 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6765946/","dateOfInsertion":"13 March 2014","publicationDate":"Aug. 2013","accessionNumber":"14160930","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A sampling theorem for periodic functions with no minus frequency component and its application","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A sampling theorem for periodic functions with no minus frequency component and its application","confLoc":"Denpasar, Indonesia","sourcePdf":"0421569766247.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049301S","chronDate":"29-31 Aug. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6749272","isNumber":"6765904","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6749272","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6765904","articleId":"6765946","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6765947,"authors":[{"name":"Tanairat Mata","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Mie University, Mie, Japan"],"firstName":"Tanairat","lastName":"Mata","id":"37704984800"},{"name":"Katsuhiro Naito","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Mie University, Mie, Japan"],"firstName":"Katsuhiro","lastName":"Naito","id":"37562415100"},{"name":"Kazuo Mori","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Mie University, Mie, Japan"],"firstName":"Kazuo","lastName":"Mori","id":"37276437300"},{"name":"Hideo Kobayashi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Mie University, Mie, Japan"],"firstName":"Hideo","lastName":"Kobayashi","id":"37279510000"},{"name":"Pisit Boonsrimuang","affiliation":["Department of Telecommunication Engineering, King Mongkut's Institute of Technology Ladkrabang (KMITL), Bangkok, Thailand"],"firstName":"Pisit","lastName":"Boonsrimuang","id":"37327400700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6050-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-6048-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2163-0771"}],"articleNumber":"6765947","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":262},"abstract":"One of the major disadvantages of OFDM technique is the high PAPR in the time domain signal. The larger PAPR signal would cause the fatal degradation of BER performance and un-desirable spectrum regrowth in the nonlinear channel. One of the promising PAPR reduction methods is the Partial Transmit Sequence (PTS) method which can achieve better PAPR performance with reasonable computation complexity. But the PTS method is required to inform the side information to the receiver for the correct demodulation of data information by using the separate channel. To solve the above problem, this paper proposes a new PAPR reduction method without requiring the separate channel. The salient feature of the proposed method is to reduce the PAPR performance by reordering of clusters in the frequency domain at the transmitter and reconstructing the clusters by using the cluster ID under embedded in the data information at the receiver. The proposed method can achieve almost the same PAPR performance and computation complexity as those for the PTS method without requiring the transmission of side information. This paper presents various computer simulation results to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 19th Asia-Pacific Conference on Communications (APCC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6749272/6765904/06765947.pdf","startPage":"231","endPage":"236","publicationTitle":"2013 19th Asia-Pacific Conference on Communications (APCC)","doi":"10.1109/APCC.2013.6765947","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APCC.2013.6765947","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6765904","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6765947","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Proposal of PAPR reduction method for OFDM signal by re-ordering of clusters","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Peak to average power ratio","Time-domain analysis","Complexity theory","Frequency-domain analysis","Partial transmit sequences","Mathematical model"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error statistics","OFDM modulation","signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["PAPR reduction method","OFDM signal","cluster reordering","OFDM technique","time domain signal","PAPR signal","BER performance","nonlinear channel","PAPR reduction methods","partial transmit sequence","PTS method","computation complexity","data information","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["OFDM","PAPR","Re-Ordering","Clusters","PTS"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6765947/","chronOrPublicationDate":"29-31 Aug. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Proposal of PAPR reduction method for OFDM signal by re-ordering of clusters","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6765947/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2013","accessionNumber":"14160925","dateOfInsertion":"13 March 2014","conferenceDate":"29-31 Aug. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Proposal of PAPR reduction method for OFDM signal by re-ordering of clusters","confLoc":"Denpasar, Indonesia","sourcePdf":"0431569772973.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054482S","chronDate":"29-31 Aug. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6749272","isNumber":"6765904","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6749272","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6765904","articleId":"6765947","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6765953,"authors":[{"name":"Zhiyuan Jiang","affiliation":["Tsinghua National Laboratory for Information Science and Technology (TNList), Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Zhiyuan Jiang","id":"37087338057"},{"name":"Sheng Zhou","affiliation":["Tsinghua National Laboratory for Information Science and Technology (TNList), Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Sheng","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37402649100"},{"name":"Zhisheng Niu","affiliation":["Tsinghua National Laboratory for Information Science and Technology (TNList), Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zhisheng","lastName":"Niu","id":"37269009300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6050-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-6048-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2163-0771"}],"articleNumber":"6765953","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":156},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6765953","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power demand","MIMO","Radio frequency","Transmitting antennas","Antenna arrays","Base stations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["active antenna arrays","approximation theory","cellular radio","MIMO communication","telecommunication power management","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimal number-of-active antennas","optimal transmit power","downlink broadcast channel","ergodic sum capacity upper bound","CFA","closed-form approximations","total transmit power","N single-antenna users","Mtot-antenna BS","large-scale MIMO systems","large-scale multiple-input-multiple-output systems","sum rate requirement","large-scale antenna array","minimum base station power consumption"]}],"abstract":"In this paper we consider the minimum base station (BS) power consumption given the sum rate requirement in large-scale multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) systems.

However, channel state information (CSI) at the transmitter is indispensable for the interference alignment precoding matrices design. In spite of the fact that the CSI can be obtained through feedback from receivers to transmitters in a frequency-division duplex (FDD) system or through the reciprocity in a time-division duplex (TDD) system, it may be imperfect for the reason such as estimation inaccuracy, feedback delay and time-varying of channel. In this paper, the impact of imperfect CSI on the achievable sum rate of interference alignment network is considered and a channel prediction technique based on Kalman filtering is proposed to verify the theoretical analysis. Through analysing, we find that the sum rate performance of an interference aligned network is affected by an integrated parameter, i.e., the product of user number, transmit power and channel error variance. Simulation results reveal that the performance of interference alignment is more sensitive to the uncertainty of CSI at high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime than that at low SNR regime. It is also verified that the performance can be improved through channel prediction, comparing with interference alignment based on the delayed feedback CSI.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference","Receivers","Transmitters","Noise","Vectors","Prediction algorithms","Delays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frequency division multiplexing","interference suppression","Kalman filters","matrix algebra","precoding","radio networks","time division multiplexing","time-varying channels","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["receivers","delayed feedback CSI","SNR regime","signal-to-noise ratio","user number product","channel error variance","sum rate performance","Kalman filtering","channel prediction technique","imperfect CSI","time-varying channel","feedback delay","TDD system","time-division duplex system","FDD system","frequency-division duplex system","interference alignment precoding matrices design","transmitter","channel state information","K-user interference network","multiuser interference elimination","interference management technique","IA","interference alignment network","channel prediction"]}],"doi":"10.1109/APCC.2013.6765959","publicationTitle":"2013 19th Asia-Pacific Conference on Communications (APCC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 19th Asia-Pacific Conference on Communications (APCC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6749272/6765904/06765959.pdf","startPage":"293","endPage":"298","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6765904","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APCC.2013.6765959","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Achievable rate improvement through channel prediction for interference alignment","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6765959","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Achievable rate improvement through channel prediction for interference alignment","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6765959/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6765959/","accessionNumber":"14180339","conferenceDate":"29-31 Aug. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"13 March 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"29-31 Aug. 2013","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Achievable rate improvement through channel prediction for interference alignment","confLoc":"Denpasar, Indonesia","sourcePdf":"0551569765825.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.081137S","chronDate":"29-31 Aug. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6749272","isNumber":"6765904","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6749272","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6765904","articleId":"6765959","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6765973,"authors":[{"name":"Yi Yu","affiliation":["Dept. of Electrical & Computer Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"firstName":"Yi","lastName":"Yu","id":"38195368600"},{"name":"Chung Fatt Loh","affiliation":["Dept. of Electrical & Computer Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"firstName":"Chung Fatt","lastName":"Loh","id":"37086738782"},{"name":"Zhuoran Xu","affiliation":["Dept. of Electrical & Computer Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"firstName":"Zhuoran","lastName":"Xu","id":"37894078000"},{"name":"Changyuan Yu","affiliation":["Dept. of Electrical & Computer Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"firstName":"Changyuan","lastName":"Yu","id":"37278963900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6050-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-6048-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2163-0771"}],"articleNumber":"6765973","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":41},"abstract":"In this paper, we propose and demonstrate inband OSNR monitoring in 100-Gb/s PDM RZ-DQPSK system by using cost-effective low bandwidth sampling technique.

In this paper, the generalized energy detector (GED) is investigated, where the squaring operation of amplitude of received samples in conventional energy detector (CED) is replaced by an arbitrary positive operation p. Our aim is to study the effect of noise uncertainty on the detection performance of GED. We consider different distributions of noise uncertainty. Initially, uniform distribution of noise uncertainty is considered and an expression of the SNR wall for the same is derived. It is shown that the SNR wall for uniformly distributed noise uncertainty is independent of p. The study of the detection performance of GED is further extended for log-normally distributed noise uncertainty, where the SNR wall is calculated numerically.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"29-31 Aug. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6765974/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"14160961","publicationDate":"Aug. 2013","conferenceDate":"29-31 Aug. 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6765974/","dateOfInsertion":"13 March 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"SNR wall for generalized energy detection under noise uncertainty in cognitive radio","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SNR wall for generalized energy detection under noise uncertainty in cognitive radio","confLoc":"Denpasar, Indonesia","sourcePdf":"0701569766053.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07305S","chronDate":"29-31 Aug. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6749272","isNumber":"6765904","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6749272","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"6765904","articleId":"6765974","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6765990,"authors":[{"name":"Zhibin Luan","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Zhibin Luan","id":"37086766329"},{"name":"Yukui Pei","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Yukui Pei","id":"37275165500"},{"name":"Ning Ge","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Ning Ge","id":"37337989900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6050-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-6048-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2163-0771"}],"articleNumber":"6765990","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":115},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6765990","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decoding","Clocks","Iterative decoding","Manganese","Throughput","Convergence"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS integrated circuits","decoding","parity check codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fast convergence","area-efficient decoder","quasi-cyclic low-density parity-check codes","space communication systems","clock cycles","I/O resource","TSMC","CMOS technology"]}],"abstract":"The quasi-cyclic low-density parity-check (QC-LDPC) codes have attracted much attention in space communication systems.

This paper presents a parallel pipelined decoder architecture for QC-LDPC codes, which can largely reduce their area and memory size while maintaining a fast convergence speed. The decoding approach reformulates the original normalized min-sum algorithm and adopts a two pipelines architecture to eliminate the clock cycles for the I/O and reduce the number of clock cycles per iteration.

Estimation of the unknown parameters of phase and frequency offset is called synchronization. The synchronization is typically performed once prior to the channel decoding by utilizing pilot symbols. Nowadays, turbo decoder can operate at low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). In low SNR region, the parameters estimation suffers from increased noise. Therefore, the conventional synchronizers can not synchronize receivers perfectly. The synchronization quality can be improved by combining the parameter estimation step with the iterations of turbo decoder which is known as code-aided turbo synchronization. However, if the synchronization is performed after each iteration of turbo decoder then it increases its latency which is not affordable due to tight latency budget. Moreover, as typical wireless communication standards support multiple modulations soit is desirable to design a single synchronization algorithm flexible for them. Due to the tight latency constraints, efficient hardware implementations are mandatory. Hardware implementations require fixed-point representation resulting in quantization losses. We present in this paper an efficient fixed-point realization of a code-aided synchronization algorithm well suited for hardware implementation. The synchronization can run in parallel to turbo decoder to keep its latency unaffected. Moreover, it provides flexibility for following multiple modulations: QPSK, 8-PSK and 16-QAM.

Clipping nonlinearites such as conventional clipping, blanking, joint blanking/clipping, and deep clipping have been proposed to mitigate the impulsive noise. However, OFDM systems result in high peak amplitude after inverse discrete Fourier transform (IDFT) at the transmitter, which leads to large peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR). High peak amplitude can be falsely clipped by the impulsive noise clipper at the receiver leading to poor system performance. In this paper we propose a joint peak amplitude clipping and impulsive noise clipping nonlinearities to improve the bit error rate (BER) performance.","doi":"10.1109/APCC.2013.6766012","publicationTitle":"2013 19th Asia-Pacific Conference on Communications (APCC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 19th Asia-Pacific Conference on Communications (APCC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6749272/6765904/06766012.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APCC.2013.6766012","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6765904","startPage":"567","endPage":"571","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint peak amplitude and impulsive noise clippings in OFDM-based power line communications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6766012","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Joint peak amplitude and impulsive noise clippings in OFDM-based power line communications","chronOrPublicationDate":"29-31 Aug. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6766012/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"29-31 Aug. 2013","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2013","accessionNumber":"14160939","dateOfInsertion":"13 March 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6766012/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint peak amplitude and impulsive noise clippings in OFDM-based power line communications","confLoc":"Denpasar, Indonesia","sourcePdf":"1081569774283.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.086015S","chronDate":"29-31 Aug. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6749272","isNumber":"6765904","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6749272","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6765904","articleId":"6766012","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":6766013,"authors":[{"name":"Regina Reine","affiliation":["Dept of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Curtin University Sarawak Campus, Miri, Sarawak, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Regina","lastName":"Reine","id":"38234932400"},{"name":"Zhuquan Zang","affiliation":["Dept of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Curtin University Sarawak Campus, Miri, Sarawak, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Zhuquan","lastName":"Zang","id":"37371177500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6050-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-6048-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2163-0771"}],"articleNumber":"6766013","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":147},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Peak to average power ratio","Pulse shaping methods","Finite impulse response filters","Quadratic programming","Baseband"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FIR filters","mean square error methods","mobile radio","pulse shaping circuits","quadratic programming"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["quadratic programming approach","FIR pulse shaping filter design","PAPR reduction","peak-to-average power ratio reduction","OFDM systems","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing system","wireless communication","pulse shaping technique","quadratic optimisation problem","weighted mean squared error minimisation","prescribed peak gain constraints","mobile communication networks","power efficiency"]}],"abstract":"The challenge of implementing Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) system in wireless communication is that the transmitted signal often exhibits a high peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR).

Doppler spreading due to the mobility of communication terminals or reflectors destroys the orthogonality among the subcarriers, and results in intercarrier interference (ICI). In this paper, we propose a multiple Doppler frequency offsets (DFOs) estimation based scheme to diminish the ICI in an OFDM transceiver for communication between a base station (BS) and a high-speed train. The proposed scheme utilizes a particularly designed preamble to estimate the DFOs by single receiving antenna, and preprocesses the received (downlink) OFDM symbol based on the DFOs estimates so that the post signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) gain can be obtained. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed scheme can effectively obtain the DFOs estimates and achieve an obvious SIR gain when there exists a strong line-of-sight (LoS) path between the BS and the high-speed train.","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 19th Asia-Pacific Conference on Communications

computational complexity and reliability. By introducing \u2113\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sub>\n -norm sparse constraint function into LMS algorithm, both zero-attracting least mean square (ZA-LMS) and reweighted zero-attracting least mean square (RZA-LMS) have been proposed for SMPC. It is well known that the performance of the SMPC is decided by regularization parameter which balances channel estimation error and sparse penalty strength. However, optimal regularization parameter selection has not yet considered in the two proposed algorithms. Based on the compressive sensing theory, in this paper, we explain the mathematical relationship between Lasso and LMS-type adaptive sparse algorithms. Later, an approximate optimal regulation parameter selection method is proposed for ZA-LMS and RZA-LMS, respectively. Monte Carlo based computer simulations are presented to show the effectiveness of our propose method.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APCC.2013.6766029","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6765904","publicationTitle":"2013 19th Asia-Pacific Conference on Communications (APCC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 19th Asia-Pacific Conference on Communications (APCC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6749272/6765904/06766029.pdf","endPage":"654","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Regularization selection method for LMS-type sparse multipath channel estimation","doi":"10.1109/APCC.2013.6766029","startPage":"649","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6766029","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"29-31 Aug. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Regularization selection method for LMS-type sparse multipath channel estimation","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6766029/","dateOfInsertion":"13 March 2014","accessionNumber":"14160980","publicationDate":"Aug. 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6766029/","conferenceDate":"29-31 Aug. 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Regularization selection method for LMS-type sparse multipath channel estimation","confLoc":"Denpasar, Indonesia","sourcePdf":"1251569754615.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071909S","chronDate":"29-31 Aug. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6749272","isNumber":"6765904","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6749272","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6765904","articleId":"6766029","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6766031,"authors":[{"name":"Youngmin Kim","affiliation":["Broadcasting System Research Department, ETRI, Daejeon, Korea"],"firstName":"Youngmin","lastName":"Kim","id":"37406972000"},{"name":"Jae Hyun Seo","affiliation":["Broadcasting System Research Department, ETRI, Daejeon, Korea"],"lastName":"Jae Hyun Seo","id":"37289631400"},{"name":"Heung Mook Kim","affiliation":["Broadcasting System Research Department, ETRI, Daejeon, Korea"],"lastName":"Heung Mook Kim","id":"37292766600"},{"name":"Sooyoung Kim","affiliation":["Electronics Eng., Chonbuk National University, Jeonju, Korea"],"firstName":"Sooyoung","lastName":"Kim","id":"37279282600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6050-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-6048-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2163-0771"}],"articleNumber":"6766031","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":186},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Complexity theory","Decoding","Noise","Iterative decoding","Turbo codes","Wireless communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","demodulation","estimation theory","least mean squares methods","linear antenna arrays","linear codes","MIMO communication","modulation coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["soft linear MMSE detection scheme","coded MIMO system","computationally efficient MIMO detection scheme","decoding","symbol-level information estimation","soft bit information extraction","symbol detection","linear order complexity","maximum likelihood detection","exponential complexity","computational algorithm","complexity reduction","modulation scheme","antenna"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["coded MIMO","soft detection","MMSE","turbo codes"]}],"abstract":"We propose a computationally efficient MIMO detection scheme which can provide accurate soft information to the decoder.

In the case of natural disasters or special event, it is required for satellite systems to allocate the frequency resources to a specific area as much as possible. Dynamic channel assignment is one of the attractive solutions to achieve the flexible and efficient utilization of the frequency resources. Although dynamic channel assignment can increase the bandwidth per satellite cell, smaller frequency reuse factor results in larger inter-cell interference and the link quality degradation. To solve this problem, this paper proposes centralized dynamic channel assignment based on interference measurement with link quality threshold control for multi-beam mobile satellite communications networks. It also shows the performance evaluation results by computer simulations regarding the blocking rate and the link quality.","publicationTitle":"2013 19th Asia-Pacific Conference on Communications (APCC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 19th Asia-Pacific Conference on Communications (APCC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6749272/6765904/06766037.pdf","startPage":"688","endPage":"692","doi":"10.1109/APCC.2013.6766037","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APCC.2013.6766037","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6765904","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamic channel assignment based on interference measurement with threshold for multi-beam mobile satellite networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6766037/","chronOrPublicationDate":"29-31 Aug. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic channel assignment based on interference measurement with threshold for multi-beam mobile satellite networks","htmlLink":"/document/6766037/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"13 March 2014","accessionNumber":"14180333","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"29-31 Aug. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic channel assignment based on interference measurement with threshold for multi-beam mobile satellite networks","confLoc":"Denpasar, Indonesia","sourcePdf":"1331569775099.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043043S","chronDate":"29-31 Aug. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6749272","isNumber":"6765904","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6749272","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6765904","articleId":"6766037","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6766041,"authors":[{"name":"Irma Zakia","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics, Institut Teknologi Bandung, Bandung, Indonesia"],"firstName":"Irma","lastName":"Zakia","id":"37072715000"},{"name":"Suhartono Tjondronegoro","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics, Institut Teknologi Bandung, Bandung, Indonesia"],"firstName":"Suhartono","lastName":"Tjondronegoro","id":"37370380000"},{"name":"Iskandar","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics, Institut Teknologi Bandung, Bandung, Indonesia"],"lastName":"Iskandar","id":"37296530300"},{"name":"Adit Kurniawan","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics, Institut Teknologi Bandung, Bandung, Indonesia"],"firstName":"Adit","lastName":"Kurniawan","id":"37393324400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6050-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-6048-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2163-0771"}],"articleNumber":"6766041","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":155},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Array signal processing","Rician channels","Bit error rate","Vectors","Fading","Receivers","Doppler shift"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","error statistics","least squares approximations","mean square error methods","radio receivers","Rayleigh channels","Rician channels","time-varying channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive MVDR","received LS beamforming","HAP system","minimum variance distortionless response","received least square beamforming","high altitude platform system","CAPANINA project","flat fading channel","downlink time varying Rician fading channel","mean square error","MSE","beamforming weight tracking","bit error rate","BER"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MVDR","least squares","beamforming","rician fading","time varying channel","HAP"]}],"abstract":"We consider the performance comparisons of adaptive Minimum Variance Distortionless Response (MVDR) and received Least Squares (LS) beamforming on the downlink channel from High Altitude Platform (HAP) to high speed train. The channel, as modeled in CAPANINA project, is considered as time varying rician and flat fading process. Since the rician factor is moderate to high, adaptive MVDR beamforming is attractive in compensating for the rician fading channel. Due to the constraint in the cost function, MVDR beamforming neglects useful received signal particularly in the lower rician factors, hence, mismatch occurs. By implementing the LS beamforming, the receiver is able to adapt better to a more rayleigh fading channel case.

The large-scale earthquake and tsunami affected many exchange office buildings and facilities. Further damage to services was caused due to the depletion of batteries associated with the prolonged disruption of the commercial power supply. The tremendous disaster caused service disruption to the communications infrastructure; in the case of NTT's facilities, approximately 1.5 million circuits for fixed lines and 4900 mobile base stations stopped working due to direct damage by the earthquake and/or tsunami or subsequent blackouts. However, more than 90 percent of the affected exchange offices and mobile base station equipment was restored by the end of March through an all-out effort by over 11,000 people. Even by the end of April, in areas where customers currently reside, service restoration has mostly been completed except for some areas experiencing construction difficulties, including damaged roads which made it difficult for workers to approach the site. In parallel with the restoration effort, a disaster emergency message service for voice, mobile, and the Internet was quickly provided in order to permit safety confirmation. The NTT Group installed temporary public telephones and Internet access environments, and also lent mobile phones, satellite mobile phones, and tablets free of charge to the affected people and government agencies. Since communication services are vital in modern society, we are making every effort to implement better countermeasures with future disasters in mind.","doi":"10.1109/MCOM.2014.6766080","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6766068","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MCOM.2014.6766080","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel7/35/6766068/06766080.pdf","startPage":"23","endPage":"29","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Experience of infrastructure damage caused by the Great East Japan Earthquake and countermeasures against future disasters","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 March 2014","displayDocTitle":"Experience of infrastructure damage caused by the Great East Japan Earthquake and countermeasures against future disasters","volume":"52","issue":"3","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2014","dateOfInsertion":"14 March 2014","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6766080/","publicationDate":"March 2014","accessionNumber":"14159251","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6766080/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Experience of infrastructure damage caused by the Great East Japan Earthquake and countermeasures against future disasters","sourcePdf":"012KOBAYASHI_LAYOUT.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038056S","chronDate":"March  2014","xplore-pub-id":"35","isNumber":"6766068","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"35","citationCount":"58","xplore-issue":"6766068","articleId":"6766080","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6766086,"authors":[{"name":"Kuan Zhang","affiliation":["University of Waterloo"],"bio":{"p":["Kuan Zhang [5'13] (k52zhang@bbcr.uwaterloo.ca) received his B.sc. degree in electrical and computer engineering and M.sc. degree in computer science from Northeastern University, China, in 2009 and 2011, respectively.

However, the flourishing of multimedia services is still hindered by inherent security and privacy concerns. In this article, we investigate the security and privacy issues of multimedia services by studying a newly emerging multimedia-oriented mobile social network (MMSN), which helps users receive multimedia services not only from their online social communities but also from their social friends in the vicinity. Specifically, we first define the MMSN architecture, and identify the unique security and privacy challenges. Then we study three MMSN applications: content query, service evaluation, and content filtering. For each application, we present the specific security and privacy problems with the corresponding countermeasures. Finally, we propose some future research directions in the MMSN.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6766086/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 March 2014","volume":"52","issue":"3","accessionNumber":"14159247","publicationDate":"March 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6766086/","dateOfInsertion":"14 March 2014","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Exploiting multimedia services in mobile social networks from security and privacy perspectives","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Exploiting multimedia services in mobile social networks from security and privacy perspectives","sourcePdf":"018ZHANG_LAYOUT.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.082443S","chronDate":"March  2014","xplore-pub-id":"35","isNumber":"6766068","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"35","citationCount":"53","xplore-issue":"6766068","articleId":"6766086","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6766087,"authors":[{"name":"Liang Zhou","affiliation":["Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications"],"bio":{"p":["Liang Zhou (liang.zhou@njupt.edu.cn) is with the Institute of Signal Processing and Transmission, Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications, China."]},"firstName":"Liang","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37288728900"},{"name":"Dan Wu","affiliation":["PLA University of Science and Technology"],"bio":{"p":["Dan Wu (wujing1958725@126.com) is with the Institute of Communications Engineering, PLA University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China."]},"firstName":"Dan","lastName":"Wu","id":"37595599700"},{"name":"Baoyu Zheng","affiliation":["Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications"],"bio":{"p":["Baoyu Zheng (zby@njupt.edu.cn) is with the Institute of Signal Processing and Transmission, Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications, China."]},"firstName":"Baoyu","lastName":"Zheng","id":"37272833700"},{"name":"Mohsen Guizani","affiliation":["Qatar University, Doha, Ad Dawhah, QA"],"bio":{"p":["Mohsen Guizani (mguizani@ieee.org) is with Qatar University."]},"firstName":"Mohsen","lastName":"Guizani","id":"37085436778"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0163-6804"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-1896"}],"articleNumber":"6766087","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":71,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2006},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6766087","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multimedia communication","Watermarking","Authentication","Wireless communication","Communication system security","Streaming media","Physical layer","Network security"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multimedia communication","signal processing","telecommunication security","watermarking"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["physical-application layer security","wireless multimedia delivery","wireless network","traditional wired network","malicious attack","physical layer information","application layer information","security capacity technology","signal processing technology","watermarking strategy","scalable multimedia security service"]}],"doi":"10.1109/MCOM.2014.6766087","endPage":"72","startPage":"66","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel7/35/6766068/06766087.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MCOM.2014.6766087","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6766068","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint physical-application layer security for wireless multimedia delivery","abstract":"In recent years, there have been increasing demands for the security of wireless multimedia applications. Essentially, wireless networks, compared to traditional wired networks, are more likely to suffer from malicious attacks. Most current security methods consider physical layer and application layer security technologies independently and separately. Usually, physical layer information is dynamic in wireless networks, and application layer information is related to wireless multimedia delivery. Importantly, both of them have significant impact on security performance. In this work, we propose a joint framework involving both the physical and application layer security technologies. Specifically, by exploiting the security capacity and signal processing technologies at the physical layer and the authentication and watermarking strategies at the application layer, the available network resources can be utilized efficiently. In addition, scalable multimedia security services can be maximized within the given multimedia delivery deadlines. In particular, this joint scheme can be implemented easily with low communication overhead, which facilitates its deployment in large-scale wireless multimedia systems.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 March 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6766087/","volume":"52","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/6766087/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"14159255","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 2014","dateOfInsertion":"14 March 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Joint physical-application layer security for wireless multimedia delivery","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint physical-application layer security for wireless multimedia delivery","sourcePdf":"019ZHOU_LAYOUT.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.088322S","chronDate":"March  2014","xplore-pub-id":"35","isNumber":"6766068","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"35","citationCount":"71","xplore-issue":"6766068","articleId":"6766087","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6766095,"authors":[{"name":"Kamran Arshad","bio":{"p":["Kamran Arshad received his Bachelor of Engineering and M.S. degrees in electrical engineering with distinction.

A framework for a twofold cognitive manager is presented; one part managing spectrum availability on longer timescales and the other handling resource management on shorter timescales. This article gives particular focus to the functionalities of the latter cognitive manager related to resource management. Finally, we present a few key scenarios and describe how QoS can be managed with the proposed approach without disturbing the communications of incumbent users.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6766095/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 March 2014","volume":"52","issue":"3","accessionNumber":"14159254","publicationDate":"March 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6766095/","dateOfInsertion":"14 March 2014","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Resource management for QoS support in cognitive radio networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Resource management for QoS support in cognitive radio networks","sourcePdf":"027MACKENZIE_LAYOUT.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.046831S","chronDate":"March  2014","xplore-pub-id":"35","isNumber":"6766068","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"35","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"6766068","articleId":"6766095","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6766096,"authors":[{"name":"Hani Mehrpouyan","affiliation":["Chalmers University of Technology"],"bio":{"p":["Hani Mehrpouyan [5'05, M' (hani.mehr@ieee.org) received his B.Sc. honours degree in computer engineering from Simon Fraser University, Canada, in 2004 and his Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from Queen's Univer-sity, Canada in 2010.

This article first reviews the available bandwidth and licensing regulations in the E-band. Subsequently, different propagation models (e.g., the ITU-R and Cane models) are compared against measurement results, and it is concluded that to meet specific availability requirements, E-band wireless systems may need to be designed with larger fade margins compared to microwave systems. A similar comparison is carried out between measurements and models for oscillator phase noise. It is confirmed that phase noise characteristics, which are neglected by the models used for narrowband systems, need to be taken into account for the wideband systems deployed in the E-band. Next, a new MIMO transceiver design, termed continuous aperture phased (CAP)-MIMO, is presented. Simulations show that CAP-MIMO enables E-band systems to achieve fiber-optic-like throughputs. Finally, it is argued that full-duplex relaying can be used to greatly enhance the coverage of E-band systems without sacrificing throughput, thus facilitating their application in establishing the backhaul of heterogeneous networks.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improving bandwidth efficiency in E-band communication systems","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","doi":"10.1109/MCOM.2014.6766096","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel7/35/6766068/06766096.pdf","startPage":"121","endPage":"128","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MCOM.2014.6766096","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6766068","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6766096","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6766096/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 March 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2014","displayDocTitle":"Improving bandwidth efficiency in E-band communication systems","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"52","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/6766096/","dateOfInsertion":"14 March 2014","publicationDate":"March 2014","accessionNumber":"14159252","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improving bandwidth efficiency in E-band communication systems","sourcePdf":"028MEHRPOUYAN_LAYOUT.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044029S","chronDate":"March  2014","xplore-pub-id":"35","isNumber":"6766068","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"35","citationCount":"37","xplore-issue":"6766068","articleId":"6766096","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6766097,"authors":[{"name":"Eduard A.

The focus of the study is on a specific resource sharing scenario: spectrum sharing between two operators in cellular downlink transmission. If frequency bands are allocated dynamically and exclusively to one operator - a case called orthogonal spectrum sharing - significant gains in terms of achievable throughput (spectrum sharing gains between 50 percent and 100 percent) and user satisfaction are reported for asymmetric scenarios at link and system level as well as from two hardware demonstrators. Additionally, if frequency bands are allocated simultaneously to two operators - a case called non-orthogonal spectrum sharing - further gains are reported. In order to achieve these, different enablers from hardware technologies and base station capabilities are required. However, we argue that all requirements are fulfilled in 3GPP and newer mobile standards.

The reference antenna figures of merit, for an isotropic channel environment, were chosen as efficiency, branch power ratio (BPR), and correlation. The objective of this work is to evaluate the radiated performance of the MIMO reference antennas using anisotropic (nonuniform power angular spread) channel environments. The performance of the reference antennas in anisotropic environments is different to that in an isotropic environment, due to the antenna orientation in the three-dimensional space relative to the channel. This leads to a statistical description of the branch power ratio (BPR), correlation, and efficiency, which is expressed in terms of mean effective gain (MEG). The outcome of this new anisotropic evaluation is that the reference antennas are seen to vary significantly for BPR and mean effective gain (MEG) and somewhat less for correlation, relative to the isotropic environment.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MIMO Reference Antennas Performance in Anisotropic Channel Environments","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2014.2311468","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel7/8/6823189/06766181.pdf","startPage":"3270","endPage":"3280","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2014.2311468","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6823189","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6766181","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6766181/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 March 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2014","displayDocTitle":"MIMO Reference Antennas Performance in Anisotropic Channel Environments","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"62","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/6766181/","dateOfInsertion":"29 May 2014","publicationDate":"June 2014","accessionNumber":"14349286","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MIMO Reference Antennas Performance in Anisotropic Channel Environments","sourcePdf":"tap-szini-2311468-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.130751S","chronDate":"June  2014","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"6823189","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6823189","articleId":"6766181","onlineDate":"12 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6766185,"authors":[{"name":"Sajjad Mohammadi","affiliation":["Electrical Machines and Transformers Research Laboratory, Department of Electrical Engineering, Amirkabir University of Technology, Tehran, Iran"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/6827271/6766185/moham-2311391-small.gif","p":["\nSajjad Mohammadi (S'13) received the B.S. degree (first class) in\nelectrical engineering from the Kermanshah University of Technology, Kermanshah, Iran, in 2011.

However, the turbulence-induced fading limits its application to short-range applications. To address this, we propose a multiuser diversity (MD) FSO scheme in which the Nth best user is selected and the channel fluctuations can be effectively exploited to produce a selection diversity gain. More specifically, we first present the statistics analysis for the considered system over both weak and strong atmospheric turbulence channels. Based on these statistics, the outage probability, bit-error rate performance, average capacity, diversity order, and coverage are analyzed. Results show that the diversity order for the gamma-gamma fading is N min{\u03b1, \u03b2}/2, where N is the number of users, and \u03b1 and \u03b2 are the channel fading parameters related to the effective atmospheric conditions of the link.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6766188/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 March 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2014","externalId":"7901217","publicationDate":"April 2014","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6766188/","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","accessionNumber":"14195240","volume":"6","issue":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Performance Analysis of Free-Space Optical Communication Systems With Multiuser Diversity Over Atmospheric Turbulence Channels","openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Performance Analysis of Free-Space Optical Communication Systems With Multiuser Diversity Over Atmospheric Turbulence Channels","sourcePdf":"jphot-yang-2311446-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.085849S","chronDate":"April  2014","xplore-pub-id":"4563994","isNumber":"6750774","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4563994","citationCount":"44","xplore-issue":"6750774","articleId":"6766188","onlineDate":"12 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6766190,"authors":[{"name":"Yong Wang","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Control of Power Transmission and Conversion, Ministry of Education, Department of Electrical Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/6827271/6766190/ywang-2311407-small.gif","p":["\nYong Wang (M'12) received the Ph.D. degree in power electronics from\nZhejiang University, Hangzhou, China, in 2005.","After receiving the Ph.D. degree, from 2005 to 2008, he was a Senior Researcher with the Samsung Advanced Institute\nof Technology, Yongin, Korea.

The approximation has been verified for two precommercial prototype WPT systems, the first of which, a 5-W system operating at 100 kHz, has been evaluated in this study; the second system been verified was reported in a separate study and operates at 6.78 MHz with a nominal current of 5.4 A rms. Based on the results obtained, the optimal operational frequency range for WPT with respect to compliance with exposure safety guidelines is revealed to be ca. 1-2.5 MHz.

In this paper, we argue that only connected is not enough, beyond that, general objects should have the capability to learn, think, and understand both physical and social worlds by themselves. This practical need impels us to develop a new paradigm, named cognitive Internet of Things (CIoT), to empower the current IoT with a \u201cbrain\u201d for high-level intelligence. Specifically, we first present a comprehensive definition for CIoT, primarily inspired by the effectiveness of human cognition. Then, we propose an operational framework of CIoT, which mainly characterizes the interactions among five fundamental cognitive tasks: perception-action cycle, massive data analytics, semantic derivation and knowledge discovery, intelligent decision-making, and on-demand service provisioning. Furthermore, we provide a systematic tutorial on key enabling techniques involved in the cognitive tasks. In addition, we also discuss the design of proper performance metrics on evaluating the enabling techniques. Last but not the least, we present the research challenges and open issues ahead. Building on the present work and potentially fruitful future studies, CIoT has the capability to bridge the physical world (with objects, resources, etc.) and the social world (with human demand, social behavior, etc.), and enhance smart resource allocation, automatic network operation, and intelligent service provisioning.","doi":"10.1109/JIOT.2014.2311513","publicationTitle":"IEEE Internet of Things Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Internet of Things Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/6488907/6811169/06766209.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JIOT.2014.2311513","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6811169","startPage":"129","endPage":"143","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cognitive Internet of Things: A New Paradigm Beyond Connection","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6766209","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Cognitive Internet of Things: A New Paradigm Beyond Connection","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6766209/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 March 2014","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"1","issue":"2","publicationDate":"April 2014","accessionNumber":"14299217","dateOfInsertion":"14 May 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6766209/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cognitive Internet of Things: A New Paradigm Beyond Connection","sourcePdf":"jiot-ding-2311513-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.100069S","chronDate":"April  2014","xplore-pub-id":"6488907","isNumber":"6811169","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6488907","citationCount":"304","xplore-issue":"6811169","articleId":"6766209","onlineDate":"12 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-28"},{"_id":6766212,"authors":[{"name":"Wangxin Huang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, College of Engineering, The University of Alabama, Tuscaloosa, AL, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/6827271/6766212/huang-2311389-small.gif","p":["\nWangxin Huang (S'12) received the Bachelor of Engineering degree in\nelectrical engineering from Central South University, Changsha, China, in 2011.

By using the proposed online impedance measurement method, there is no need to disconnect the battery from the system or to interrupt system operation, and there is no need to add ac signal injection circuits, costly response measurement, and analysis circuits/devices. In practical battery-powered systems, a power converter is usually used to interface the battery with the load for voltage/current regulation purposes. In this paper, through the control of the power converter and duty-cycle perturbation, the ac impedance of the battery can be determined. The proposed method provides a low-cost and practical solution for the online measurement of the ac impedance of batteries. Moreover, the proposed method can be either continuously or periodically performed without interrupting the normal operation of the battery system and the power converter. In addition, this paper provides an example where the obtained impedance data are utilized for online state-of-charge estimation of lithium-ion batteries. The proposed online impedance measurement method is validated by experiments conducted on a 2.6-Ah 18650-size lithium-ion battery interfaced to the load via a bidirectional dc-dc boost/buck converter.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 March 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6766212/","volume":"61","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/6766212/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"14351635","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"06 June 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"An Online Battery Impedance Measurement Method Using DC\u2013DC Power Converter Control","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Alabama National Aeronautics Space Administration Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR) Research Infrastructure Development","grantNumber":"NNX13AB09A"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Online Battery Impedance Measurement Method Using DC\u2013DC Power Converter Control","sourcePdf":"tie-abuqahouq-2311389-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.064102S","chronDate":"Nov.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"6827271","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"124","xplore-issue":"6827271","articleId":"6766212","onlineDate":"12 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6766216,"authors":[{"name":"Yo-Seb Jeon","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Pohang University of Science and Technology (POSTECH), Pohang, Korea"],"firstName":"Yo-Seb","lastName":"Jeon","id":"37085625220"},{"name":"Young-Jin Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Pohang University of Science and Technology (POSTECH), Pohang, Korea"],"firstName":"Young-Jin","lastName":"Kim","id":"37579072100"},{"name":"Moonsik Min","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Pohang University of Science and Technology (POSTECH), Pohang, Korea"],"firstName":"Moonsik","lastName":"Min","id":"38548365900"},{"name":"Gi-Hong Im","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Pohang University of Science and Technology (POSTECH), Pohang, Korea"],"firstName":"Gi-Hong","lastName":"Im","id":"37265558500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1070-9908"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2361"}],"articleNumber":"6766216","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":612},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Array signal processing","Vectors","Covariance matrices","MIMO","Degradation","Interference","Optimization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","cellular radio","MIMO communication","multiuser channels","search problems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed beamforming scheme","distributed block diagonalization","BD","multicell multiuser multiple-input multiple-output downlink systems","multicell MU-MIMO downlink systems","sum-rate degradation","selective zero-forcing constraints","ZF constraints","sum-rate maximization problem","search algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Coordinated beamforming","distributed beamforming","inter-cell interference"]}],"abstract":"This letter proposes a distributed beamforming scheme based on block diagonalization (BD) for multicell multiuser multiple-input multiple-output (MU-MIMO) downlink systems.

To overcome this problem, we introduce a sum-rate maximization problem for BD, to find the optimal selection of ZF constraints. Then we propose a search algorithm to solve the problem in a distributed and heuristic manner. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme effectively finds a near-optimal solution and significantly improves simple extended BD such that it can provide higher sum rate than the conventional schemes.","doi":"10.1109/LSP.2014.2311459","publicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/97/6750780/06766216.pdf","startPage":"605","endPage":"609","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LSP.2014.2311459","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6750780","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed Block Diagonalization with Selective Zero Forcing for Multicell MU-MIMO Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6766216","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 March 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6766216/","displayDocTitle":"Distributed Block Diagonalization with Selective Zero Forcing for Multicell MU-MIMO Systems","volume":"21","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 2014","accessionNumber":"14178880","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6766216/","dateOfInsertion":"20 March 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed Block Diagonalization with Selective Zero Forcing for Multicell MU-MIMO Systems","sourcePdf":"lsp-im-2311459-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.055626S","chronDate":"May  2014","xplore-pub-id":"97","isNumber":"6750780","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"97","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6750780","articleId":"6766216","onlineDate":"12 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6766223,"authors":[{"name":"Hongbo Li","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Technology, State Key Laboratory of Intelligent Technology and Systems, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/6827271/6766223/li-2311411-small.gif","p":["\nHongbo Li (M'12) received the Ph.D. degree from the Department of\nComputer Science and Technology, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, in 2009.","He is currently an Assistant Professor with the Department of Computer Science and Technology, Tsinghua University.\nHis research interests include networked control systems and intelligent control."]},"firstName":"Hongbo","lastName":"Li","id":"37086634320"},{"name":"Hongjiu Yang","affiliation":["Institute of Electrical Engineering, Yanshan University, Qinhuangdao, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/6827271/6766223/yang-2311411-small.gif","p":["\nHongjiu Yang received the Ph.D. degree from the Beijing Institute of\nTechnology, Beijing, China, in 2011.","He is currently a Teacher with the Department of Automation, Institute of Electrical Engineering, Yanshan University,\nQinhuangdao, China.

Simulation and experimental results are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sliding-Mode Predictive Control of Networked Control Systems Under a Multiple-Packet Transmission Policy","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2014.2311411","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/41/6827271/06766223.pdf","startPage":"6234","endPage":"6243","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2014.2311411","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6827271","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6766223","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6766223/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 March 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2014","displayDocTitle":"Sliding-Mode Predictive Control of Networked Control Systems Under a Multiple-Packet Transmission Policy","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"61","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/6766223/","dateOfInsertion":"06 June 2014","publicationDate":"Nov. 2014","accessionNumber":"14363505","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program)","grantNumber":"2012CB821206"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61174069 and 51374082"},{"fundingName":"Beijing Natural Science Foundation","grantNumber":"4122037"},{"fundingName":"Tsinghua University Initiative Scientific Research Program","grantNumber":"20131089295"},{"fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61225015"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61203023"},{"fundingName":"Postdoctoral Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"2012M510769"},{"fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Hebei Education Department","grantNumber":"Q2012060"},{"fundingName":"Hebei Provincial Natural Science Fund","grantNumber":"F2013203092"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sliding-Mode Predictive Control of Networked Control Systems Under a Multiple-Packet Transmission Policy","sourcePdf":"tie-li-2311411-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.080054S","chronDate":"Nov.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"6827271","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"42","xplore-issue":"6827271","articleId":"6766223","onlineDate":"12 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-30"},{"_id":6766225,"authors":[{"name":"Hongying Tang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Shanghai Jiaotong University, Shanghai, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/6949175/6766225/tang-2311472-small.gif","p":["\nHongying Tang received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electronic\nengineering from the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China, and Shanghai Jiao Tong\nUniversity, Shanghai, China, in 2007 and 2009, respectively.

Considering that the channel state information (CSI) from relays to a destination is imperfect, we aim to maximize the worst-case received signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). The associated optimization problem is then solved in two steps. In the first step, by fixing the source BF vector, a semi-closed-form solution of the relay BF matrices is obtained, up to a power-allocation factor. In the second step, the global optimal source BF vector is obtained based on the polyblock outer approximation (PA) algorithm. We also propose two low-complexity methods for obtaining the source BF vector, which differ in their complexity and performances. The optimal joint source and relay BF solution obtained by the proposed algorithms serves as the benchmark for evaluating the existing schemes and the proposed low-complexity methods. Simulation results show that the proposed robust design can significantly reduce the sensitivity of the channel uncertainty to the system performance.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2014.2311472","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/6949175/06766225.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6949175","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2014.2311472","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","startPage":"4422","endPage":"4435","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Achieving Global Optimality for Joint Source and Relay Beamforming Design in Two-Hop Relay Channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6766225","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 March 2014","displayDocTitle":"Achieving Global Optimality for Joint Source and Relay Beamforming Design in Two-Hop Relay Channels","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6766225/","volume":"63","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/6766225/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2014","accessionNumber":"14735178","dateOfInsertion":"06 November 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Basic Research Program (973 Program)","grantNumber":"2012CB316106"},{"fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61161130529 and 61328101"},{"fundingName":"Science and Technology Commission of Shanghai Municipality through the Science and Technology Innovation Program","grantNumber":"13510711200"},{"fundingName":"Southeast University National Key Laboratory on Mobile Communications","grantNumber":"2013D11"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Achieving Global Optimality for Joint Source and Relay Beamforming Design in Two-Hop Relay Channels","sourcePdf":"tvt-chen-2311472-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.138551S","chronDate":"Nov.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"6949175","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6949175","articleId":"6766225","onlineDate":"12 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6766229,"authors":[{"name":"Chris J.

As species, they have not only survived but have thrived in all their individual environments, often solely reliant on echolocation. All of these creatures are inherently cognitive. They all maintain a perception of their environment through the nervous system that allows them to take actions. In this paper, we focus on the bat as an example of a cognitive system exploiting a memory-driven perception-action cycle, enabling it to navigate and interact with its environment. The key conceptual components of cognition and how it could be applied to man-made echoic sensors is introduced. This is followed by a description of how echoic flow fields, a bio-inspired technique that bats have been shown to use, fit guidance, and control problems. We then go on to explain how bats are able to reliably distinguish between different targets. A combination of the theory and examples is used to demonstrate the vast potential for advancing the capability of made in man-made systems by adopting aspects of natural echolocating cognitive dynamic systems.","doi":"10.1109/JPROC.2014.2306252","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel7/5/6777968/06766229.pdf","startPage":"447","endPage":"458","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JPROC.2014.2306252","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6777968","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Biomimetic Echolocation With Application to Radar and Sonar Sensing","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6766229/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 March 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2014","displayDocTitle":"Biomimetic Echolocation With Application to Radar and Sonar Sensing","volume":"102","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 2014","accessionNumber":"14196383","htmlLink":"/document/6766229/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"25 March 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Biomimetic Echolocation With Application to Radar and Sonar Sensing","sourcePdf":"jproc-baker-2306252-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.065148S","chronDate":"April  2014","xplore-pub-id":"5","isNumber":"6777968","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"6777968","articleId":"6766229","onlineDate":"12 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6766231,"authors":[{"name":"Junqi Jin","affiliation":["Department of Automation, State Key Laboratory of Intelligent Technologies and Systems, Tsinghua National Laboratory for Information Science and Technology, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6979/6910343/6766231/jin-2308281-small.gif","p":["\nJunqi Jin received the B.S. degree from Tsinghua University, Beijing,\nChina, in 2011, where he is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree in the Department of Automation."]},"firstName":"Junqi","lastName":"Jin","id":"37085589777"},{"name":"Kun Fu","affiliation":["Department of Automation, State Key Laboratory of Intelligent Technologies and Systems, Tsinghua National Laboratory for Information Science and Technology, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6979/6910343/6766231/fu-2308281-small.gif","p":["\nKun Fu received the B.S. degree from Tsinghua University, Beijing, China,\nin 2011, where he is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree in the Department of Automation."]},"firstName":"Kun","lastName":"Fu","id":"37085589029"},{"name":"Changshui Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Automation, State Key Laboratory of Intelligent Technologies and Systems, Tsinghua National Laboratory for Information Science and Technology, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6979/6910343/6766231/zhang-2308281-small.gif","p":["\nChangshui Zhang (M'02) received the B.S. degree in mathematics from\nPeking University, Beijing, China, in 1986 and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in control science and engineering from\nTsinghua University, Beijing, in 1989 and 1992, respectively.","In 1992 he joined the Department of Automation, Tsinghua University, where he is currently a Professor.

In this paper, we first group the major MOO metrics proposed to date according to four core performance criteria considered in the literature, namely, capacity, convergence, diversity, and convergence-diversity.

However, ELMs are primarily applied to supervised learning problems. Only a few existing research papers have used ELMs to explore unlabeled data. In this paper, we extend ELMs for both semi-supervised and unsupervised tasks based on the manifold regularization, thus greatly expanding the applicability of ELMs. The key advantages of the proposed algorithms are as follows: 1) both the semi-supervised ELM (SS-ELM) and the unsupervised ELM (US-ELM) exhibit learning capability and computational efficiency of ELMs; 2) both algorithms naturally handle multiclass classification or multicluster clustering; and 3) both algorithms are inductive and can handle unseen data at test time directly. Moreover, it is shown in this paper that all the supervised, semi-supervised, and unsupervised ELMs can actually be put into a unified framework. This provides new perspectives for understanding the mechanism of random feature mapping, which is the key concept in ELM theory. Empirical study on a wide range of data sets demonstrates that the proposed algorithms are competitive with the state-of-the-art semi-supervised or unsupervised learning algorithms in terms of accuracy and efficiency.","doi":"10.1109/TCYB.2014.2307349","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel7/6221036/6936410/06766243.pdf","startPage":"2405","endPage":"2417","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6936410","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCYB.2014.2307349","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Semi-Supervised and Unsupervised Extreme Learning Machines","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6766243","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2014","displayDocTitle":"Semi-Supervised and Unsupervised Extreme Learning Machines","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6766243/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"14759294","pubMedId":"25415946","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6766243/","volume":"44","issue":"12","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 March 2014","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61273233"},{"fundingName":"Research Fund for the Doctoral Program of Higher Education","grantNumber":"20120002110035 and 20130002130010"},{"fundingName":"National Key Technology Research and Development Program","grantNumber":"2012BAF01B03"},{"fundingName":"Project of China Ocean Association","grantNumber":"DY125-25-02"},{"fundingName":"Tsinghua University Initiative Scientific Research Program","grantNumber":"2011THZ07132"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Semi-Supervised and Unsupervised Extreme Learning Machines","sourcePdf":"tcyb-huang-2307349-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.166462S","chronDate":"Dec.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"6221036","isNumber":"6936410","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6221036","citationCount":"476","xplore-issue":"6936410","articleId":"6766243","onlineDate":"12 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-24"},{"_id":6766245,"authors":[{"name":"Hisamatsu Nakano","affiliation":["Faculty of Science and Engineering, Hosei University, Koganei, Tokyo, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8/6823189/6766245/6766245-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Hisamatsu Nakano (M'75\u2013SM'87\u2013F'92\u2013LF'11) received the Dr.E. degree from Hosei University, Tokyo, Japan, in 1974.","Since 1973, he has been a member of the faculty of Hosei University, where he is now a Professor at the Electronics and Electrical Engineering Department.

When all the inner side lengths are equal, a high gain beam is formed in the direction normal to substrate 2. This normal beam is tilted by changing the phase distribution of the electric field over a horizontal plane just above substrate 2. It is found that gradating the strip widths of the loops contributes to changing the phase distribution, forming a high-gain tilted beam. A system of M \u00d7 (2N - 1) = 9 \u00d7 9 shows an experimental maximum gain of 16.4 dBi for a 33\u00b0 beam tilt.

By exploiting the fact that close-by time points are highly correlated due to smoothness of the time-series, our model significantly reduces the number of covariance parameters to be estimated from O(d\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n) to O(Ld), where L is the number of mixture components and d is the dimensionality. Thus, our model is particularly effective for modeling high-dimensional time-series with limited number of instances in the minority positive class. In addition, the computational complexity for learning the model is only of the order O(Ln+d\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n) where n+ is the number of positively labeled samples. We conduct extensive classification experiments based on several well-known time-series data sets (both singleand multimodal) by first randomly generating synthetic instances from our learned mixture model to correct the imbalance. We then compare our results with several state-of-the-art oversampling techniques and the results demonstrate that when our proposed model is used in oversampling, the same support vector machines classifier achieves much better classification accuracy across the range of data sets. In fact, the proposed method achieves the best average performance 30 times out of 36 multimodal data sets according to the F-value metric. Our results are also highly competitive compared with nonoversampling-based classifiers for dealing with imbalanced time-series data sets.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6766252/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 March 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6766252/","dateOfInsertion":"20 November 2014","publicationDate":"Dec. 2014","accessionNumber":"14759089","pubMedId":"25420245","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"25","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A Parsimonious Mixture of Gaussian Trees Model for Oversampling in Imbalanced and Multimodal Time-Series Classification","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Parsimonious Mixture of Gaussian Trees Model for Oversampling in Imbalanced and Multimodal Time-Series Classification","sourcePdf":"tnnls-tan-2308321-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.1145S","chronDate":"Dec.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"5962385","isNumber":"6960135","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5962385","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"6960135","articleId":"6766252","onlineDate":"12 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6766256,"authors":[{"name":"Dan Wu","affiliation":["Institute of Communications Engineering, PLA University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/6832681/6766256/wu-2311580-small.gif","p":["\nDan Wu received the B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. degrees from PLA University of\nScience and Technology, Nanjing, China, in 2006, 2009, and 2012, respectively.","She is currently a Postdoctoral Researcher with the Institute of Communications Engineering, PLA University of\nScience and Technology.

However, these potential advantages hinge on intelligent resource sharing between potential D2D pairs and cellular users. In this paper, we study the problem of energy-efficient uplink resource sharing over mobile D2D multimedia communications underlaying cellular networks with multiple potential D2D pairs and cellular users. We first construct a novel analytical model of energy efficiency for different sharing modes, which takes into account quality-of-service (QoS) requirements and the spectrum utilization of each user. Then, we formulate the energy-efficient resource sharing problem as a nontransferable coalition formation game, with the characteristic function that accounts for the gains in terms of energy efficiency and the costs in terms of mutual interference. Moreover, we develop a distributed coalition formation algorithm based on the merge-and-split rule and the Pareto order. The distributed solution is characterized through novel stability notions and can be adapted to user mobility. From it, we obtain the energy-efficient sharing strategy on joint mode selection, uplink reusing allocation, and power management. Extensive simulation results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed game model and algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2014.2311580","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6832681","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2014.2311580","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/6832681/06766256.pdf","startPage":"2093","endPage":"2103","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy-Efficient Resource Sharing for Mobile Device-to-Device Multimedia Communications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 March 2014","displayDocTitle":"Energy-Efficient Resource Sharing for Mobile Device-to-Device Multimedia Communications","volume":"63","issue":"5","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun  2014","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2014","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6766256/","publicationDate":"Jun 2014","accessionNumber":"14379471","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6766256/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"State Key Development Program of Basic Research of China","grantNumber":"2013CB329005"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61301163, 61301162, 61322104 and 61201165"},{"fundingName":"Jiangsu Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"BK20130067"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy-Efficient Resource Sharing for Mobile Device-to-Device Multimedia Communications","sourcePdf":"tvt-zhou-2311580-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.0924S","chronDate":"Jun  2014","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"6832681","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"197","xplore-issue":"6832681","articleId":"6766256","onlineDate":"12 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6766257,"authors":[{"name":"Zhengpeng Wang","affiliation":["School of Automation and Electrical Engineering, University of Science and Technology Beijing, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/6827271/6766257/wang-2311386-small.gif","p":["\nZhengpeng Wang was born in Shandong, China, in 1981.

Utilizing multiple channels and duty cycling may help conserve energy because transmission collisions and idle listening can be reduced. Bursty traffic is common in UWSN; however, we do not find satisfactory solutions that can deliver this type of traffic efficiently in a duty-cycled environment. In this paper, we propose a dynamic duty-cycled multiple-rendezvous multichannel medium access control (DMM-MAC) protocol that is suitable for transmitting bursty traffic in a duty-cycled UWSN. Built on top of multiple-rendezvous multichannel MAC (MM-MAC), a node running DMM-MAC needs only one modem. DMM-MAC can operate in a more realistic multihop environment, instead of a simplified single-hop network, without the information of relative distances or propagation delays to other nodes. Utilizing the proposed dynamic duty cycling mechanism, nodes running DMM-MAC can deliver bursty traffic efficiently. Simulation results verify that DMM-MAC conserves energy and enhances network performance when compared to MM-MAC.","doi":"10.1109/JOE.2014.2304311","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7084202","startPage":"269","endPage":"276","pdfPath":"/iel7/48/7084202/06766270.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Oceanic Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Oceanic Engineering","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JOE.2014.2304311","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy-Efficient Multichannel MAC Protocol Design for Bursty Data Traffic in Underwater Sensor Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Media Access Protocol","Propagation delay","Wireless sensor networks","Receivers","Switches","Peer-to-peer computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["access protocols","marine communication","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy-efficient multichannel MAC protocol design","bursty data traffic","underwater sensor networks","UWSN","dynamic duty-cycled multiple-rendezvous multichannel medium access control protocol","DMM-MAC protocol","multihop environment"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Bursty traffic","duty cycle","medium access control (MAC) protocols","underwater sensor networks (UWSNs)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2015","displayDocTitle":"Energy-Efficient Multichannel MAC Protocol Design for Bursty Data Traffic in Underwater Sensor Networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6766270/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 March 2014","dateOfInsertion":"10 April 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"40","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/6766270/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"15041010","publicationDate":"April 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy-Efficient Multichannel MAC Protocol Design for Bursty Data Traffic in Underwater Sensor Networks","sourcePdf":"joe-chao-2304311-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.200165S","chronDate":"April  2015","xplore-pub-id":"48","isNumber":"7084202","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"48","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"7084202","articleId":"6766270","onlineDate":"12 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6766271,"authors":[{"name":"Xiu Yin Zhang","affiliation":["South China University of Technology, School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Xiu Yin","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37291969000"},{"name":"Qing-Yi Guo","affiliation":["South China University of Technology, School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Qing-Yi","lastName":"Guo","id":"37085471784"},{"name":"Kai-Xu Wang","affiliation":["South China University of Technology, School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Kai-Xu","lastName":"Wang","id":"38247577700"},{"name":"Bin-Jie Hu","affiliation":["South China University of Technology, School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Bin-Jie","lastName":"Hu","id":"37401488200"},{"name":"Hong Lin Zhang","affiliation":["South China University of Technology, School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Hong Lin","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37859166800"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1531-1309"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-1764"}],"articleNumber":"6766271","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":32,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1461},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society","url":"http://www.mtt.org/"}],"abstract":"This letter presents a novel compact crossover with bandpass responses.

Recently, \u201cgeographical load balancing\u201d has been proposed to reduce energy cost by exploiting the electricity price differences across regions. However, this reduction of cost can paradoxically increase total energy use. We explore whether the geographical diversity of Internet-scale systems can also provide environmental gains. Specifically, we explore whether geographical load balancing can encourage use of \u201cgreen\u201d renewable energy and reduce use of \u201cbrown\u201d fossil fuel energy. We make two contributions. First, we derive three distributed algorithms for achieving optimal geographical load balancing.

By comparing different information structures that combine front sensors, rear sensors, and wireless communication channels, as well as different information contents such as distances, speeds, and drivers' actions, we reveal a number of intrinsic relationships between vehicle coordination and communications in platoons.

These new circuits are a compromise between the advantages of classical waveguide technologies, such as high quality factor and low losses, and the advantages of planar circuits, such as low cost and easy compact integration. Although their quality factor and losses are better than for planar circuits, these characteristics are worse than in the case of waveguides, mainly due to the presence of the dielectric substrate. In order to improve the performance of the integrated circuits, a new methodology for manufacturing empty waveguides, without a dielectric substrate, but at the same time completely integrated in a planar substrate, is proposed in this work. A wideband transition with return losses greater than 20 dB in the whole bandwith of the waveguide allows the integration of the empty waveguide into the planar substrate so that the waveguide can be directly accessed with a microstrip line. Therefore, a microwave circuit integrated in a planar substrate, but at the same time with a very high quality factor (measured quality factor is 4.5 times higher than for the same filter in the substrate integrated waveguide), and very low losses is successfully achieved.","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.2014.2309637","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel7/22/6782343/06766283.pdf","startPage":"832","endPage":"839","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.2014.2309637","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6782343","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Novel Empty Substrate Integrated Waveguide for High-Performance Microwave Integrated Circuits","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 March 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6766283/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2014","displayDocTitle":"Novel Empty Substrate Integrated Waveguide for High-Performance Microwave Integrated Circuits","dateOfInsertion":"02 April 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6766283/","accessionNumber":"14209887","volume":"62","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 2014","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Novel Empty Substrate Integrated Waveguide for High-Performance Microwave Integrated Circuits","sourcePdf":"tmtt-belenguer-2309637-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.069768S","chronDate":"April  2014","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"6782343","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"101","xplore-issue":"6782343","articleId":"6766283","onlineDate":"12 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6766287,"authors":[{"name":"Yang Liu","affiliation":["Center for Advanced Computer Studies, University of Louisiana at Lafayette, Lafayette, LA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/6949175/6766287/liu-2311450-small.gif","p":["\nYang Liu (S'11) received the B.E. degree in electrical engineering and\nits automation and the M.E. degree in control theory and control engineering from Harbin Engineering University, Harbin,\nChina, in 2008 and 2010, respectively.

The QoS-aware delivery probability (QDP) is introduced to reflect the capability of a node to deliver data to a destination within a given delay budget. Each node maintains a set of QDPs to make autonomous decisions for QoS-aware data transmission. At the same time, a prioritized queue is employed by each mobile node. To support efficient prioritization and redundancy control, the priority is determined by a function of traffic class and data redundancy. The former is predetermined by the corresponding application, whereas the latter is dynamically estimated during data delivery. Two experiments are carried out to demonstrate and evaluate the proposed QoS-aware data delivery scheme. The first experiment involves multiple clusters of static Crossbow sensors that are connected by air and ground mobile nodes with controlled mobility. The second experiment is under a mobile social network setting, where 23 Dell Streak Android tablets are carried by volunteers with arbitrary and diverse mobility patterns over a period of two weeks. Moreover, simulation results are obtained under DieselNet trace and power-law mobility model to study scalability and performance trends. Our experiments and simulations demonstrate that the proposed scheme achieves efficient resource allocation according to the desired delay budget and, thus, supports effective QoS provisioning.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6766287/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 March 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6766287/","dateOfInsertion":"06 November 2014","publicationDate":"Nov. 2014","accessionNumber":"14735191","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"63","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Efficient Quality-of-Service (QoS) Support in Mobile Opportunistic Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient Quality-of-Service (QoS) Support in Mobile Opportunistic Networks","sourcePdf":"tvt-liu-2311450-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.167156S","chronDate":"Nov.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"6949175","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"33","xplore-issue":"6949175","articleId":"6766287","onlineDate":"12 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6766288,"authors":[{"name":"Jianchao Zheng","affiliation":["College of Communications Engineering, PLA University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Jianchao","lastName":"Zheng","id":"38238014300"},{"name":"Yueming Cai","affiliation":["College of Communications Engineering, PLA University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Yueming","lastName":"Cai","id":"37290653400"},{"name":"Yuhua Xu","affiliation":["College of Communications Engineering, PLA University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Yuhua","lastName":"Xu","id":"37596320600"},{"name":"Alagan Anpalagan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Ryerson University, Toronto, ON, Canada"],"firstName":"Alagan","lastName":"Anpalagan","id":"37270506600"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9545"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1939-9359"}],"articleNumber":"6766288","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":42,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":813},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Vehicular Technology Society","url":"http://www.vtsociety.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference","Manganese","Games","Heuristic algorithms","Vehicle dynamics","Algorithm design and analysis","Information exchange"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel allocation","computational complexity","game theory","interference suppression","learning (artificial intelligence)","radiofrequency interference","telecommunication computing","time-varying channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed channel selection","interference mitigation","dynamic environment","game-theoretic stochastic learning solution","canonical communication network","solution optimal property","distributed no-regret learning algorithm","channel adaptation","near-optimal performance achievement"]},{"kwd":["Distributed channel allocation","dynamic environment","interference mitigation","no-regret learning","potential game"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6766288","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2014.2311496","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","abstract":"In this paper, we investigate the problem of distributed channel selection for interference mitigation in a canonical communication network.

DGs are often connected to a grid by power inverters. The inverters used in DGs are generally controlled by a phase-locked loop (PLL) in order to be synchronized with the grid. In a stability point of view, the power system will be significantly affected if the capacity of inverter-based DGs becomes larger and larger. The concept of the virtual synchronous generator (VSG), which is used to control inverters to behave like a real synchronous generator, can be considered as a solution. The VSG can produce virtual inertia from energy storage during a short operation time, and the active power can be produced by a VSG similar to a synchronous generator. In this paper, an oscillation damping approach is developed for a DG using the VSG. The method is confirmed analytically, and verified through computer simulations. Finally, some laboratory experiments are conducted using 10-kW inverters and a transmission-line simulator.","doi":"10.1109/TPWRD.2013.2281359","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6776443","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRD.2013.2281359","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","pdfPath":"/iel7/61/6776443/06766293.pdf","startPage":"668","endPage":"676","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Oscillation Damping of a Distributed Generator Using a Virtual Synchronous Generator","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 March 2014","displayDocTitle":"Oscillation Damping of a Distributed Generator Using a Virtual Synchronous Generator","volume":"29","issue":"2","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2014","dateOfInsertion":"20 March 2014","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6766293/","publicationDate":"April 2014","accessionNumber":"14181385","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6766293/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Oscillation Damping of a Distributed Generator Using a Virtual Synchronous Generator","sourcePdf":"tpwrd-shintai-2281359-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.082919S","chronDate":"April  2014","xplore-pub-id":"61","isNumber":"6776443","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"61","citationCount":"270","xplore-issue":"6776443","articleId":"6766293","onlineDate":"12 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6766301,"authors":[{"name":"Francisco Paz","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/6827271/6766301/paz-2311414-small.gif","p":["\nFrancisco Paz (S'08) was born in La Plata, Argentina.

Among different strategies, the perturb and observe (P&O) algorithm has gained wide popularity due to its intuitive nature and simple implementation. However, such simplicity in P&O introduces two inherent issues, namely, an artificial perturbation that creates losses in steady-state operation and a limited ability to track transients in changing environmental conditions. This paper develops and discusses in detail an MPPT algorithm with zero oscillation and slope tracking to address those technical challenges. The strategy combines three techniques to improve steady-state behavior and transient operation: 1) idle operation on the maximum power point (MPP); 2) identification of the irradiance change through a natural perturbation; and 3) a simple multilevel adaptive tracking step. Two key elements, which form the foundation of the proposed solution, are investigated: 1) the suppression of the artificial perturb at the MPP; and 2) the indirect identification of irradiance change through a current-monitoring algorithm, which acts as a natural perturbation. The zero-oscillation adaptive step P&O strategy builds on these mechanisms to identify relevant information and to produce efficiency gains. As a result, the combined techniques achieve superior overall performance while maintaining simplicity of implementation. Simulations and experimental results are provided to validate the proposed strategy, and to illustrate its behavior in steady and transient operations.","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2014.2311414","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6827271","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2014.2311414","endPage":"6147","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/41/6827271/06766301.pdf","startPage":"6138","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Zero Oscillation and Irradiance Slope Tracking for Photovoltaic MPPT","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 March 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6766301/","displayDocTitle":"Zero Oscillation and Irradiance Slope Tracking for Photovoltaic MPPT","volume":"61","issue":"11","accessionNumber":"14351617","dateOfInsertion":"06 June 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6766301/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Zero Oscillation and Irradiance Slope Tracking for Photovoltaic MPPT","sourcePdf":"tie-ordonez-2311414-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.080209S","chronDate":"Nov.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"6827271","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"64","xplore-issue":"6827271","articleId":"6766301","onlineDate":"12 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":6766375,"authors":[{"name":"Saly S.

In the proposed method, Four OFDM symbols with time difference are generated by exploiting both the oversampled OFDM signal and the cyclic prefix, and a cost function is introduced for CFO estimation. The cost function is expressed as a cosine function. The estimator of the CFO requires three independent cost function values calculated at three different frequency offsets. Using the formula, the CFO can be estimated without searching all the frequency offset range. The proposed method is very suitable for real wireless environments since it requires only one OFDM symbol for blind reliable estimation of CFO. The computer simulations show that the performance of the proposed modified method is superior to that of the original method.","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 Second International Japan-Egypt Conference on Electronics, Communications and Computers (JEC-ECC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6747513/6766373/06766378.pdf","startPage":"18","endPage":"22","publicationTitle":"2013 Second International Japan-Egypt Conference on Electronics, Communications and Computers (JEC-ECC)","doi":"10.1109/JEC-ECC.2013.6766378","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JEC-ECC.2013.6766378","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6766373","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6766378","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A modified blind deterministic carrier frequency offset estimator for OFDM systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Cost function","Estimation","Frequency estimation","Bit error rate","Frequency conversion","Frequency division multiplexing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frequency estimation","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["modified blind deterministic carrier frequency offset estimator method","OFDM systems","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing systems","time difference","cyclic prefix","CFO estimation","real wireless environments","blind reliable estimation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Carrier frequency offset (CFO)","Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM)","oversampling","blind carrier frequency offset estimation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6766378/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 Dec. 2013","displayDocTitle":"A modified blind deterministic carrier frequency offset estimator for OFDM systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6766378/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","accessionNumber":"14160764","dateOfInsertion":"13 March 2014","conferenceDate":"17-19 Dec. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A modified blind deterministic carrier frequency offset estimator for OFDM systems","confLoc":"Cairo, Egypt","sourcePdf":"RP04103.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.03099S","chronDate":"17-19 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6747513","isNumber":"6766373","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6747513","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6766373","articleId":"6766378","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6766387,"authors":[{"name":"K.

Schedule length is investigated in case of fault free operation and in the presence of a processor fault and then the schedule length is averaged based on the probability of the schedule success and failure, then this average schedule length is optimized to the minimum to give the lowest possible makespan in both cases. Results show that our algorithm is able to maximize the system reliability without degrading schedule length, in fact increasing system reliability decrease the averaged schedule length and hence the system overall performance in all cases.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6766373","publicationTitle":"2013 Second International Japan-Egypt Conference on Electronics, Communications and Computers (JEC-ECC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 Second International Japan-Egypt Conference on Electronics, Communications and Computers (JEC-ECC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6747513/6766373/06766391.pdf","doi":"10.1109/JEC-ECC.2013.6766391","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JEC-ECC.2013.6766391","startPage":"88","endPage":"93","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fault tolerant heterogeneous MPSOC schedule length minimization based on platform reliability","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 Dec. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6766391/","displayDocTitle":"Fault tolerant heterogeneous MPSOC schedule length minimization based on platform reliability","htmlLink":"/document/6766391/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"17-19 Dec. 2013","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"14160774","dateOfInsertion":"13 March 2014","publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fault tolerant heterogeneous MPSOC schedule length minimization based on platform reliability","confLoc":"Cairo, Egypt","sourcePdf":"RP17061.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051344S","chronDate":"17-19 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6747513","isNumber":"6766373","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6747513","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6766373","articleId":"6766391","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6766394,"authors":[{"name":"Hamada Esmaiel","affiliation":["School of Engineering, University of Tasmania, Hobart, Australia"],"firstName":"Hamada","lastName":"Esmaiel","id":"37086035050"},{"name":"Danchi Jiang","affiliation":["School of Engineering, University of Tasmania, Hobart, Australia"],"firstName":"Danchi","lastName":"Jiang","id":"37289756900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-3160-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6766394","dbTime":"17 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":263},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decision support systems","Computers","Silicon"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discrete cosine transforms","discrete Fourier transforms","error statistics","intercarrier interference","interference suppression","OFDM modulation","underwater acoustic communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["intercarrier interference reduction","pulse shaping function","underwater acoustic communications systems","multipath propagation","frequency selective fading","UWA communication","underwater channel","carrier frequency offset","side lobes","signal to interference ratio","SIR performance","discrete Fourier transform","DFT-based pulses","discrete cosine transform","DCT-based pulses","ICI power reduction","BER performances","IDCT-OFDM","bit error rate performance","signal pulse"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["underwater acoustic channel","IFFT-OFDM","IDCT-OFDM","pulse shaping","inter-carrier interferance"]}],"abstract":"Due to multipath propagation and frequency selective fading, there are many obstacles for reliable and high data rate underwater acoustic (UWA) communication. The effective use of OFDM in underwater channel also suffers from its high sensitivity to carrier frequency offset, which distorts the orthogonality between subcarriers due to Inter-Carrier Interference (ICI). Bandwidth limited systems often employ pulse shaping techniques for the reduction of ICI, and minimize the likelihood of errors at the receiver. Such reduction can be achieved by minimizing the side lobes as much as possible. Since the side lobes contribute to the ICI power, which also results in the decrease of Signal to Interference Ratio (SIR). In this paper, the ICI and SIR performance under pulse shaping technique is studied for underwater acoustic channel. Performance comparison of OFDM Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT)-based pulses and Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT)-based pulses is conducted. Simulation results show that, the modified raised cosine pulse shape technique can achieve better performance of ICI power reduction, SIR and BER performances for underwater acoustic channel in comparison to several other commonly used pulses. The IDCT-OFDM is strongly resistant to inter-carrier interference in underwater acoustic channel. The resultant system can also demonstrate reasonably good bit error rate performance. A system scheme is then proposed based on the identified signal pulse.","doi":"10.1109/JEC-ECC.2013.6766394","publicationTitle":"2013 Second International Japan-Egypt Conference on Electronics, Communications and Computers (JEC-ECC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 Second International Japan-Egypt Conference on Electronics, Communications and Computers (JEC-ECC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6747513/6766373/06766394.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JEC-ECC.2013.6766394","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6766373","startPage":"104","endPage":"109","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"OFDM Inter-Carrier Interference reduction using pulse shaping function for underwater acoustic communications systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6766394","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"OFDM Inter-Carrier Interference reduction using pulse shaping function for underwater acoustic communications systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 Dec. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6766394/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"17-19 Dec. 2013","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","accessionNumber":"14160776","dateOfInsertion":"13 March 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6766394/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"OFDM Inter-Carrier Interference reduction using pulse shaping function for underwater acoustic communications systems","confLoc":"Cairo, Egypt","sourcePdf":"RP20045.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.083355S","chronDate":"17-19 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6747513","isNumber":"6766373","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6747513","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6766373","articleId":"6766394","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6766395,"authors":[{"name":"Ibrahim Al-Nahhal","affiliation":["Dept. of Electronics and Communications Engineering, Egypt-Japan University of Science and Technology, Borg El-Arab, Alexandria, 21934.

We derive a closed-form solution for the covariance matrix of the transmitted signal at the relay which enables a performance evaluation of a wide range of transceivers.

Using asymptotic analysis, we show that the proposed code structure achieves desired anytime properties.","doi":"10.1109/AusCTW.2014.6766425","publicationTitle":"2014 Australian Communications Theory Workshop (AusCTW)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 Australian Communications Theory Workshop (AusCTW)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6761206/6766413/06766425.pdf","startPage":"39","endPage":"44","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AusCTW.2014.6766425","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6766413","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Anytime spatially coupled codes for relay channel","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Anytime spatially coupled codes for relay channel","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"13 March 2014","accessionNumber":"14180396","publicationDate":"Feb. 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6766425/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6766425/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 Feb. 2014","conferenceDate":"3-5 Feb. 2014","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Anytime spatially coupled codes for relay channel","confLoc":"Sydney, NSW, Australia","sourcePdf":"p39noorarahim.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.111016S","chronDate":"3-5 Feb. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6761206","isNumber":"6766413","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6761206","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6766413","articleId":"6766425","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6766427,"authors":[{"name":"Thomas Q.

The receiver uses an array of prisms to form channel matrices that can achieve angular diversity within a compact receiver structure. The transmission of light through a prism onto a photodetecting surface is analyzed showing that the channel gain depends on the orientation of the prisms. Thus, by arranging the prisms carefully, channel matrices with full rank can be formed in a multiple LED scenario, which facilitates the use of low complexity linear de-multiplexing algorithms, including zero-forcing (ZF) and minimum mean square error (MMSE). We present bit error rate (BER) results in a typical indoor scenario. It is shown that the BER varies with the position of the receiver, with relatively high values for the receiver located at the center and near the corners of the room.","doi":"10.1109/AusCTW.2014.6766427","publicationTitle":"2014 Australian Communications Theory Workshop (AusCTW)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 Australian Communications Theory Workshop (AusCTW)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6761206/6766413/06766427.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AusCTW.2014.6766427","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6766413","startPage":"51","endPage":"56","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance of indoor MIMO optical wireless system using linear receiver with prism array","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6766427","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Performance of indoor MIMO optical wireless system using linear receiver with prism array","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 Feb. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6766427/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"3-5 Feb. 2014","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2014","accessionNumber":"14161559","dateOfInsertion":"13 March 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6766427/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance of indoor MIMO optical wireless system using linear receiver with prism array","confLoc":"Sydney, NSW, Australia","sourcePdf":"p51wang.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075562S","chronDate":"3-5 Feb. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6761206","isNumber":"6766413","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6761206","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"6766413","articleId":"6766427","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6766428,"authors":[{"name":"Sinan Kahraman","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Systems Eng., Monash University, Melbourne, VIC, Australia"],"firstName":"Sinan","lastName":"Kahraman","id":"38229288900"},{"name":"Emanuele Viterbo","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Systems Eng., Monash University, Melbourne, VIC, Australia"],"firstName":"Emanuele","lastName":"Viterbo","id":"37284379900"},{"name":"Mehmet E. \u00c7elebi","affiliation":["Electronics and Communication Eng., Istanbul Technical University, Istanbul, Turkey"],"firstName":"Mehmet E.","lastName":"\u00c7elebi","id":"37295145000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-3354-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6766428","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":349},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6766428","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power capacitors","Complexity theory","Maximum likelihood decoding","Vegetation","Bit error rate","Simulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["AWGN channels","computational complexity","maximum likelihood decoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["polar codes","folded successive cancelation decoding","suboptimal decoder","quasilinear complexity","nonbinary SC decoder","folded tree maximum-likelihood decoding","additive white Gaussian noise channel"]}],"abstract":"Polar codes are the first explicit class of codes that are provably capacity-achieving under the successive cancelation (SC) decoding.

Increasing the number of feedback bits improves performance. However, this in turn requires a significant increase in the control channel bandwidth. The goal of the proposed reconfigurable antenna codebook scheme is to improve the closed-loop precoding gain without increasing the number of feedback bits. We employ reconfigurable antennas at the receiver resulting in multiple possible channel conditions. We have shown through simulations that increasing the number of receive antenna states has the same effect as a bigger codebook in terms of received signal to noise ratio gain, improved symbol error rate and sum rate gain. Different codeword and RA state selection methods are considered for both single and multi-layer transmissions and different system sizes, using LTE and Grassmannian codebooks with MMSE and SVD receivers.","doi":"10.1109/AusCTW.2014.6766429","publicationTitle":"2014 Australian Communications Theory Workshop (AusCTW)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 Australian Communications Theory Workshop (AusCTW)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6761206/6766413/06766429.pdf","startPage":"62","endPage":"67","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AusCTW.2014.6766429","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6766413","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reducing codebook loss by using reconfigurable receive antennas in limited feedback precoded MIMO systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6766429","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 Feb. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6766429/","displayDocTitle":"Reducing codebook loss by using reconfigurable receive antennas in limited feedback precoded MIMO systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2014","accessionNumber":"14161560","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6766429/","conferenceDate":"3-5 Feb. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"13 March 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reducing codebook loss by using reconfigurable receive antennas in limited feedback precoded MIMO systems","confLoc":"Sydney, NSW, Australia","sourcePdf":"p62afsheen.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055935S","chronDate":"3-5 Feb. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6761206","isNumber":"6766413","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6761206","xplore-issue":"6766413","articleId":"6766429","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6766430,"authors":[{"name":"Abdullah-Al-Nahid","affiliation":["Institute for Telecommunications Research, University of South Australia, Mawson Lakes, SA, Australia"],"lastName":"Abdullah-Al-Nahid","id":"37086686302"},{"name":"Khoa D.

The pilot contamination problem arises in multi-cell systems owing to transmission of the same pilots from users (or mobile stations) in different cells. The focus of this paper is to study the impact of different training sequences on pilot contamination in Massive MIMO systems. Specifically, we consider an adaptive beam-forming salgorithm which has been previously applied in MIMO interference networks. This algorithm uses bidirectional training in which training sequences are sent from current beamformers to adapt the mobile station receive filters and then the training sequences using mobile station filters as beamformers, are sent in reverse direction to adapt the beamformers at base station side. The adaptation of both transmit and receive filters is done using the least squares objective function. The adaptive beamforming algorithm shows improvement in performance in terms of average sum rate if the random training sequences are transmitted from users in different cells. Numerical results are presented to corroborate the mathematical analysis.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of adaptive least squares filtering in massive MIMO","publicationTitle":"2014 Australian Communications Theory Workshop (AusCTW)","doi":"10.1109/AusCTW.2014.6766434","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 Australian Communications Theory Workshop (AusCTW)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6761206/6766413/06766434.pdf","startPage":"90","endPage":"95","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AusCTW.2014.6766434","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6766413","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6766434","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6766434/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 Feb. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of adaptive least squares filtering in massive MIMO","conferenceDate":"3-5 Feb. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6766434/","dateOfInsertion":"13 March 2014","publicationDate":"Feb. 2014","accessionNumber":"14161554","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of adaptive least squares filtering in massive MIMO","confLoc":"Sydney, NSW, Australia","sourcePdf":"p90shaikh.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059599S","chronDate":"3-5 Feb. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6761206","isNumber":"6766413","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6761206","xplore-issue":"6766413","articleId":"6766434","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":6766437,"authors":[{"name":"Mengyu Huang","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Telecommunications, The University of New South Wales, Sydney, NSW, Australia"],"firstName":"Mengyu","lastName":"Huang","id":"37592134900"},{"name":"Jinhong Yuan","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Telecommunications, The University of New South Wales, Sydney, NSW, Australia"],"firstName":"Jinhong","lastName":"Yuan","id":"37281352700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-3354-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6766437","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":140},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Decoding","Antennas","Binary phase shift keying","Conferences","Interference","Signal to noise ratio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antennas","decoding","error statistics","linear codes","modulation coding","network coding","numerical analysis","phase shift keying","probability","Rayleigh channels","relay networks (telecommunication)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Alamouti scheme","TWRC","linear decoder","Rayleigh faded two-way relay channel","single antenna","BPSK modulated signal transmission","physical-layer network codeword","network coded information","bit error probability"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6766437","doi":"10.1109/AusCTW.2014.6766437","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AusCTW.2014.6766437","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6766413","publicationTitle":"2014 Australian Communications Theory Workshop (AusCTW)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 Australian Communications Theory Workshop (AusCTW)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6761206/6766413/06766437.pdf","startPage":"108","endPage":"113","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Physical-layer network coding with Alamouti scheme for the TWRC with linear decoder","abstract":"In this paper, we consider a Rayleigh faded two-way relay channel with two antennas at each user and a single antenna at the relay.

For the ergodic-capacity infinite-series, we describe a computation method and discuss its numerical instability issues.","doi":"10.1109/AusCTW.2014.6766438","publicationTitle":"2014 Australian Communications Theory Workshop (AusCTW)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 Australian Communications Theory Workshop (AusCTW)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6761206/6766413/06766438.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AusCTW.2014.6766438","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6766413","startPage":"114","endPage":"119","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Convergence analysis of performance-measure expressions for MIMO ZF under Rician fading","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6766438","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Convergence analysis of performance-measure expressions for MIMO ZF under Rician fading","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 Feb. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6766438/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"3-5 Feb. 2014","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2014","accessionNumber":"14161551","dateOfInsertion":"13 March 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6766438/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Convergence analysis of performance-measure expressions for MIMO ZF under Rician fading","confLoc":"Sydney, NSW, Australia","sourcePdf":"p114siriteanu.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.081687S","chronDate":"3-5 Feb. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6761206","isNumber":"6766413","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6761206","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6766413","articleId":"6766438","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6766440,"authors":[{"name":"Meng Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Melbourne, Australia"],"firstName":"Meng","lastName":"Wang","id":"38523248400"},{"name":"Tharaka Samarasinghe","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Systems Engineering, Monash University, Australia"],"firstName":"Tharaka","lastName":"Samarasinghe","id":"37712643100"},{"name":"Jamie S.

Trapping sets are topological structures in Tanner graphs of LDPC codes that are not correctly decoded by Belief Propagation (BP), leading to exhibit an error-floor in the Bit-Error Rate (BER). Stemming from statistical physics of spin glasses, GBP consists in passing messages between clusters of Tanner graph nodes in another graph called the region-graph. Here, we introduce a specific clustering of nodes, based on a novel local loopfree principle, that breaks trapping sets such that the resulting region-graph is locally loopfree. We then construct a hybrid decoder made of BP and GBP that proves to be a powerful decoder as it clearly improves the BER and defeats the error-floor.","doi":"10.1109/AusCTW.2014.6766441","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6766413","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AusCTW.2014.6766441","publicationTitle":"2014 Australian Communications Theory Workshop (AusCTW)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 Australian Communications Theory Workshop (AusCTW)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6761206/6766413/06766441.pdf","startPage":"132","endPage":"137","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Generalized Belief Propagation to break trapping sets in LDPC codes","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"3-5 Feb. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Generalized Belief Propagation to break trapping sets in LDPC codes","isConference":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 Feb. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"13 March 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6766441/","publicationDate":"Feb. 2014","accessionNumber":"14180398","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6766441/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Generalized Belief Propagation to break trapping sets in LDPC codes","confLoc":"Sydney, NSW, Australia","sourcePdf":"p132sibel.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.114794S","chronDate":"3-5 Feb. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6761206","isNumber":"6766413","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6761206","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6766413","articleId":"6766441","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6766444,"authors":[{"name":"Philip Whiting","affiliation":["Department of Engineering, Macquarie University, Sydney, NSW, Australia"],"firstName":"Philip","lastName":"Whiting","id":"37282295200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-3354-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6766444","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":103},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6766444","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","Approximation methods","Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","Estimation","Fading","Receiving antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","broadcast channels","fading channels","matrix algebra","OFDM modulation","time division multiplexing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["down link performance","time division duplex broadcast network","refined asymptotics","power normalization constant","TDD OFDM scheme","broadcasting","massive MIMO array","asymptotic formulas","antenna arrays","zero forcing matrix","Wishart matrix","channel model","fading amplitude"]}],"abstract":"A TDD OFDM scheme for broadcasting using a Massive MIMO array to a group of mobiles is considered.

Similarly, a design of a robot vision system that mimics human vision system and has the ability to autonomously explore unknown environment and acquires new knowledge is our main concern. In this paper we designed an advanced active vision system for humanoid robots that imitates human eye movements: saccade eye movements, pursuit eye movements, vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) eye movements as well as vergence eye movements. Besides, we proposed an open-loop servo controller for fast fixation on target together with a closed-loop servo controller for precise vergence operation. We also implemented VOR eye movements to stabilize vision during pursuit. We ran a real-time tracker to test our system and the experimental results showed that our system achieved promising performance of the similar eye movements as human vision system, which paves the road for our future humanoid robot research. The robust and real-time performance also showed that proposed bio-inspired robot vision system can be applied to various mobile robot applications for explorative and exploitative learning activities.","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 16th International Conference on Advanced Robotics (ICAR)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6755997/6766447/06766517.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2013 16th International Conference on Advanced Robotics (ICAR)","doi":"10.1109/ICAR.2013.6766517","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICAR.2013.6766517","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6766447","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6766517","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An advanced active vision system imitating human eye movements","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Machine vision","Cameras","Head","Visualization","Neck","Tracking","Robot vision systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["active vision","humanoid robots","robot vision"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["exploitative learning activities","mobile robot applications","bioinspired robot vision system","real-time performance","humanoid robot research","real-time tracker","precise vergence operation","closed loop servo controller","open loop servo controller","vergence eye movements","VOR eye movements","vestibulo-ocular reflex","saccade eye movements","humanoid robots","human vision system","surrounding environment","visual attention","human eye movements","advanced active vision system"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6766517/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-29 Nov. 2013","displayDocTitle":"An advanced active vision system imitating human eye movements","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6766517/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2013","accessionNumber":"14161443","dateOfInsertion":"13 March 2014","conferenceDate":"25-29 Nov. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An advanced active vision system imitating human eye movements","confLoc":"Montevideo, Uruguay","sourcePdf":"paper197.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066176S","chronDate":"25-29 Nov. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6755997","isNumber":"6766447","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6755997","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6766447","articleId":"6766517","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6766519,"authors":[{"name":"Hariharan Ananthanarayanan","affiliation":["University of Dayton"],"firstName":"Hariharan","lastName":"Ananthanarayanan","id":"38132158100"},{"name":"Ra\u00fal Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez","affiliation":["Dept. of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Dayton, Dayton, OH, U.S.A."],"firstName":"Ra\u00fal","lastName":"Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez","id":"37301363800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2722-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6766519","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":285},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wrist","Elbow","Joints","Kinematics","Manipulators","Equations","Real-time systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["end effectors","inverse problems","manipulator dynamics","manipulator kinematics","redundant manipulators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["EE","end effector orientation","end effector position","wrist position","numerical method","analytical method","hybrid method","Motoman IA20 redundant manipulator","IK","real-time inverse kinematics"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Inverse Kinematics","redundancy","Newton Rhapson","Decoupling","Obstacle Avoidance"]}],"abstract":"Inverse Kinematics (IK) of redundant manipulators has been an active research problem in the field of robotics for a long time. Many solutions exist, though the focus here is to solve the problem of inverse kinematics (both position and orientation) in real-time for a 7 DOF redundant manipulator with spherical wrist. In other words, a computationally efficient way. The approach taken here attempts to decouple the redundant manipulator at the wrist, thus solving for the first four angles satisfying the wrist position and the last three angles satisfying the End Effector (EE) position and orientation. A hybrid approach of using analytical and numerical methods is undertaken to improve the computational efficiency, and the performance is compared with pure numerical methods. Various paths are generated using this method and tested for performance in terms of accuracy and speed. Finally, simulations on a Motoman IA20 redundant manipulator are shown to display satisfactory performance.","doi":"10.1109/ICAR.2013.6766519","publicationTitle":"2013 16th International Conference on Advanced Robotics (ICAR)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 16th International Conference on Advanced Robotics (ICAR)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6755997/6766447/06766519.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICAR.2013.6766519","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6766447","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Real-time Inverse Kinematics of redundant manipulator using a hybrid (analytical and numerical) method","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6766519","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Real-time Inverse Kinematics of redundant manipulator using a hybrid (analytical and numerical) method","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-29 Nov. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6766519/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"25-29 Nov. 2013","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2013","accessionNumber":"14180390","dateOfInsertion":"13 March 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6766519/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Real-time Inverse Kinematics of redundant manipulator using a hybrid (analytical and numerical) method","confLoc":"Montevideo, Uruguay","sourcePdf":"paper2.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055256S","chronDate":"25-29 Nov. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6755997","isNumber":"6766447","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6755997","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6766447","articleId":"6766519","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6766582,"authors":[{"name":"Jose I.

A 1.2-kW battery charging system consisting of an LCL primary network, circular pads, and a series tuned secondary is designed.

Here, we consider the (unobservable) denoising problem of how to best approximate a low-rank signal matrix buried in noise by optimal (re)weighting of the singular vectors of the measurement matrix. We exploit recent results from random matrix theory to exactly characterize the large matrix limit of the optimal weighting coefficients and show that they can be computed directly from data for a large class of noise models that includes the independent identically distributed Gaussian noise case. Our analysis brings into sharp focus the shrinkage-and-thresholding form of the optimal weights, the nonconvex nature of the associated shrinkage function (on the singular values), and explains why matrix regularization via singular value thresholding with convex penalty functions (such as the nuclear norm) will always be suboptimal. We validate our theoretical predictions with numerical simulations, develop an implementable algorithm (OptShrink) that realizes the predicted performance gains and show how our methods can be used to improve estimation in the setting where the measured matrix has missing entries.","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2014.2311661","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2014.2311661","startPage":"3002","endPage":"3018","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel7/18/6800061/06766658.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6800061","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"OptShrink: An Algorithm for Improved Low-Rank Signal Matrix Denoising by Optimal, Data-Driven Singular Value Shrinkage","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 March 2014","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2014","displayDocTitle":"OptShrink: An Algorithm for Improved Low-Rank Signal Matrix Denoising by Optimal, Data-Driven Singular Value Shrinkage","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2014","dateOfInsertion":"18 April 2014","volume":"60","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6766658/","accessionNumber":"14239009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6766658/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"OptShrink: An Algorithm for Improved Low-Rank Signal Matrix Denoising by Optimal, Data-Driven Singular Value Shrinkage","sourcePdf":"tit-nadakuditi-2311661-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.162872S","chronDate":"May  2014","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"6800061","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"75","xplore-issue":"6800061","articleId":"6766658","onlineDate":"13 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-27"},{"_id":6766661,"authors":[{"name":"Ivan Stojmenovic","affiliation":["SEECS, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, ON, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6488907/6811169/6766661/6766661-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ivan Stojmenovic (A\u201998\u2013M\u201904\u2013M\u201905\u2013F\u201908) received the Ph.D. degree in mathematics from the University of Zagreb, Zagreb, Croatia, in 1985.","He is a Full Professor with the University of Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.

Our vision is CPS with distributed actuation and in-network processing. We describe few particular use cases that motivate the development of the M2M communication primitives tailored to large-scale CPS. M2M communications in literature were considered in limited extent so far. The existing work is based on small-scale M2M models and centralized solutions. Different sources discuss different primitives. Few existing decentralized solutions do not scale well. There is a need to design M2M communication primitives that will scale to thousands and trillions of M2M devices, without sacrificing solution quality. The main paradigm shift is to design localized algorithms, where CPS nodes make decisions based on local knowledge. Localized coordination and communication in networked robotics, for matching events and robots, were studied to illustrate new directions.","doi":"10.1109/JIOT.2014.2311693","publicationTitle":"IEEE Internet of Things Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Internet of Things Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/6488907/6811169/06766661.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JIOT.2014.2311693","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6811169","startPage":"122","endPage":"128","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Machine-to-Machine Communications With In-Network Data Aggregation, Processing, and Actuation for Large-Scale Cyber-Physical Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6766661","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Machine-to-Machine Communications With In-Network Data Aggregation, Processing, and Actuation for Large-Scale Cyber-Physical Systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6766661/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 March 2014","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"1","issue":"2","publicationDate":"April 2014","accessionNumber":"14299216","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6766661/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Machine-to-Machine Communications With In-Network Data Aggregation, Processing, and Actuation for Large-Scale Cyber-Physical Systems","sourcePdf":"jiot-stojmenovic-2311693-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.084447S","chronDate":"April  2014","xplore-pub-id":"6488907","isNumber":"6811169","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6488907","citationCount":"136","xplore-issue":"6811169","articleId":"6766661","onlineDate":"13 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6766663,"authors":[{"name":"Javier Martin-Martinez","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, Bellaterra, Spain"],"firstName":"Javier","lastName":"Martin-Martinez","id":"38275433400"},{"name":"Javier Diaz","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, Bellaterra, Spain"],"firstName":"Javier","lastName":"Diaz","id":"37085335860"},{"name":"Rosana Rodriguez","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, Bellaterra, Spain"],"firstName":"Rosana","lastName":"Rodriguez","id":"37288049700"},{"name":"Montserrat Nafria","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, Bellaterra, Spain"],"firstName":"Montserrat","lastName":"Nafria","id":"37273111400"},{"name":"Xavier Aymerich","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, Bellaterra, Spain"],"firstName":"Xavier","lastName":"Aymerich","id":"37317803100"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0741-3106"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0563"}],"articleNumber":"6766663","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":45,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":825},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Electron Devices Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/eds/"}],"abstract":"A new method for the characterization of random telegraph signals (RTSs) is presented.

Monitoring delays of all source-destination pairs in a large network are, however, challenging and wasteful of resources. This paper advocates a spatio-temporal Kalman filtering approach to construct network-wide delay maps using measurements on only a few paths. The proposed network cartography framework allows efficient tracking and prediction of delays by relying on both topological as well as historical data. Optimal paths for delay measurement are selected in an online fashion by leveraging the notion of submodularity. The resulting predictor is optimal in the class of linear predictors, and outperforms competing alternatives on real-world data sets.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel7/18/6800061/06766672.pdf","startPage":"2910","endPage":"2920","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2014.2311802","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2014.2311802","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6800061","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6766672","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamic Network Delay Cartography","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Delays","Covariance matrices","Vectors","IP networks","Kalman filters","Greedy algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fault diagnosis","filtering theory","Internet","IP networks","Kalman filters","telecommunication network planning","telecommunication network topology","telecommunication traffic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["submodularity optimization","network traffic volumes","Internet measurements","linear predictors","submodularity notion","delay measurement","delay prediction","delay tracking","network-wide delay maps","spatio-temporal Kalman filtering approach","source-destination pairs","planning","assessment","fault diagnosis","network operators","IP networks","path delays","dynamic network delay cartography"]},{"kwd":["Internet measurements","network kriging","kriged Kalman filter","delay prediction","submodularity optimization"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6766672/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 March 2014","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic Network Delay Cartography","volume":"60","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/6766672/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2014","accessionNumber":"14238993","dateOfInsertion":"17 April 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic Network Delay Cartography","sourcePdf":"tit-rajawat-2311802-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.097849S","chronDate":"May  2014","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"6800061","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"6800061","articleId":"6766672","onlineDate":"13 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6766704,"authors":[{"name":"Nariman Farsad","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, York University, Toronto, Ontario, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/6782402/6766704/6766704-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Nariman Farsad (S'07) received his B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees in computer science and engineering from York University, Toronto, ON, Canada in 2007 and 2009, respectively.

These particles are released by a transmitter into a fluidic environment, where they propagate freely (e.g. through diffusion) or through externals means (e.g. different types of active transport) until they arrive at the receiver. Although there are a number of different mathematical models for the diffusion-based molecular communication, active transport molecular communication (ATMC) lacks the necessary theoretical framework. Previous works had to rely almost entirely on full Monte Carlo simulations of these systems. However, full simulations can be time consuming because of the computational complexities involved. In this paper, a Markov channel model has been presented, which could be used to reduce the amount of simulations necessary for studying ATMC without sacrificing accuracy. Moreover, a mathematical formula for calculating the transition probabilities in the Markov chain model is derived to complete our analytical framework. Comparing our proposed models with full simulations, it is shown that these models can be used to calculate parameters such channel capacity accurately in a timely manner.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/78/6782402/06766704.pdf","startPage":"2424","endPage":"2436","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2014.2311970","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2014.2311970","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6782402","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6766704","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Markov Chain Channel Model for Active Transport Molecular Communication","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Mathematical model","Molecular communication","Markov processes","Computational modeling","Channel models","Transmitters","Receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Markov processes","molecular communication (telecommunication)","telecommunication channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Markov chain channel model","active transport molecular communication","fluidic environment","transition probability","channel capacity"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Biological information theory","channel capacity","Markov processes","mathematical model","molecular communication"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6766704/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May1,  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 March 2014","displayDocTitle":"A Markov Chain Channel Model for Active Transport Molecular Communication","volume":"62","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/6766704/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May1, 2014","accessionNumber":"14219736","dateOfInsertion":"08 April 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Markov Chain Channel Model for Active Transport Molecular Communication","sourcePdf":"tsp-farsad-2311970-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.094396S","chronDate":"May1,  2014","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"6782402","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"6782402","articleId":"6766704","onlineDate":"13 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6766708,"authors":[{"name":"Matthias Hotz","affiliation":["Technische Universit\u00e4t, Associate Institute for Signal Processing, M\u00fcnchen, Munich, Germany"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/6803925/6766708/6766708-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Matthias Hotz (S'12) received the B.Sc. and Dipl.-Ing. degrees in telematics (both with highest distinction) from Graz University of Technology, Austria, in 2010 and 2012, respectively.","He is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree at the Associate Institute for Signal Processing, Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen, Germany.

In this paper, a real-time capable post- and pre-linearization method for the widely applicable time-varying discrete-time Volterra series is presented. To this end, an alternative view on the Volterra series is established, which enables the utilization of certain modified linear iterative methods for linearization. For one particular linear iterative method, the Richardson iteration, the corresponding post- and pre-linearizers are discussed in detail. It is motivated that the resulting algorithm can be regarded as a generalization of some existing methods. Furthermore, a simply verifiable condition for convergence is presented, which allows the straightforward evaluation of applicability. The proposed method is demonstrated by means of the linearization of a time-varying nonlinear amplifier, which highlights its capability of linearizing significantly distorted signals, illustrates the advantageous convergence behavior, and depicts its robustness against modeling errors.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/78/6803925/06766708.pdf","startPage":"2566","endPage":"2579","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2014.2311965","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2014.2311965","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6803925","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6766708","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Linearization of Time-Varying Nonlinear Systems Using A Modified Linear Iterative Method","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Nonlinear systems","Convergence","Time-varying systems","Iterative methods","Approximation methods","Real-time systems","Signal processing algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discrete time systems","iterative methods","linearisation techniques","nonlinear systems","signal processing","time-varying systems","Volterra series"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["time-varying nonlinear system","modified linear iterative method","digital enhancement technique","pre-linearization method","post-linearization method","time-varying discrete-time Volterra series","Richardson iteration","time-varying nonlinear amplifier","signal distortion"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":[" $P$th-order inverse","digital predistortion","equalization","iterative methods","linearization","nonlinear systems","Richardson iteration","time-varying systems","Volterra series"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6766708/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May15,  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 March 2014","displayDocTitle":"Linearization of Time-Varying Nonlinear Systems Using A Modified Linear Iterative Method","volume":"62","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/6766708/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May15, 2014","accessionNumber":"14264378","dateOfInsertion":"24 April 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Linearization of Time-Varying Nonlinear Systems Using A Modified Linear Iterative Method","sourcePdf":"tsp-hotz-2311965-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.120998S","chronDate":"May15,  2014","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"6803925","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"6803925","articleId":"6766708","onlineDate":"13 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6766711,"authors":[{"name":"Sajid Ahmed","affiliation":["KAUST, Computer, Electrical, Mathematical Sciences and Engineering (CEMSE) Division, Thuwal, Makkah Province, Saudi Arabia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/6782402/6766711/6766711-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Sajid Ahmed (M'08\u2013SM'12) received the B.S in Electronics Engineering from Sir Syed University of Engineering and Technology Karachi, Pakistan in 1998 and M.

The design of the transmit beampattern generally requires the waveforms to have arbitrary auto- and cross-correlation properties. The generation of such waveforms is a two-step complicated process. In the first step, a waveform covariance matrix is synthesized, which is a constrained optimization problem. In the second step, to realize this covariance matrix actual waveforms are designed, which is also a constrained optimization problem. Our proposed scheme converts this two-step constrained optimization problem into a one-step unconstrained optimization problem. In the proposed scheme, in contrast to synthesizing the covariance matrix for the desired beampattern, nT-independent finite-alphabet constant-envelope waveforms are generated and preprocessed, with weight matrix W, before transmitting from the antennas. In this work, two weight matrices are proposed that can be easily optimized for the desired symmetric and nonsymmetric beampatterns and guarantee equal average power transmission from each antenna. Simulation results validate our claims.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/78/6782402/06766711.pdf","startPage":"2278","endPage":"2289","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2014.2310435","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2014.2310435","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6782402","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6766711","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MIMO Radar Transmit Beampattern Design Without Synthesising the Covariance Matrix","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Transmitting antennas","Covariance matrices","Optimization","Signal processing algorithms","MIMO radar","Radar antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","covariance matrices","MIMO radar","optimisation","radar receivers","radar transmitters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO radar transmit beampattern","covariance matrix","degrees-of-freedom","DOF","spatial resolution","parametric identifiability","sidelobe levels","transmitter-receiver","auto-correlation properties","cross-correlation properties","two-step constrained optimization problem","one-step unconstrained optimization problem","nT-independent finite-alphabet constant-envelope waveforms","weight matrix","antennas","power transmission"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Beampattern design","colocated antennas","geometric function","MIMO radar"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6766711/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May1,  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 March 2014","displayDocTitle":"MIMO Radar Transmit Beampattern Design Without Synthesising the Covariance Matrix","volume":"62","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/6766711/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May1, 2014","accessionNumber":"14210074","dateOfInsertion":"04 April 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MIMO Radar Transmit Beampattern Design Without Synthesising the Covariance Matrix","sourcePdf":"tsp-ahmed-2310435-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.083969S","chronDate":"May1,  2014","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"6782402","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"64","xplore-issue":"6782402","articleId":"6766711","onlineDate":"13 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6766715,"authors":[{"name":"Sachin Patil","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of California, Berkeley, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8860/6869067/6766715/6766715-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Sachin Patil (M\u201914) received the B.Tech degree in computer science and engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay, India, in 2006 and the Ph.D degree in computer science from the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC, USA, in 2012.","He is currently a Postdoctoral Researcher with the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of California, Berkeley, CA, USA.

We present a new needle steering system capable of automatically reaching targets in 3-D environments while avoiding obstacles and compensating for real-world uncertainties. Given a specification of anatomical obstacles and a clinical target (e.g., from preoperative medical images), our system plans and controls needle motion in a closed-loop fashion under sensory feedback to optimize a clinical metric. We unify planning and control using a new fast algorithm that continuously replans the needle motion. Our rapid replanning approach is enabled by an efficient sampling-based rapidly exploring random tree (RRT) planner that achieves orders-of-magnitude reduction in computation time compared with prior 3-D approaches by incorporating variable curvature kinematics and a novel distance metric for planning. Our system uses an electromagnetic tracking system to sense the state of the needle tip during the procedure. We experimentally evaluate our needle steering system using tissue phantoms and animal tissue ex vivo. We demonstrate that our rapid replanning strategy successfully guides the needle around obstacles to desired 3-D targets with an average error of less than 3 mm.","doi":"10.1109/TRO.2014.2307633","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics","pdfPath":"/iel7/8860/6869067/06766715.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TRO.2014.2307633","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6869067","startPage":"853","endPage":"864","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Needle Steering in 3-D Via Rapid Replanning","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6766715","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Needle Steering in 3-D Via Rapid Replanning","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6766715/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 March 2014","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"30","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Aug. 2014","accessionNumber":"14501240","pubMedId":"25435829","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","htmlLink":"/document/6766715/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000002","fundingName":"National Institutes of Health","grantNumber":"R21EB011628"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"IIS-0905344 and IIS-1149965"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Needle Steering in 3-D Via Rapid Replanning","sourcePdf":"tro-patil-2307633-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.112882S","chronDate":"Aug.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"8860","isNumber":"6869067","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8860","citationCount":"82","xplore-issue":"6869067","articleId":"6766715","onlineDate":"13 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-22"},{"_id":6766728,"authors":[{"name":"Feng Li","affiliation":["Department of Information and Communication Engineering, Xian Jiaotong University, Shaanxi, China"],"firstName":"Feng","lastName":"Li","id":"38187655300"},{"name":"Zongben Xu","affiliation":["Institute for Information and System Sciences, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Shaanxi, China"],"firstName":"Zongben","lastName":"Xu","id":"37086192342"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1070-9908"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2361"}],"articleNumber":"6766728","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":853},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sensors","Vectors","Bayes methods","Niobium","Signal processing algorithms","Estimation","Cognitive radio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["belief networks","cognitive radio","cooperative communication","learning (artificial intelligence)","message passing","network theory (graphs)","radio spectrum management","signal representation","spectral analysis","variational techniques"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sparse Bayesian hierarchical prior modeling","cooperative spectrum sensing","wideband cognitive radio network","sparse Bayesian learning","penalization","factor graph","signal model representation","variational message passing","VMP algorithm","power spectral density","PSD map"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Bayesian hierarchical model","cognitive radio","compressive sensing","cooperative spectrum sensing","sparse estimation","variational message passing"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sparse Bayesian Hierarchical Prior Modeling Based Cooperative Spectrum Sensing in Wideband Cognitive Radio Networks","doi":"10.1109/LSP.2014.2311902","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6750780","endPage":"590","publicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/97/6750780/06766728.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LSP.2014.2311902","startPage":"586","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6766728","abstract":"This letter proposes a new method for cooperative spectrum sensing by exploiting sparsity.

Their inclusion in communication standards requires to define decoders able to support efficiently a set of codes with different code length, code rates or code structures. In addition to this high flexibility, these decoders still have to achieve high throughputs in order to comply with standards requirements. In this paper, we propose to address the problem of designing generic and efficient LDPC decoders by using a nonsymmetric NISC-based architecture that performs layered decoding. NISC architectures provide flexibility with a limited loss in hardware efficiency. In addition, an automated design flow is used to efficiently assign computations to the processing units (PU) and to map data to the memory units (MU). Unlike previous works, the NISC decoder can include a number of PUs that is different than the number of MUs. This nonsymmetric characteristic provides a higher degree of freedom during the computation/data assignment phase of the design flow. This whole design framework automatically generates an LDPC decoder able to support any set of predetermined LDPC codes regardless of their parameters. The automated nature of the design framework enables to easily explore the design space for a given set of codes. Compared to state of the art LDPC decoders, the automatically generated decoders achieve higher hardware efficiency even for the challenging-to-implement unstructured LDPC codes.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2014.2311964","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/78/6803925/06766729.pdf","startPage":"2469","endPage":"2479","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6803925","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2014.2311964","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Flexible NISC-Based LDPC Decoder","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6766729","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"May15,  2014","displayDocTitle":"A Flexible NISC-Based LDPC Decoder","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6766729/","publicationDate":"May15, 2014","dateOfInsertion":"25 April 2014","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"14264380","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6766729/","volume":"62","issue":"10","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 March 2014","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Flexible NISC-Based LDPC Decoder","sourcePdf":"tsp-legal-2311964-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.139921S","chronDate":"May15,  2014","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"6803925","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"6803925","articleId":"6766729","onlineDate":"13 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6766731,"authors":[{"name":"Vincent Roberge","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, Royal Military College of Canada, Kingston, ON, Canada"],"firstName":"Vincent","lastName":"Roberge","id":"38540497300"},{"name":"Mohammed Tarbouchi","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, Royal Military College of Canada, Kingston, ON, Canada"],"firstName":"Mohammed","lastName":"Tarbouchi","id":"37323626700"},{"name":"Francis Okou","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, Royal Military College of Canada, Kingston, ON, Canada"],"firstName":"Francis","lastName":"Okou","id":"37282825300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0885-8993"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0107"}],"articleNumber":"6766731","dbTime":"16 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":44,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1485},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Power Electronics Society","url":"http://www.ieee-pels.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Harmonic analysis","Inverters","Graphics processing units","Genetic algorithms","Switches","Minimization","Modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","graphics processing units","harmonics suppression","heuristic programming","invertors","mathematics computing","parallel algorithms","power engineering computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["harmonic minimization","multilevel inverters","parallel genetic algorithm","graphical processing unit","high-power inverters","low switching losses","low electromagnetic interference","GA","optimal switching angles","metaheuristics algorithm","dc sources","real-time control","GPU","total harmonic distortion","parallel architecture","CPU","time 164 ms"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Genetic algorithm (GA)","graphical processing unit (GPU)","multilevel inverter","parallel algorithm"]}],"abstract":"Multilevel inverters form a popular class of high-power inverters due to their high-voltage operation, high efficiency, low switching losses, and low electromagnetic interference. Metaheuristics, such as the genetic algorithm (GA), have been used with success to compute optimal switching angles for multilevel inverters with many dc sources while minimizing several harmonics. However, these methods are computationally demanding and cannot easily be used for real-time control. In this letter, a parallel implementation of the GA on graphical processing unit (GPU) is proposed in order to accelerate the computation of the optimal switching angles for multilevel inverters with varying dc sources. Four approaches to parallelize and speed up the computation of the total harmonic distortion are presented and compared. By exploiting the massively parallel architecture of GPUs, the computation of optimal angles is accelerated by a factor of 469\u00d7 compared to a sequential execution on CPU.

The new machines have some advantages: lower subharmonics of air-gap flux density and magnetomotive force and lower machine losses, including eddy current losses. The machines have been adapted for self-sensing applications by using a high-frequency (HF) injection method. The main machine parameters affecting the estimation accuracy are analyzed such as fundamental frequency saliencies, cross saturation, HF inductance, HF resistance, and harmonic distortion due to multisaliencies. The experimental results verify that the novel machines can reach very high performance with good self-sensing properties regarding the accuracy of the estimated position/speed of electric drives even without the multisaliency decoupling compensation method.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","pdfPath":"/iel7/28/6899725/06766732.pdf","startPage":"3325","endPage":"3334","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","doi":"10.1109/TIA.2014.2311507","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIA.2014.2311507","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6899725","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6766732","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Position Self-Sensing Evaluation of Novel CW-IPMSMs With an HF Injection Method","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Windings","Hafnium","Harmonic analysis","Stator windings","Inductance","Rotors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electric drives","machine windings","permanent magnet machines","synchronous machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["position self-sensing evaluation","CW-IPMSM","HF injection method","interior permanent-magnet synchronous machines","concentrated windings","self-sensing control system","air-gap flux density subharmonics","magnetomotive force","machine loss","eddy current loss","high-frequency injection method","machine parameters","estimation accuracy","fundamental frequency saliencies","cross saturation","HF inductance","HF resistance","harmonic distortion","self-sensing properties","electric drive position estimation","electric drive speed estimation"]},{"kwd":["Finite-element methods (FEMs)","high-frequency (HF) injection","interior permanent-magnet synchronous machines (IPMSMs)","multisaliencies","self-sensing","sensorless control"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6766732/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.-Oct.  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 March 2014","displayDocTitle":"Position Self-Sensing Evaluation of Novel CW-IPMSMs With an HF Injection Method","volume":"50","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/6766732/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept.-Oct. 2014","accessionNumber":"14597743","dateOfInsertion":"16 September 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004543","fundingName":"China Scholarship Council"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Position Self-Sensing Evaluation of Novel CW-IPMSMs With an HF Injection Method","sourcePdf":"tia-wang-2311507-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.088686S","chronDate":"Sept.-Oct.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"28","isNumber":"6899725","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"28","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"6899725","articleId":"6766732","onlineDate":"13 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6766739,"authors":[{"name":"Nam Yul Yu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Lakehead University, Thunder Bay, ON, Canada"],"firstName":"Nam Yul","lastName":"Yu","id":"37286525900"},{"name":"Lu Gan","affiliation":["School of Engineering and Design, Brunel University, Uxbridge, UK"],"firstName":"Lu","lastName":"Gan","id":"37266507000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1070-9908"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2361"}],"articleNumber":"6766739","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":500},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"abstract":"In many applications of compressed sensing, the data acquisition involves convolution by a filter followed by subsampling.

Gradient projection is used to solve a constrained nonconvex SOONE function minimization problem and recover the sparse signal. However, while the gradient projection method is computationally simple, it is not robust when a matrix in the algorithm is ill conditioned. We thus further propose using diagonal loading and singular value decomposition methods to improve the robustness of the algorithm. In order to handle targets with large flat surfaces, a combined amplitude and total-variation objective function is also proposed to regularize the shapes of the flat surfaces.

When these products include sophisticated electronics encased in 3D packaging with complex geometries and intricate detail, TTM can be compromised - resulting in lost opportunity. The use of advanced 3D printing technology enhanced with component placement and electrical interconnect deposition can provide electronic prototypes that now can be rapidly fabricated in comparable time frames as traditional 2D bread-boarded prototypes; however, these 3D prototypes include the advantage of being embedded within more appropriate shapes in order to authentically prototype products earlier in the development cycle. The fabrication freedom offered by 3D printing techniques, such as stereolithography and fused deposition modeling have recently been explored in the context of 3D electronics integration - referred to as 3D structural electronics or 3D printed electronics. Enhanced 3D printing may eventually be employed to manufacture end-use parts and thus offer unit-level customization with local manufacturing; however, until the materials and dimensional accuracies improve (an eventuality), 3D printing technologies can be employed to reduce development times by providing advanced geometrically appropriate electronic prototypes. This paper describes the development process used to design a novelty six-sided gaming die. The die includes a microprocessor and accelerometer, which together detect motion and upon halting, identify the top surface through gravity and illuminate light-emitting diodes for a striking effect. By applying 3D printing of structural electronics to expedite prototyping, the development cycle was reduced from weeks to hours.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/6705689/06766751.pdf","startPage":"234","endPage":"242","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2014.2311810","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2014.2311810","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6705689","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6766751","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"3D Printing for the Rapid Prototyping of Structural Electronics","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Product development","Three dimensional displays","Printing","Product life cycle management","Economics","Consumer electronics","Time to market","Prototypes","Packaging"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["accelerometers","electronics packaging","light emitting diodes","microprocessor chips","rapid prototyping (industrial)","stereolithography","three-dimensional integrated circuits","three-dimensional printing","time to market"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3D printing","rapid prototyping","time to market","TTM","3D packaging","electrical interconnect deposition","2D bread boarded prototypes","stereolithography","fused deposition modeling","3D electronics integration","3D structural electronics","3D printed electronics","six sided gaming die","microprocessor","accelerometer","light emitting diodes"]},{"kwd":["3D printed electronics","additive manufacturing","direct-print","electronic gaming die","hybrid manufacturing","rapid prototyping","structural electronics","three-dimensional electronics"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6766751/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 March 2014","displayDocTitle":"3D Printing for the Rapid Prototyping of Structural Electronics","volume":"2","htmlLink":"/document/6766751/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2014","accessionNumber":"14219280","dateOfInsertion":"09 April 2014","isOpenAccess":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"3D Printing for the Rapid Prototyping of Structural Electronics","sourcePdf":"access-perez-2311810-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.058851S","chronDate":"Dec.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"6705689","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"321","xplore-issue":"6705689","articleId":"6766751","onlineDate":"13 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-20"},{"_id":6766752,"authors":[{"name":"Xingyi Zhang","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Intelligent Computing and Signal Processing of Ministry of Education, School of Computer Science and Technology, Anhui University, Hefei, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4235/7070844/6766752/zhang-2308305-small.gif","p":["Xingyi Zhang received the B.Sc. degree from Fuyang Normal College, Fuyang, China, in 2003 and the M.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees in 2006 and 2009, respectively, from Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.","He is an Associate Professor with the School of Computer Science and Technology, Anhui University, Hefei, China.

This technique, however, can be computationally expensive, especially when the number of individuals in the population becomes large. This is mainly because in most existing nondominated sorting algorithms, a solution needs to be compared with all other solutions before it can be assigned to a front. In this paper we propose a novel, computationally efficient approach to nondominated sorting, termed efficient nondominated sort (ENS). In ENS, a solution to be assigned to a front needs to be compared only with those that have already been assigned to a front, thereby avoiding many unnecessary dominance comparisons. Based on this new approach, two nondominated sorting algorithms have been suggested. Both theoretical analysis and empirical results show that the ENS-based sorting algorithms are computationally more efficient than the state-of-the-art nondominated sorting methods.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6766752/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 March 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2015","volume":"19","issue":"2","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15019519","dateOfInsertion":"27 March 2015","publicationDate":"April 2015","htmlLink":"/document/6766752/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"An Efficient Approach to Nondominated Sorting for Evolutionary Multiobjective Optimization","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61272152, 61033003, 91130034, 61373066, 61073116, 61003131 and 61202011"},{"fundingName":"Ph.D. Programs Foundation, Ministry of Education of China","grantNumber":"20100142110072"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"2010ZD001"},{"fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Anhui Higher Education Institutions of China","grantNumber":"KJ2012A010 and KJ2013A007"},{"fundingName":"Scientific Research Foundation for Doctor of Anhui University","grantNumber":"02203104"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Efficient Approach to Nondominated Sorting for Evolutionary Multiobjective Optimization","sourcePdf":"tevc-jin-2308305-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.122115S","chronDate":"April  2015","xplore-pub-id":"4235","isNumber":"7070844","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4235","citationCount":"253","xplore-issue":"7070844","articleId":"6766752","onlineDate":"13 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6766762,"authors":[{"name":"Clement Kam","affiliation":["Naval Research Laboratory, Washington, DC, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6509490/6837540/6766762/6766762-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Clement Kam (S\u201905\u2013M\u201911) received the B.S. degree in electrical and computer engineering from Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, USA, in 2001, and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from the University of California, San Diego, CA, USA, in 2006 and 2010, respectively.","He is currently at the Naval Research Laboratory, Washington, DC.

We study the impact of network-level cooperation, in which one of the nodes can relay the packets of the other user that are not received at the destinations. Under this approach, if a packet transmitted by the primary user is not successfully received by the destination set but is captured by the secondary source, then the secondary user assumes responsibility for completing the transmission of the packet; therefore, the primary releases it from its queue, enabling it to process the next packet. We demonstrate that the stability and throughput regions of this cooperative approach is larger than that of the noncooperative approach, which translates into a benefit for both users of this multicast system. Our system model allows for the possibility of multipacket reception (MPR), and the optimal transmission strategies for different levels of MPR capability are observed in our numerical results. In addition to achieving a larger stability region, our results show that cooperation can result in reduced average delay for both primary and secondary users.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Control of Network Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Control of Network Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/6509490/6837540/06766762.pdf","startPage":"135","endPage":"144","doi":"10.1109/TCNS.2014.2311651","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCNS.2014.2311651","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6837540","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cognitive Cooperative Random Access for Multicast: Stability and Throughput Analysis","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6766762/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 March 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2014","displayDocTitle":"Cognitive Cooperative Random Access for Multicast: Stability and Throughput Analysis","htmlLink":"/document/6766762/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2014","dateOfInsertion":"18 June 2014","accessionNumber":"14396454","isJournal":true,"volume":"1","issue":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cognitive Cooperative Random Access for Multicast: Stability and Throughput Analysis","sourcePdf":"tcns-kam-2311651-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.089234S","chronDate":"June  2014","xplore-pub-id":"6509490","isNumber":"6837540","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6509490","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6837540","articleId":"6766762","onlineDate":"13 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6766772,"authors":[{"name":"Jui-Han Lu","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Communication Engineering, National Kaohsiung Marine University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan, R.O.C."],"firstName":"Jui-Han","lastName":"Lu","id":"37278637000"},{"name":"Jia-Ling Guo","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Communication Engineering, National Kaohsiung Marine University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan, R.O.C."],"firstName":"Jia-Ling","lastName":"Guo","id":"37086137681"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1536-1225"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1548-5757"}],"articleNumber":"6766772","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":35,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2352},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society","url":"http://www.ieeeaps.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Mobile handsets","Mobile antennas","Antenna measurements","Long Term Evolution","Bandwidth"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Long Term Evolution","microstrip antennas","mobile handsets","monopole antennas","wide area networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["printed monopole antenna","impedance bandwidths","C-shaped ground plane","parasitic shorted strip","multiband WWAN-LTE operation","small-size printed antenna","LTE-WWAN mobile phone","small size Octaband monopole antenna","bandwidth 277 MHz","bandwidth 1176 MHz","gain 2.2 dB","gain 3.1 dB"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["LTE","monopole antenna","shorted strip","specific absorption rate (SAR)"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6766772","abstract":"This letter proposes a small-size printed antenna with multiband WWAN/LTE operation in a mobile phone by introducing a novel loop parasitic shorted strip and a C-shaped ground plane.

In this paper, we focus on communicating reliably over an additive white Gaussian noise channel using such an energy harvesting sensor node. An important part of this paper involves appropriate modeling of energy harvesting, as done via various practical architectures. Our main result is the characterization of the Shannon capacity of the communication system. The key technical challenge involves dealing with the dynamic (and stochastic) nature of the (quadratic) cost of the input to the channel. As a corollary, we find close connections between the capacity achieving energy management policies and the queueing theoretic throughput optimal policies.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Capacity of Gaussian Channels With Energy Harvesting and Processing Cost","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2014.2311822","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel7/18/6800061/06766774.pdf","startPage":"2563","endPage":"2575","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2014.2311822","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6800061","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6766774","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6766774/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 March 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2014","displayDocTitle":"Capacity of Gaussian Channels With Energy Harvesting and Processing Cost","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"60","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/6766774/","dateOfInsertion":"18 April 2014","publicationDate":"May 2014","accessionNumber":"14238990","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Capacity of Gaussian Channels With Energy Harvesting and Processing Cost","sourcePdf":"tit-ramachandran-2311822-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.133275S","chronDate":"May  2014","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"6800061","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"56","xplore-issue":"6800061","articleId":"6766774","onlineDate":"13 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6766781,"authors":[{"name":"Ching-Wei Yang","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering, Institute of ElectronicsN, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/16/6776447/6766781/6766781-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ching-Wei Yang received the B.S. degree from the Electrical Engineering and Computer Science Undergraduate Honors Program, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan, and the M.S. degree from the Department of Electronic Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, in 2011 and 2013, respectively."]},"firstName":"Ching-Wei","lastName":"Yang","id":"37077593800"},{"name":"Pin Su","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering, Institute of ElectronicsN, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/16/6776447/6766781/6766781-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Pin Su (S'98-M'02) received the Ph.D. degree from the University of California at Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA.

Typically, ADAC systems assume operation on well-focused SAS images. However, in practice, residual motion errors or other errors, e.g., a mismatch in the wave propagation speed, may still be present, leading to a degradation in the quality of SAS images. Consequently, it is of major interest to study the detection and classification behavior of an automatic system under the influence of residual motion and phase errors. First, we train our ADAC system using a database of well-focused SAS images. Subsequently, we use real sonar measurements from different sea trials to build a test database of SAS images where motion errors and sound-speed mismatches are artificially induced into the image reconstruction process to study the impact on segmentation, feature extraction, and classification rate. A relation between the image degradation and the individual tasks of the ADAC system is empirically demonstrated by assessing the image quality using a full-reference method. The obtained results illustrate a severe dependency of the ADAC system performance on the SAS image quality. At the same time, the results highlight the need for both image quality assessment schemes and robust segmentation and feature selection techniques, to improve the reliability of SAS-based target recognition systems under difficult conditions.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6766807/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 March 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"40","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2015","accessionNumber":"14863998","htmlLink":"/document/6766807/","displayDocTitle":"Motion Error Influence on Segmentation and Classification Performance in SAS-Based Automatic Mine Countermeasures","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Motion Error Influence on Segmentation and Classification Performance in SAS-Based Automatic Mine Countermeasures","sourcePdf":"joe-leier-2303718-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.104552S","chronDate":"Jan.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"48","isNumber":"7005546","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"48","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7005546","articleId":"6766807","onlineDate":"13 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6766880,"authors":[{"name":"John M.

This article summarizes the experimental results on power smoothing of in-motion wireless EV charging performed at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) using various combinations of electrochemical capacitors at the grid side and in the vehicle. Electrochemical capacitors of the symmetric carbon-carbon type from Maxwell Technologies comprised the in-vehicle smoothing of wireless charging current to the EV battery pack. Electro Standards Laboratories (ESL) fabricated the passive and active parallel lithium-capacitor (LiC) unit used to smooth the grid-side power. The power pulsation reduction was 81% on the grid by the LiC, and 84% on the vehicle for both the LiC and the carbon ultracapacitors (UCs).","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6766880/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 March 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2014","volume":"1","issue":"1","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"14180872","dateOfInsertion":"17 March 2014","publicationDate":"March 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6766880/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Demonstrating Dynamic Wireless Charging of an Electric Vehicle: The Benefit of Electrochemical Capacitor Smoothing","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Demonstrating Dynamic Wireless Charging of an Electric Vehicle: The Benefit of Electrochemical Capacitor Smoothing","sourcePdf":"01mpel01-miller-2300978-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.128416S","chronDate":"March  2014","xplore-pub-id":"6570649","isNumber":"6766838","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6570649","citationCount":"156","xplore-issue":"6766838","articleId":"6766880","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-23"},{"_id":6766881,"authors":[{"name":"Daniel P.

The beamformer weights usually depend on the statistics of the noise and desired speech signals, which cannot be directly observed and must be estimated. Estimators based on the speech presence probability (SPP) seek to update the statistics estimates only when desired speech is known to be absent or present. However, they do not normally distinguish between desired and undesired speech sources. In this contribution, an algorithm is proposed to distinguish between these two types of sources using additional spatial information, by estimating a desired speech presence probability based on the combination of a multichannel SPP and a direction of arrival (DOA) based probability. The DOA-based probability is computed using DOA estimates for each time-frequency bin. The estimated statistics are then used to compute the weights of a spherical harmonic domain tradeoff beamformer, which achieves a balance between noise reduction and speech distortion. The performance evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach at suppressing both background noise and spatially coherent noise. A number of audio examples and sample spectrograms are also provided.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TASLP.2014.2311925","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6781022","startPage":"967","endPage":"978","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/6570655/6781022/06766881.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Noise Reduction in the Spherical Harmonic Domain Using a Tradeoff Beamformer and Narrowband DOA Estimates","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6766881/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 March 2014","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Noise Reduction in the Spherical Harmonic Domain Using a Tradeoff Beamformer and Narrowband DOA Estimates","publicationDate":"May 2014","accessionNumber":"14263769","dateOfInsertion":"24 April 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"22","issue":"5","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Noise Reduction in the Spherical Harmonic Domain Using a Tradeoff Beamformer and Narrowband DOA Estimates","sourcePdf":"taslp-jarrett-2311925-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.098126S","chronDate":"May  2014","isNumber":"6781022","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6570655","citationCount":"10","articleId":"6766881","onlineDate":"13 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6766918,"authors":[{"name":"Kevin Mets","affiliation":["Dept. of Information Technology - IBCN, Ghent University - iMinds, Ghent, Belgium"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/9739/6880447/6766918/6766918-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Kevin Mets received the M.Sc. degree in Computer Science from Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium, in 2009.

First, we discuss the motivation for the development of smart grid simulators, as well as their associated research questions and design challenges. Next, we discuss three types of simulators in the smart grid area: power system simulators, communication network simulators, and combined power and communication simulators. To summarize the findings from this survey, we classify the different simulators according to targeted use cases, simulation model level of detail, and architecture. To conclude, we discuss the use of standards and multi-agent based modeling in smart grid simulation.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6766918/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Third Quarter  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 March 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"16","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Third Quarter 2014","dateOfInsertion":"19 August 2014","accessionNumber":"14527954","htmlLink":"/document/6766918/","displayDocTitle":"Combining Power and Communication Network Simulation for Cost-Effective Smart Grid Analysis","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Combining Power and Communication Network Simulation for Cost-Effective Smart Grid Analysis","sourcePdf":"29Mets116.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.157706S","chronDate":"Third Quarter  2014","xplore-pub-id":"9739","isNumber":"6880447","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9739","citationCount":"149","xplore-issue":"6880447","articleId":"6766918","onlineDate":"14 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6766919,"authors":[{"name":"Geoffrey Y.

Clipped error control is the most important algorithm for power saving during backlight dimming. The proposed segmentation-based clipped error control algorithm considers the exact local distribution of an image using image segmentation, which enhances the image quality compared with existing methods. In addition, a binary search algorithm is applied to the proposed method for reducing the computational complexity. The experimental results showed that the average peak signal-to-noise ratio with the proposed method was up to 11.734 dB higher than those of conventional methods whereas the power consumption increased only slightly.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["PSNR","Image quality","Image segmentation","Power demand","Error correction","Brightness","Histograms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","energy conservation","image segmentation","liquid crystal displays","search problems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["segmentation-based clipped error control algorithm","global backlight dimming","liquid crystal displays","power saving","image segmentation","image quality enhancement","binary search algorithm","computational complexity reduction","peak signal-to-noise ratio"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Backlight dimming","backlight scaling","liquid crystal display (LCD)","lower power technique"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6767052","doi":"10.1109/JDT.2014.2311820","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Display Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/9425/6819099/06767052.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JDT.2014.2311820","startPage":"568","endPage":"573","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6819099","publicationTitle":"Journal of Display Technology","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Segmentation-Based Clipped Error Control Algorithm for Global Backlight Dimming","pubTopics":[{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Segmentation-Based Clipped Error Control Algorithm for Global Backlight Dimming","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6767052/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 March 2014","volume":"10","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/6767052/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","publicationDate":"July 2014","accessionNumber":"14348189","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Segmentation-Based Clipped Error Control Algorithm for Global Backlight Dimming","sourcePdf":"jdt-kang-2311820-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.056453S","chronDate":"July  2014","xplore-pub-id":"9425","isNumber":"6819099","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9425","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"6819099","articleId":"6767052","onlineDate":"14 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6767055,"authors":[{"name":"Jes\u00fas Alberto Meda-Campa\u00f1a","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering of Secci\u00f3n de Estudios de Posgrado e Investigaci\u00f3n de la Escuela Superior de Ingenier\u00eda Mec\u00e1nica y El\u00e9ctrica, Campus Zacatenco del Instituto Polit\u00e9cnico Nacional, M\u00e9xico, DF, Mexico"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/91/7070767/6767055/6767055-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jes\u00fas Alberto Meda-Campa\u00f1a was born in Culiac\u00e1n, Sinaloa, M\u00e9xico, in 1971.

As the semiconducting gas sensing thin film on top of micromachined platforms often needs an elevated temperature to activate the sensing mechanism, the suitable electrothermal and structural design of a microheater, i.e., having fast response, uniform temperature distribution over sensing area, and minimal residual/thermal-stress-induced membrane deflection, are of prime concern. In this paper, the technological developments related to the various designs and geometries of microheaters and their fabrication technology employing different suitable heating materials, for closed- and suspended-type silicon membranes have been discussed critically with particular emphasis on the relative merits and demerits with reference to heater parameters such as power consumption, temperature distribution, response time, and mechanical stability/reliability.","doi":"10.1109/TDMR.2014.2311801","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6824879","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TDMR.2014.2311801","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Device and Materials Reliability","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Device and Materials Reliability","pdfPath":"/iel7/7298/6824879/06767061.pdf","startPage":"589","endPage":"599","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Technological Journey Towards Reliable Microheater Development for MEMS Gas Sensors: A Review","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 March 2014","displayDocTitle":"Technological Journey Towards Reliable Microheater Development for MEMS Gas Sensors: A Review","volume":"14","issue":"2","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2014","dateOfInsertion":"03 June 2014","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6767061/","publicationDate":"June 2014","accessionNumber":"14349436","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6767061/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"CSIR"},{"fundingName":"Department of Science and Technology (DST)"},{"fundingName":"Indian National Science Academy"},{"fundingName":"AICTE Career Award Young Teachers"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Technological Journey Towards Reliable Microheater Development for MEMS Gas Sensors: A Review","sourcePdf":"tdmr-bhattacharyya-2311801-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.190069S","chronDate":"June  2014","xplore-pub-id":"7298","isNumber":"6824879","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7298","citationCount":"53","xplore-issue":"6824879","articleId":"6767061","onlineDate":"14 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6767066,"authors":[{"name":"Mingjian Li","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Millimeter Waves, City University of Hong Kong,, Kowloon Tong, Hong Kong"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8/6823189/6767066/6767066-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Mingjian Li (S'10) received the B.Sc.

The monotone cubic Hermite spline interpolation (CHSI) technique by Fritsch and Carlson is employed to design paths that provide the user with better shape control and avoid wiggles and zigzags between the two successive waypoints. The conventional line-of-sight (LOS) guidance law is modified by proposing a time-varying equation for the lookahead distance, which is a function of the cross-track error. This results in a more flexible maneuvering behavior that can contribute to reaching the desired path faster as well as obtaining a diminished oscillatory behavior around the desired path. The guidance system along with a heading controller form a cascaded structure, which is shown to be \u03ba-exponentially stable when the control task is to converge to the path produced by the aforementioned CHSI method. In addition, the issue of compensating for the sideslip angle \u03b2 is discussed and a new \u03ba-exponentially stable integral LOS guidance law, capable of eliminating the effect of constant external disturbances for straight-line path following, is derived.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Control Systems

optimum decisions, which are made on the basis of the collected context information. This paper focuses on optimization algorithms for decision making to optimize radio resource usage in heterogeneous cognitive wireless networks. For networks with centralized management, we proposed a novel optimization algorithm whose solution is guaranteed to be exactly optimal. In order to avoid an exponential increase of computational complexity in large-scale wireless networks, we model the target optimization problem as a minimum cost-flow problem and find the solution of the problem in polynomial time. For the networks with decentralized management, we propose a distributed algorithm using the distributed energy minimization dynamics of the Hopfield-Tank neural network. Our algorithm minimizes a given objective function without any centralized calculation. We derive the decision-making rule for each terminal to optimize the entire network. We demonstrate the validity of the proposed algorithms by several numerical simulations and the feasibility of the proposed schemes by designing and implementing them on experimental cognitive radio network systems.","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and

Results show that the large hexagonal crystal grains have been eliminated, thus the resistance distributions have been greatly improved after preprogramming.","doi":"10.1109/LED.2014.2308909","publicationTitle":"IEEE Electron Device Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Electron Device Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/55/6803890/06767089.pdf","startPage":"536","endPage":"538","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LED.2014.2308909","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6803890","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"RESET Distribution Improvement of Phase Change Memory: The Impact of Pre-Programming","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6767089/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 March 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2014","displayDocTitle":"RESET Distribution Improvement of Phase Change Memory: The Impact of Pre-Programming","volume":"35","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 2014","accessionNumber":"14252091","htmlLink":"/document/6767089/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"23 April 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"RESET Distribution Improvement of Phase Change Memory: The Impact of Pre-Programming","sourcePdf":"led-wang-2308909-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.061493S","chronDate":"May  2014","xplore-pub-id":"55","isNumber":"6803890","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"55","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"6803890","articleId":"6767089","onlineDate":"14 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6767091,"authors":[{"name":"Tong Wang","affiliation":["Research Institute of Intelligent Control and Systems, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/91/7070767/6767091/6767091-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Tong Wang received the B.S. degree in information and computing sciences from Shanxi University, Taiyuan, China, in 2010 and the M.S. degree in control theory and control engineering from Liaoning University of Technology, Jinzhou, China, in 2013.

The primary components of the system include a wireless capsule, a portable data recorder, and a workstation. Temperature, pH, and pressure sensors; an RF transceiver; a controlling and processing application specific integrated circuit (ASIC); and batteries were applied in a wireless capsule. Decreasing capsule size, improving sensor precision, and reducing power needs were the primary challenges; these were resolved by employing micro sensors, optimized architecture, and an ASIC design that include power management, clock management, a programmable gain amplifier (PGA), an A/D converter (ADC), and a serial peripheral interface (SPI) communication unit. The ASIC has been fabricated in 0.18- \u03bcm CMOS technology with a die area of 5.0 mm \u00d7 5.0 mm. The wireless capsule integrating the ASIC controller measures \u03a6 11 mm \u00d7 26 mm. A data recorder and a workstation were developed, and 20 cases of human experiments were conducted in hospitals. Preprocessing in the workstation can significantly improve the quality of the data, and 76 original features were determined by mathematical statistics. Based on the 13 optimal features achieved in the evaluation of the features, the clustering algorithm can identify the patients who lack GI motility with a recognition rate reaching

However, the impact of Femtocells on the performance of the conventional Macrocell system leads interference problem between Femtocells and pre-existing Macrocells as they share the same licensed frequency spectrum. In this paper, we propose an efficient method to mitigate interference and improve system capacity in the existing Femto-Macro two tier networks. In our proposed scheme, we use a novel frequency planning for two tiers cellular networks using frequency reuse technique where Macro base stations allocate frequency sub-bands for Femtocells users on demand basis through Femtocells base stations. This novel frequency reuse technique aims to mitigate interference by improving system throughput.","doi":"10.1109/FGCT.2013.6767182","publicationTitle":"Second International Conference on Future Generation Communication Technologies (FGCT 2013)","displayPublicationTitle":"Second International Conference on Future Generation Communication Technologies (FGCT 2013)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6766332/6767177/06767182.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FGCT.2013.6767182","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6767177","startPage":"213","endPage":"218","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On demand-based frequency allocation to mitigate interference in Femto-Macro LTE cellular network","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6767182","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"On demand-based frequency allocation to mitigate interference in Femto-Macro LTE cellular network","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Nov. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6767182/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"12-14 Nov. 2013","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2013","accessionNumber":"14180766","dateOfInsertion":"17 March 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6767182/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On demand-based frequency allocation to mitigate interference in Femto-Macro LTE cellular network","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"105.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047294S","chronDate":"12-14 Nov. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6766332","isNumber":"6767177","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6766332","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6767177","articleId":"6767182","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6767183,"authors":[{"name":"Syed Imran Ali","affiliation":["Computer & Information Technology Department, King Fahd University of Petroleum & Minerals, Dhahran, Saudi Arabia"],"firstName":"Syed Imran","lastName":"Ali","id":"37086793212"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2975-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-2974-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2377-262X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2377-2638"}],"articleNumber":"6767183","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":778},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cloud computing","Manufacturing industries","Computers","Computational modeling","Companies","Supply chains"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","innovation management","manufacturing industries","next generation networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","manufacturing industry supply chains","next-generation architecture","business world","cloud market","traditional business model","product innovation","factory networks"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cloud Computing","Supply Chain Performance","Manufacturing indutsry","Cloud computing technology(CCT)","Adoption"]}],"abstract":"Cloud computing technology which is next-generation architecture has created hype in IT and business world promising to deliver wide range of benefits.

At vehicular speed performing spectrum optimization and then spectrum mobility is a challenging chore. Spectrum mobility is very frequent in IVC due to extreme mobile nature of vehicles and unpredictable RF channel. A proficient white space optimization technique is a basic requirement to perform in time spectrum decision and so in time spectrum mobility. Genetic Algorithm (GA) is considered as one of the best optimization techniques for white space optimization. But at vehicular speed simple genetic algorithm (GA) has been botched to perform white space optimization in real time. To anticipate this problem we have already proposed Memory enabled genetic algorithm (MEGA) in our previous work. In this research work we have further improved the convergence time of MEGA by manipulating the generation gap and mutation operator. Simulation results have proven that enhanced memory enabled genetic algorithm (EMEGA) is 0.522 ms faster than MEGA. In the next phase of research an efficient spectrum mobility scheme using human emotion (fear) has been proposed. Simulation results reveal that using our proposed spectrum decision and spectrum mobility schemes a more efficient cognitive radio based vehicular networks can be tailored.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FGCT.2013.6767195","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6767177","startPage":"190","endPage":"195","displayPublicationTitle":"Second International Conference on Future Generation Communication Technologies (FGCT 2013)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6766332/6767177/06767195.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient spectrum optimization and mobility in cognitive radio based inter-vehicle communcation system","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6767195/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Nov. 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6767195/","displayDocTitle":"Efficient spectrum optimization and mobility in cognitive radio based inter-vehicle communcation system","conferenceDate":"12-14 Nov. 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2013","accessionNumber":"14162159","dateOfInsertion":"17 March 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient spectrum optimization and mobility in cognitive radio based inter-vehicle communcation system","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"44.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.130947S","chronDate":"12-14 Nov. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6766332","isNumber":"6767177","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6766332","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6767177","articleId":"6767195","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6767196,"authors":[{"name":"Peng Zhangyou","affiliation":["School of Communication and Information Engineering, Shanghai University, Shanghai, P.

Lastly, the pilot expansion technique can also help to reveal the initial channel variation and its Doppler rate which can be subsequently applied to the projection model in the Kalman filter for updating and tracking the MIMO channel in real-time with decision feedback during the actual data payload.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MIMO channel estimation and tracking using a novel pilot expansion technique with Paley-Hadamard codes for future generation fast speed communications","publicationTitle":"Second International Conference on Future Generation Communication Technologies (FGCT 2013)","doi":"10.1109/FGCT.2013.6767210","displayPublicationTitle":"Second International Conference on Future Generation Communication Technologies (FGCT 2013)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6766332/6767177/06767210.pdf","startPage":"48","endPage":"53","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FGCT.2013.6767210","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6767177","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6767210","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6767210/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Nov. 2013","displayDocTitle":"MIMO channel estimation and tracking using a novel pilot expansion technique with Paley-Hadamard codes for future generation fast speed communications","conferenceDate":"12-14 Nov. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6767210/","dateOfInsertion":"17 March 2014","publicationDate":"Nov. 2013","accessionNumber":"14162161","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MIMO channel estimation and tracking using a novel pilot expansion technique with Paley-Hadamard codes for future generation fast speed communications","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"76.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071295S","chronDate":"12-14 Nov. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6766332","isNumber":"6767177","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6766332","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6767177","articleId":"6767210","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6767215,"authors":[{"name":"Agung Fatwanto","affiliation":["Informatics Department, UIN Sunan Kalijaga, Yogyakarta, Indonesia"],"firstName":"Agung","lastName":"Fatwanto","id":"37660103900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2975-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-2974-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2377-262X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2377-2638"}],"articleNumber":"6767215","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":248},"abstract":"This paper proposes a new method for analyzing software requirements specified using a natural language.

In order to decode correctly, the asynchrony between signals must be perfectly dealt with. That is, symbols transmitted by different transmitters could arrive at the receiver with relative carrier frequency offset (CFO), relative carrier phase offset and different channel fading. In this paper, we propose an algorithm to estimate the relative carrier offset from the PLNC signals, and investigate two decoding schemes, JCNC and M-JCNC, to construct the XORed packet. As shown in the simulation results, the algorithm can efficiently estimate the relative carrier offsets and significantly reduce the SNR penalty due to asynchrony.","doi":"10.1109/GHTCE.2013.6767246","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE Global High Tech Congress on Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE Global High Tech Congress on Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/6761207/6767224/06767246.pdf","startPage":"82","endPage":"87","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GHTCE.2013.6767246","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6767224","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An efficient carrier estimation algorithm for two-way relay systems with physical-layer network coding","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6767246","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 Nov. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6767246/","displayDocTitle":"An efficient carrier estimation algorithm for two-way relay systems with physical-layer network coding","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2013","accessionNumber":"14162051","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6767246/","conferenceDate":"17-19 Nov. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"17 March 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An efficient carrier estimation algorithm for two-way relay systems with physical-layer network coding","confLoc":"Shenzhen, China","sourcePdf":"1569856053.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064589S","chronDate":"17-19 Nov. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6761207","isNumber":"6767224","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6761207","xplore-issue":"6767224","articleId":"6767246","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6767255,"authors":[{"name":"Sachin K Rajput","affiliation":["Dept. of ECE ASET, Amity University Noida, INDIA"],"firstName":"Sachin K","lastName":"Rajput","id":"37086038430"},{"name":"B K Hemant","affiliation":["Dept. of ECE MSIT, GGSIP University New Delhi, INDIA"],"firstName":"B K","lastName":"Hemant","id":"37086775786"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-3209-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6767255","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2319},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6767255","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Gain","CMOS integrated circuits","Bandwidth","Educational institutions","Circuit stability","Stability analysis","MOS devices"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["buffer circuits","CMOS integrated circuits","integrated circuit design","mixed analogue-digital integrated circuits","operational amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS technology","gain bandwidth product","CMOS opamp design","current buffer compensation","two stage high gain low power opamp","bandwidth 5.82 MHz","size 0.35 mum","voltage 3.3 V","power 144.3 muW","voltage 61.5 muV","voltage 318 muV"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["CMOS","opamp","low power","current buffer"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents the classic two stage CMOS opamp design by employing the current buffer compensation strategy.

Due to the dynamic characteristics of MANETs, they cannot be applied to these networks well. In this paper we have proposed a one-class SVM for dynamic anomaly detection in mobile ad-hoc networks with AODV routing protocol, called ManetSVM.

The proposed encryption method consists of two phases. In substitution phase, pixels locations are altered to reduce correlation among adjacent pixels. Then, pixels values are changed in the modification phase to encrypt the input image. Both phases are performed by GA with binary chromosomes. For substitution phase, these binary patterns are generated by Local Binary Pattern (LBP) operator while for modification phase binary chromosomes are obtained by Bit Plane Slicing (BPS). Initial population in GA includes rows and columns of the input image. Instead of subjective selection of parents from this initial population, a random generator with predefined key is utilized. Because it is necessary to decrypt the coded image and reconstruct the initial input image. Fitness function is defined as average of transition from 0 to 1 and 1 to 0 in LBP image and histogram uniformity in substitution and modification phases, respectively. Randomness of the encrypted image is measured by entropy, correlation coefficients and histogram analysis. Experimental results show that the proposed method is fast enough and can be used effectively for image encryption.","doi":"10.1109/ISCISC.2013.6767332","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"2013 10th International ISC Conference on Information Security and Cryptology (ISCISC)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCISC.2013.6767332","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6767314","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 10th International ISC Conference on Information Security and Cryptology (ISCISC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6765549/6767314/06767332.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Image encryption using genetic algorithm and binary patterns","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6767332/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Image encryption using genetic algorithm and binary patterns","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6767332/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"14162117","publicationDate":"Aug. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"17 March 2014","conferenceDate":"29-30 Aug. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"29-30 Aug. 2013","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Image encryption using genetic algorithm and binary patterns","confLoc":"Yazd, Iran","sourcePdf":"391.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.08297S","chronDate":"29-30 Aug. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6765549","isNumber":"6767314","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6765549","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6767314","articleId":"6767332","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6767334,"authors":[{"name":"Mohammad K.

In MANETs, it is of great importance to detect anomaly and malicious behavior. In order to detect malicious attacks via intrusion detection systems and analyze the data set, we need to select some features. Hence, feature selection plays critical role in detecting various attacks. In the literature, there are several proposals to select such features. Usually, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) analyzes the data set and the selected features. In this paper, we have collected a feature set from some state-of-the-art works in the literature. Actually, our simulation shows this feature set detect anomaly behavior more accurate. In addition, for the first time, we use robust PCA for analyzing the data set instead of PCA in MANET. By means of robust PCA, we have an unsupervised algorithm versus semi-supervised provided by PCA. In contrast to PCA, our results show robust PCA cannot be affected by outlier data within the network. In this paper, normal and attack states are simulated and the results are analyzed.","doi":"10.1109/ISCISC.2013.6767334","publicationTitle":"2013 10th International ISC Conference on Information Security and Cryptology (ISCISC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 10th International ISC Conference on Information Security and Cryptology (ISCISC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6765549/6767314/06767334.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCISC.2013.6767334","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6767314","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An unsupervised anomaly detection engine with an efficient feature set for AODV","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6767334","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"An unsupervised anomaly detection engine with an efficient feature set for AODV","chronOrPublicationDate":"29-30 Aug. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6767334/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"29-30 Aug. 2013","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2013","accessionNumber":"14180758","dateOfInsertion":"17 March 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6767334/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An unsupervised anomaly detection engine with an efficient feature set for AODV","confLoc":"Yazd, Iran","sourcePdf":"406.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058658S","chronDate":"29-30 Aug. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6765549","isNumber":"6767314","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6765549","xplore-issue":"6767314","articleId":"6767334","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6767349,"authors":[{"name":"Shirin Najdi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering Sahand University of Technology, Tabriz, Iran"],"firstName":"Shirin","lastName":"Najdi","id":"37086795476"},{"name":"Afshin Ebrahimi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering Sahand University of Technology, Tabriz, Iran"],"firstName":"Afshin","lastName":"Ebrahimi","id":"37529999200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-1638-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"DVD ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-1637-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6767349","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":117},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fingerprint recognition","Discrete wavelet transforms","Feature extraction","Robustness","Vectors","Algorithm design and analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["audio signal processing","discrete wavelet transforms","signal resolution","vectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["audio fingerprinting","multiresolution analysis","discrete wavelet transform","octave frequency band approximation","DWT","energy difference","feature vector","mean","zero crossing rate","ZCR","normalized first moment"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Audio Fingerprinting","Discrete Wavelet Transform","Octave Bands","Feature Vector"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, two new fingerprinting techniques based on approximating octave frequency bands using multi-resolution analysis of Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) are presented.

Adaptive trust evaluation is a fundamental component for secure computing in the cloud environment. Although several methods have been proposed recently for modeling and evaluating trust in distributed computing environments, there is no general accepted trust evaluation model for cloud computing. In this paper a new trust evaluation method has been proposed. In this scheme, each new customer of a cloud service can determine its trust level using the past experiences of previous customers of this cloud service. The proposed method introduces an adaptive method that helps distinguish between malicious and reliable customer feedbacks. The proposed scheme assigns a reliability weight to each customer feedback. Users who have shared any cloud service before and did rate it similarly are more likely to have the same opinion of a new service. Hence, their evaluation of a new service should be given a higher weight. In cases where no customer has shared a common service with us before, then existing customers who have had a feedback closer to the majority (in any service) may seem to be more reliable and hence their opinion is given a higher weight. The balance between the feedback of customers with shared service and those of majority consensus in the final decision is determined dynamically and based on the rate of malicious attacks. This way the method can respond better to changes in the rate and sources of malicious attacks. The proposed method has been compared with an existing trust evaluation method and proved its superiority in minimizing the effect of malicious feedbacks, and having a faster response time.","doi":"10.1109/ISCISC.2013.6767353","publicationTitle":"2013 10th International ISC Conference on Information Security and Cryptology (ISCISC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 10th International ISC Conference on Information Security and Cryptology (ISCISC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6765549/6767314/06767353.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCISC.2013.6767353","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6767314","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new trust evaluation method based on reliability of customer feedback for cloud computing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6767353","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"29-30 Aug. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6767353/","displayDocTitle":"A new trust evaluation method based on reliability of customer feedback for cloud computing","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2013","accessionNumber":"14162100","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6767353/","conferenceDate":"29-30 Aug. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"17 March 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new trust evaluation method based on reliability of customer feedback for cloud computing","confLoc":"Yazd, Iran","sourcePdf":"556.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058678S","chronDate":"29-30 Aug. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6765549","isNumber":"6767314","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6765549","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6767314","articleId":"6767353","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6767370,"authors":[{"name":"Durba Chakraborty","affiliation":["ECE Department, Heritage Institute of Technology, Kolkata, India"],"firstName":"Durba","lastName":"Chakraborty","id":"37086730856"},{"name":"Avishek Nag","affiliation":["ECE Department, Heritage Institute of Technology, Kolkata, India"],"firstName":"Avishek","lastName":"Nag","id":"37086734412"},{"name":"Prabir Banerjee","affiliation":["ECE Department, Heritage Institute of Technology, Kolkata, India"],"firstName":"Prabir","lastName":"Banerjee","id":"37085469973"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-3983-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-3982-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6767370","dbTime":"17 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":102},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Tiles","Phase locked loops","Switches","Voltage-controlled oscillators","Interference","Receivers","Transmitters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","noise","radio receivers","radiofrequency interference","tuning","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio receiver","noise content based intelligent tuning","interference sensing quality","degree of interference","switching","radio system","intelligent interfacing","channel dependent receiver performance","radio frequency spectrum"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Bandwidth","Phase locked Loop(PLL)","Radio Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI)","Voltage Controlled Oscillator (VCO)"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6767370","doi":"10.1109/ICECI.2014.6767370","publicationTitle":"International Conference on Electronics, Communication and Instrumentation (ICECI)","abstract":"Cognitive radios should have an inherent quality of sensing interference or the degree of interference in the operating spectrum and then an automatic capability of switching to a less interfering portion of the spectrum.

Here, the original communication infrastructure might be partially or completely damaged, and the whole network might be partitioned into segments (called islands in the following) that might operate on different frequencies/wireless technologies. In this paper, we investigate techniques to maximally re-establish the connectivity among heterogeneous islands through the utilization of specialized repairing units called Stem Nodes (SNs). A SN combines spectrum reconfigurability (offered by the Software Defined Radio technology) with self-positioning and dynamic routing functionalities, and thus it is able to replace damaged components of the original infrastructure. Moreover, sets of SNs can self-organize into multi-hop mesh structures connecting heterogeneous islands. We study the problem of determining the optimal deployment of SNs so that the number of connected devices of the original network is maximized. Given the NP-hardness of the problem, we propose approximated solutions with reduced computational complexity. We then compare the centralized solution with a distributed algorithm (based on virtual springs approach) that enables SNs to explore the environment in both space/frequency domains, and to self-organize into virtual mesh structures. Simulation results confirm the effectiveness of the distributed algorithm to maximally re-establish the network connectivity even on large-scale scenarios.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 June 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6767405/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"14162091","publicationDate":"June 2013","conferenceDate":"24-26 June 2013","dateOfInsertion":"17 March 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Re-establishing network connectivity in post-disaster scenarios through mobile cognitive radio networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Re-establishing network connectivity in post-disaster scenarios through mobile cognitive radio networks","confLoc":"Ajaccio, France","sourcePdf":"p18trotta.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.101721S","chronDate":"24-26 June 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6762820","isNumber":"6767394","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6762820","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6767394","articleId":"6767405","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6767416,"authors":[{"name":"Emna Trigui","affiliation":["CNRS UMR STMR 6279, University of Technology of Troyes, Troyes Cedex, France"],"firstName":"Emna","lastName":"Trigui","id":"38354983700"},{"name":"Moez Esseghir","affiliation":["CNRS UMR STMR 6279, University of Technology of Troyes, Troyes Cedex, France"],"firstName":"Moez","lastName":"Esseghir","id":"38362919600"},{"name":"Leila Merghem-Boulahia","affiliation":["CNRS UMR STMR 6279, University of Technology of Troyes, Troyes Cedex, France"],"firstName":"Leila","lastName":"Merghem-Boulahia","id":"38275864800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-1004-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6767416","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":552},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cognitive radio","Quality of service","Ad hoc networks","Proposals","Conferences","Mobile radio mobility management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","mobility management (mobile radio)","quality of service"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mobility scheme","cognitive radio networks","wireless network","smart devices","spectrum holes","radio spectrum","quality of service","mobility management","cognitive radio systems","cognitive radio users","users application","trading mechanism","cognitive radio users"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cognitive radio","wireless networks","mobility","quality of services","continuity of service","trading","multi-agent systems"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6767416","doi":"10.1109/MedHocNet.2013.6767416","publicationTitle":"2013 12th Annual Mediterranean Ad Hoc Networking Workshop (MED-HOC-NET)","abstract":"S Cognitive radio network is a promising wireless network where smart devices are able to opportunistically exploit the spectrum holes and optimize the overall radio spectrum use.

AT&T's offering for the ASP supports the intelligent-network concept while still interworking with existing switch-based features. Thus, the LECs can maximize use of their previous investment in network-switching hardware and software while still offering new services through the ASP's distributed network intelligence. AT&T has also been working with the Regional Holding Companies and Bellcore to plan their Advanced Intelligent Network Release 1 architecture, which has been proposed as the next-generation, intelligent-network platform. Advanced Intelligent Network Release 1 makes possible an even wider variety of services than the ASP by defining a more flexible switch interface with a corresponding expansion of the communications interface between the switches and external-service-logic nodes.

For IN to succeed, the network operations, administration, maintenance, and provisioning (OAM&P) strategies for IN must be in place, evolvable, and workable.

This operations platform must be flexible enough to provide the necessary OAM&P support for any IN services without additional development work from network element (NE) and operations system (OS) vendors. Once a new service is created, the IN network must be able to deliver and maintain the service by using the OAM&P capabilities available in the IN operations platform. This paper discusses the capabilities and evolutions of major network element's OAM&P for the United States IN in the areas of billing, service provisioning and verification, network engineering, network traffic management, and maintenance.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6767425","publicationTitle":"AT&T Technical Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"AT&T Technical Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/6731003/6767425/06767432.pdf","doi":"10.1002/j.1538-7305.1991.tb00356.x","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1002/j.1538-7305.1991.tb00356.x","startPage":"85","endPage":"98","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Intelligent network OAM&P capabilities and evolutions for network elements","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"Nokia Bell Labs","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Summer  1991","chronOrPublicationDate":"Summer  1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6767432/","displayDocTitle":"Intelligent network OAM&P capabilities and evolutions for network elements","isJournal":true,"volume":"70","issue":"3-4","dateOfInsertion":"30 April 2014","publicationDate":"Summer 1991","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Intelligent network OAM&P capabilities and evolutions for network elements","sourcePdf":"bstj70385.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.049262S","chronDate":"Summer  1991","isNumber":"6767425","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6731003","citationCount":"1","articleId":"6767432","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"Bell Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6767457,"authors":[{"name":"Claude E.

Our work is based on computer simulations of dpcm codes. We have studied pitch detectors based on autocorrelation and an average magnitude difference function (amdf), and we have measured the benefits of predicting from a previous pitch period as functions of pitch-period-updating frequency and periodicity-indicating thresholds (for autocorrelation and the amdf). We have compared several alternative methods of utilizing past quantized samples (in the present and previous pitch periods) for providing speech sample predictions. We find the following combination to be attractive for waveform coding at bit rates in the neighborhood of 16 kb/s: 2-bit adaptive quantization with a one-word (2-bit dpcm word) memory, pitch detection performed on unquantized speech (preferably with an amdf criterion) and a prediction scheme that uses fixed three-tap (short-term) prediction for nonperiodic waveform segments, but switches to an appropriate one-tap (long-term) predictor upon the detection of strong periodicity. With four sample utterances, the latter procedure results in an average SNR (signal-to-noise ratio) gain of 3.75 dB over a non-pitch-adaptive encoder.","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6767522","publicationTitle":"The Bell System Technical Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"The Bell System Technical Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/6731005/6767514/06767522.pdf","startPage":"439","endPage":"454","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6767514","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1002/j.1538-7305.1977.tb00519.x","doi":"10.1002/j.1538-7305.1977.tb00519.x","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Pitch-adaptive DPCM coding of speech with two-bit quantization and fixed spectrum prediction","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"Nokia Bell Labs","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1977","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1977","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6767522/","displayDocTitle":"Pitch-adaptive DPCM coding of speech with two-bit quantization and fixed spectrum prediction","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"30 April 2014","publicationDate":"March 1977","volume":"56","issue":"3","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Pitch-adaptive DPCM coding of speech with two-bit quantization and fixed spectrum prediction","sourcePdf":"bstj563439.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.024024S","chronDate":"March  1977","isNumber":"6767514","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6731005","citationCount":"7","articleId":"6767522","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1977","subType":"Bell Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6767531,"authors":[{"name":"W.

Comparing the number of level crossings of the electric field with that of the energy density, it is shown that the energy density fades less frequently than the electric field by at least a factor of two.

The descramblers recover synchronization quickly after the insertion or deletion of channel bits, and they are relatively insensitive to channel errors. The scramblers act to increase the period of periodic data sequences, and the periodic channel sequences produced have approximately half as many transitions in one period as there are bits in a period. These circuits find application in common carrier systems where short-period data sequences produce high-level tones in the transmission band and, as a consequence, interchannel interference. And they have application when receiver clocks derive synchronization from transitions in the channel signal. A number of variations and modifications of the scramblers which affect their cost and size are considered. The scramblers and descramblers are similar in construction and consist of linear sequential filters with either feed-forward or feedback paths, counters, storage elements and peripheral logic. The counters, storage elements and peripheral logic monitor the channel sequence but react infrequently so that the scramblers and descramblers behave principally as linear sequential filters.","doi":"10.1002/j.1538-7305.1967.tb01066.x","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1002/j.1538-7305.1967.tb01066.x","publicationTitle":"The Bell System Technical Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"The Bell System Technical Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/6731005/6767525/06767532.pdf","startPage":"449","endPage":"487","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6767525","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Some simple self-synchronizing digital data scramblers","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"Nokia Bell Labs","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6767532/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  1967","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb.  1967","displayDocTitle":"Some simple self-synchronizing digital data scramblers","volume":"46","issue":"2","dateOfInsertion":"30 April 2014","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 1967","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Some simple self-synchronizing digital data scramblers","sourcePdf":"bstj462449.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.021675S","chronDate":"Feb.  1967","isNumber":"6767525","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6731005","citationCount":"44","articleId":"6767532","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1967","subType":"Bell Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6767541,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The silicon target, 50 to 150 \u03bcm thick, serves as the tube's vacuum window. Each X-ray photon generates a large number of holes in the silicon substrate. Most of these can be usefully collected, and effective quantum efficiencies over 1000 have been measured. Absolute measurements of the spectral sensitivity have been made and show good agreement with theoretical predictions made using values of hole lifetime and surface recombination velocity obtained from optical measurements on the same target. The silicon diode array offers a number of inherent advantages in X-ray imaging compared with the conventional amorphous selenium target. Among these are greater quantum efficiency, high sensitivity, and temperature stability. The diode array sensitivity greatly exceeds that of film in this X-ray energy range (5 to 20 keV). Moreover, because the video signal current is linear as a function of X-ray photon flux over a wide dynamic range, relative intensities may be compared directly rather than necessitating densitometer measurements as does film. The performance of the many types of X-ray imaging systems in different applications is compared in some detail.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"Nokia Bell Labs","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb.  1969","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  1969","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6767547/","volume":"48","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 1969","dateOfInsertion":"30 April 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Diode array camera tubes and X-ray imaging","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Diode array camera tubes and X-ray imaging","sourcePdf":"bstj4820345.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.026157S","chronDate":"Feb.  1969","isNumber":"6767545","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6731005","citationCount":"2","articleId":"6767547","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1969","subType":"Bell Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6767563,"authors":[{"name":"C.

The equalizer, which is of the transversal filter type, operates in the frequency passband and contains two sets of taps \u2014 in-phase and quadrature. A tap-rotation property of the equalizer is used to establish an absolute phase reference at the equalizer output, and once this crucial step is taken, the passband equalizer output can be used to automatically (as well as adaptively) adjust the tap weights so as to minimize a mean-square distortion function. The resulting algorithm requires correlating an error signal with the tap voltages, and thus it is possible to use a structure similar to that employed when equalizing baseband PAM.

The amplifier usually requires an isolator at its output port, since it does not have substantial loss in the reverse direction.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6767650","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1002/j.1538-7305.1964.tb01019.x","publicationTitle":"The Bell System Technical Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"The Bell System Technical Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/6731005/6767650/06767661.pdf","startPage":"1123","endPage":"1147","doi":"10.1002/j.1538-7305.1964.tb01019.x","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A theory of a unilateral parametric amplifier using two diodes","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"Nokia Bell Labs","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1964","displayDocTitle":"A theory of a unilateral parametric amplifier using two diodes","volume":"43","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 1964","dateOfInsertion":"30 April 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6767661/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1964","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A theory of a unilateral parametric amplifier using two diodes","sourcePdf":"bstj4331123.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033322S","chronDate":"May  1964","isNumber":"6767650","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6731005","citationCount":"6","articleId":"6767661","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1964","subType":"Bell Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-11-23"},{"_id":6767667,"authors":[{"name":"I.

It is the purpose of this paper to determine what kind of performance can be expected from well-designed systems of this type when used to encode television signals. Systems using both previous sample and previous line feedback are considered. A procedure is presented for the design of nonadaptive, time invariant systems which are near optimum in the sense that the resulting signal to unweighted quantizing noise ratios (S/N) are nearly maximum. Simple formulas are derived for these S/N ratios which apply to DPCM as well as standard PCM. Standard PCM is shown to be a special case of DPCM. These formulas are verified by digital computer simulation. Any advantage of DPCM stems from removing the redundancy from the signal to be transmitted. Redundancy in a signal, however, affords a certain protection against noise introduced in the transmission medium. The penalty for removing this redundancy, through DPCM or other means, is that the transmitted signal becomes more fragile and requires a higher-quality transmission medium than would otherwise be required. This penalty is discussed in quantitative terms.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"Nokia Bell Labs","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6767674/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May-June  1966","chronOrPublicationDate":"May-June  1966","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","publicationDate":"May-June 1966","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"30 April 2014","volume":"45","issue":"5","displayDocTitle":"Predictive quantizing systems (differential pulse code modulation) for the transmission of television signals","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Predictive quantizing systems (differential pulse code modulation) for the transmission of television signals","sourcePdf":"bstj455689.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041069S","chronDate":"May-June  1966","isNumber":"6767672","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6731005","citationCount":"96","articleId":"6767674","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1966","subType":"Bell Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6767693,"authors":[{"name":"Nikil S.

A comparison of the effects of digital errors for a logarithmically compandored system transmitting speech is made on the basis of mean square distortion power and the distribution of error magnitude.

There are several multiserver service facilities without extra waiting space at which several classes of customers arrive in independent Poisson processes. Each customer requests service from one server in each facility in a subset of the service facilities, with the subset depending on the customer class. If service can be provided immediately upon arrival at all required facilities, then service begins and all servers assigned to the customer start and finish together.

Prompt adaptation following a severe fade, when accurate data estimates are unavailable, is useful for reducing outage time. To avoid processing and administrative overhead, the adaptation method should not involve violating the transmitted signal with the insertion of equalizer training signals. We approach this kind of equalization by building on an algorithm of D.

The endpoint detection problem is fairly straightforward for high-level speech signals in low-level stationary noise environments (e.g., signal-to-noise ratios greater than 30-dB rms). However, this problem becomes considerably more difficult when either the speech signals are too low in level (relative to the background noise), or when the background noise becomes highly nonstationary. Such conditions are often encountered in the switched telephone network when the limitation on using local dialed-up lines is removed. In such cases the background noise is often highly variable in both level and spectral content because of transmission line characteristics, transients and tones from the line and/or from signal generators, etc. Conventional speech endpoint detectors have been shown to perform very poorly (on the order of 50-percent word detection) under these conditions. In this paper we present an improved word-detection algorithm, which can incorporate both vocabulary (syntactic) and task (semantic) information, leading to word-detection accuracies close to 100 percent for isolated digit detection over a wide range of telephone transmission conditions.","doi":"10.1002/j.1538-7305.1984.tb00016.x","publicationTitle":"AT&T Bell Laboratories Technical Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"AT&T Bell Laboratories Technical Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/6731004/6767782/06767789.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1002/j.1538-7305.1984.tb00016.x","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6767782","startPage":"479","endPage":"498","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An improved word-detection algorithm for telephone-quality speech incorporating both syntactic and semantic constraints","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6767789","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"Nokia Bell Labs","displayDocTitle":"An improved word-detection algorithm for telephone-quality speech incorporating both syntactic and semantic constraints","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1984","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6767789/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1984","isJournal":true,"volume":"63","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 1984","dateOfInsertion":"30 April 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An improved word-detection algorithm for telephone-quality speech incorporating both syntactic and semantic constraints","sourcePdf":"bstj633479.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.045043S","chronDate":"March  1984","isNumber":"6767782","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6731004","citationCount":"26","articleId":"6767789","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1984","subType":"Bell Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6767790,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The digital system considered is a conventional one employing a voltage-controlled oscillator as the modulator and a limiter-discriminator followed by a low-pass filter as the demodulator. Because of the nonlinear nature of the demodulation process, no adequate analytical techniques have been available to provide a satisfactory treatment. Adopting the notion of \u201cclicks\u201d used by S. O. Rice to study threshold effects in analog FM systems, we have succeeded in evolving a theory capable of predicting performance for a wide range of applications. While our theory reinforces some previously derived results for binary and for narrow-band systems, the results obtained here are not confined to these situations. In particular, the inefficiency of the FM discriminator as a detector for a large number of orthogonal signals is quantitatively evaluated, as well as the role of the post-detection filter. Some qualitative aspects of the error-causing mechanisms discussed in the paper are general, but quantitative results are confined to additive Gaussian noise and large signal-to-noise ratios.","publicationTitle":"The Bell System Technical Journal","startPage":"1511","endPage":"1535","doi":"10.1002/j.1538-7305.1966.tb01707.x","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1002/j.1538-7305.1966.tb01707.x","pdfPath":"/iel7/6731005/6767820/06767825.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"The Bell System Technical Journal","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6767820","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Theory of error rates for digital fm","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"Nokia Bell Labs","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6767825/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1966","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1966","displayDocTitle":"Theory of error rates for digital fm","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"30 April 2014","publicationDate":"Nov. 1966","volume":"45","issue":"9","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Theory of error rates for digital fm","sourcePdf":"bstj4591511.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.013553S","chronDate":"Nov.  1966","isNumber":"6767820","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6731005","citationCount":"52","articleId":"6767825","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1966","subType":"Bell Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6767828,"authors":[{"name":"Joseph T.

Unfortunately, the required number of receiver operations per data symbol is an exponential function of the duration of the channel impulse response, resulting in unacceptably large receiver complexity for high-speed PAM data transmission on many channels. We propose a linear prefilter to force the overall impulse response of the channel/prefilter combination to approximate a desired truncated impulse response (DIR) of acceptably short duration. Given the duration of the DIR, the prefilter parameters and the DIR itself can be optimized adaptively to minimize the mean-square error between the output of the prefilter and the desired prefilter output, while constraining the energy in the DIR to be fixed. In this work we show that the minimum mean-square error can be expressed as the minimum eigenvalue of a certain channel-dependent matrix, and that the corresponding eigenvector represents the optimum DIR. An adaptive algorithm is developed and successfully tested. The simulations also show that the prefiltering scheme, used together with the VA for two different channel models, compares favorably in performance with another recently proposed prefiltering scheme. Limiting results for the case where the prefilter is considered to be of infinite length are obtained; it is shown that the optimum DIR of length two must be one of two possible impulse responses related to the duobinary impulse response. Finally we obtain limiting results for the case where the transmitting filter is optimized.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6767854","publicationTitle":"The Bell System Technical Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"The Bell System Technical Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/6731005/6767854/06767858.pdf","doi":"10.1002/j.1538-7305.1973.tb02032.x","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1002/j.1538-7305.1973.tb02032.x","startPage":"1541","endPage":"1562","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive channel memory truncation for maximum likelihood sequence estimation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"Nokia Bell Labs","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1973","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1973","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6767858/","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive channel memory truncation for maximum likelihood sequence estimation","isJournal":true,"volume":"52","issue":"9","dateOfInsertion":"30 April 2014","publicationDate":"Nov. 1973","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive channel memory truncation for maximum likelihood sequence estimation","sourcePdf":"bstj5291541.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.029273S","chronDate":"Nov.  1973","isNumber":"6767854","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6731005","citationCount":"245","articleId":"6767858","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1973","subType":"Bell Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6767876,"authors":[{"name":"Patricia Scanlon","affiliation":["Statistics and Learning Department at Alcatel-Lucent Bell Labs in Blanchardstown, Ireland"],"firstName":"Patricia","lastName":"Scanlon"},{"name":"Irwin O.

The problem of signaling storms caused by increased core network signaling load due to idle mode cell camping on femtocells is addressed and a novel approach to RF fingerprinting is proposed as a solution to tackle this problem by identifying device model types. This study describes a large data set containing 54 Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS) user equipment (UE) devices (41 model types), the largest of its kind reported in the literature. This study also presents a novel feature extraction technique, which greatly improves identification accuracy over standard spectral approaches while limiting the number of random access channel (RACH) preambles required for identification. Accuracy of 99.8 percent was achieved. Importantly, the proposed technique can be implemented using today's low cost high-volume receivers and requires no manual performance tuning.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"Nokia Bell Labs","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6767876/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2010","publicationDate":"Dec. 2010","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"30 April 2014","volume":"15","issue":"3","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Feature extraction approaches to RF fingerprinting for device identification in femtocells","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Feature extraction approaches to RF fingerprinting for device identification in femtocells","sourcePdf":"6767876.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.02171S","chronDate":"Dec.  2010","isNumber":"6767866","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6731002","citationCount":"35","articleId":"6767876","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"Bell Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6767878,"authors":[{"name":"Giovanna Carofiglio","affiliation":["Semantic and Autonomic Technologies department within the Networking and Networks research domain at Alcatel-Lucent Bell Labs in Nozay, France"],"firstName":"Giovanna","lastName":"Carofiglio"},{"name":"Pierre Peloso","affiliation":["Alcatel-Lucent Bell Labs in Nozay, France"],"firstName":"Pierre","lastName":"Peloso"},{"name":"H\u00e9lia Pouyllau","affiliation":["Alcatel-Lucent Bell Labs in Nozay, France"],"firstName":"H\u00e9lia","lastName":"Pouyllau"}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1538-7305"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7089"}],"articleNumber":"6767878","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":48},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6767878","abstract":"The primary goals of self-management are twofold: cost reduction and automated adaptive control of complex network operations. The optimal allocation of resources in dynamic networks has emerged as a recurrent denominator for a branch of self-optimization problems. Like most algorithms for self-management, traditional optimization algorithms are challenged by specific aspects of networks: complexity, scalability, and time variability. This paper proposes to address this class of problems with robust, adaptive, and distributed optimization methods, in order to cope with high levels of dynamicity and uncertainty, while still preserving good convergence properties. We illustrate the benefit of using such methods through two different problems occurring at different network layers: 1) at the transport layer, the flow admission control driven by quality of service (QoS) requirements; 2) at the service layer, the negotiation of service level agreements to sustain multi-domain QoS guarantees.","doi":"10.1002/bltj.20464","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1002/bltj.20464","startPage":"177","endPage":"192","displayPublicationTitle":"Bell Labs Technical Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/6731002/6767866/06767878.pdf","publicationTitle":"Bell Labs Technical Journal","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6767866","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Realizing self-management via self-optimization in dynamic networks: Two examples of dynamic resource allocation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"Nokia Bell Labs","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2010","displayDocTitle":"Realizing self-management via self-optimization in dynamic networks: Two examples of dynamic resource allocation","publicationDate":"Dec. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"30 April 2014","volume":"15","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6767878/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Realizing self-management via self-optimization in dynamic networks: Two examples of dynamic resource allocation","sourcePdf":"6767878.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.030641S","chronDate":"Dec.  2010","isNumber":"6767866","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6731002","articleId":"6767878","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"Bell Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6767885,"authors":[{"name":"Sampath Rangarajan","affiliation":["Center for Networking Research at Bell Labs in Holmdel, New Jersey"],"firstName":"Sampath","lastName":"Rangarajan"},{"name":"John Lin","affiliation":["Networking Software Department of Bell Labs in Holmdel, New Jersey"],"firstName":"John","lastName":"Lin"},{"name":"Sanjoy Paul","affiliation":["Networking Software Research at Bell Labs in Holmdel, New Jersey"],"firstName":"Sanjoy","lastName":"Paul"}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1538-7305"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7089"}],"articleNumber":"6767885","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":65},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6767885","abstract":"The Open Access Research Test-bed for Wireless Networks (ORBIT) is a collaborative project involving industry and academia that is funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF). There are two components to the ORBIT test-bed. One is an indoor lab test-bed of a grid of wireless fidelity (WiFi) access points (APs); the other, a campus-wide field-trial outdoor network that attempts to create a hybrid network of wireless networks by combining third-generation (3G), fixed 802.11, and ad-hoc 802.11 networks. This paper focuses on the outdoor network and describes the various components of the hybrid network architecture. Because wireless clients do not normally have interfaces for disparate access technologies, the network uses mobile wireless gateways (MWGs) that serve as gateways for the mobile clients. These MWGs are able to backhaul traffic over multiple wireless access technologies (e.g., 3G and 802.11a/g/e). The mobile clients communicate with the MWGs using 802.11b links. The MWGs can communicate with the Internet over either the 3G or the fixed 802.11 network. All-Internet Protocol (IP) connectivity is provided to the MWG to access the 3G network using IP base stations (IP-BSs). We discuss various relevant handoff issues \u2014 including IP-BS to IP-BS (P-P) handoff within the 3G network, 3G to 802.11 network handoff, and handoff between different subnets within the 802.11 network \u2014 and present efficient mechanisms for all three handoff scenarios.","doi":"10.1002/bltj.20092","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1002/bltj.20092","startPage":"21","endPage":"38","displayPublicationTitle":"Bell Labs Technical Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/6731002/6767882/06767885.pdf","publicationTitle":"Bell Labs Technical Journal","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6767882","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A campus-wide hybrid 802.11/3G network and its implementation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"Nokia Bell Labs","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Summer  2005","chronOrPublicationDate":"Summer  2005","displayDocTitle":"A campus-wide hybrid 802.11/3G network and its implementation","publicationDate":"Summer 2005","dateOfInsertion":"30 April 2014","volume":"10","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6767885/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A campus-wide hybrid 802.11/3G network and its implementation","sourcePdf":"6767885.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.032308S","chronDate":"Summer  2005","isNumber":"6767882","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6731002","articleId":"6767885","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"Bell Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6767887,"authors":[{"name":"Jean-Philippe Joseph","affiliation":["Data and Broadband Access Network Modeling Group at Bell Labs in Holmdel, New Jersey"],"firstName":"Jean-Philippe","lastName":"Joseph"},{"name":"Paul Justl","affiliation":["Bell Labs' Advanced Technologies Network Planning and Standards Center, Business Modeling, in Holmdel, New Jersey"],"firstName":"Paul","lastName":"Justl"},{"name":"Francis R.

Most SPs believe they can expand their customer base efficiently by offering integrated services that are convenient for end users and that allow them to increase their productivity. SPs with multiple networks also want to eliminate redundancy and further reduce their costs. The emergence of Internet Protocol (IP)-based services, new broadband access technologies, and access-agnostic core architectures made possible by the development of new protocols and based on the IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) have created new network and service convergence dynamics that will enable SPs to deliver a broad range of converged services and truly enrich end users' experiences. This paper discusses the convergence opportunities and the key technical challenges and solutions (e.g., intelligent network [IN]/SIP interworking, operations convergence and quality of service [QoS]) that will enable wireline-wireless convergence to become a reality. It also presents a converged network evolution case study for an incumbent SP with separate wireless and wireline networks.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"Nokia Bell Labs","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6767887/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Summer  2005","chronOrPublicationDate":"Summer  2005","publicationDate":"Summer 2005","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"30 April 2014","volume":"10","issue":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Converged wireline-wireless network evolution: Opportunities and challenges","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Converged wireline-wireless network evolution: Opportunities and challenges","sourcePdf":"6767887.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.032549S","chronDate":"Summer  2005","isNumber":"6767882","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6731002","citationCount":"1","articleId":"6767887","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"Bell Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6767891,"authors":[{"name":"Angeliki Alexiou","affiliation":["Wireless Research Laboratory at Bell Labs in Swindon, England"],"firstName":"Angeliki","lastName":"Alexiou"},{"name":"Constantinos B.

Our approach to bringing such robustness to space-time encoded systems is to introduce linear precoding, which is designed to account for the effects of antenna correlation. After verifying the success of this approach in improving the robustness of MIMO links, we evaluate its benefits at the system level. We introduce link-to-system interface metrics to ensure realistic evaluation of system-level performance, and we evaluate the average-system-throughput and number-of-satisfied-users performance metrics. Finally, we describe our simulations, which demonstrate the performance improvements that can be achieved by applying reconfigurable techniques rather than conventional ones.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reconfigurable MIMO transceivers for next-generation wireless systems","publicationTitle":"Bell Labs Technical Journal","doi":"10.1002/bltj.20098","displayPublicationTitle":"Bell Labs Technical Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/6731002/6767882/06767891.pdf","startPage":"139","endPage":"156","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1002/bltj.20098","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6767882","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6767891","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"Nokia Bell Labs","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6767891/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Summer  2005","chronOrPublicationDate":"Summer  2005","displayDocTitle":"Reconfigurable MIMO transceivers for next-generation wireless systems","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"10","issue":"2","dateOfInsertion":"30 April 2014","publicationDate":"Summer 2005","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reconfigurable MIMO transceivers for next-generation wireless systems","sourcePdf":"6767891.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047285S","chronDate":"Summer  2005","isNumber":"6767882","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6731002","articleId":"6767891","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"Bell Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":6767922,"authors":[{"name":"R.

Error clustering occurs because the bit duration is typically much smaller than that of a signal \u201cfade,\u201d and average bit-error probabilities greater than 1 percent are not uncommon. For speech communication over such channels, this paper proposes variable step-size differential coders based on explicit (and error-protected) transmission of quantizer step size. Specifically, we discuss delta and dpcm coders to be referred to as dm-aqf and dpcm-aqf, where aqf stands for adaptive quantization with forward estimation (and transmission) of step size. (Backward estimation, based on quantized-signal history, has the nice feature that the step-size information does not have to be explicitly transmitted. Furthermore, obtaining this information does not entail any encoding delay. However, due to the dependence of step size on reconstructed signal history, backward estimation is often less reliable in the presence of bit errors than a scheme based on aqf.) The studies reported in this paper cover the problem of step-size determination in aqf, the design of time-invariant first-order predictors for dpcm-aqf, and the performances of aqf encoders with and without burst-error-protecting ploys such as redundant time-diversity coding and bit scrambling. Judging from snr figures and informal listening tests, interesting results are obtained with the following 48-kb/s coders: three-bit dpcm-aqf with redundant error protection, and dm-aqf using bit scrambling.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"Nokia Bell Labs","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6768025/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1975","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1975","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","publicationDate":"Nov. 1975","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"30 April 2014","volume":"54","issue":"9","displayDocTitle":"Step-size transmitting differential coders for mobile telephony","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Step-size transmitting differential coders for mobile telephony","sourcePdf":"bstj5491557.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.014174S","chronDate":"Nov.  1975","isNumber":"6768021","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6731005","citationCount":"20","articleId":"6768025","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1975","subType":"Bell Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6768027,"authors":[{"name":"P.

Virtualization multiplexes virtual resources onto physical ones, typically by time division or statistical multiplexing. Time, in the virtual machine, is therefore as virtual as the machine itself. And fault tolerance is difficult to achieve when redundancy and independent failure in the virtual environment do not necessarily map to those properties in the physical environment. Virtualization adds a level of indirection that creates overhead, and makes it all but impossible to achieve predictable performance. Osprey uses an alternative to virtualization that achieves the same goals of scalability and flexibility but carries neither the overhead of virtualization, nor the restrictions on dependability. The result is a programming environment that achieves most of the compatibility offered by traditional virtualization efforts and provides much better and much more predictable performance. One technique we use is called Library OS, which stems from high-performance computing. The technique consists of linking applications with a library that implements most services normally provided by the operating system, creating an application that can run practically stand alone, or at least with a very minimal operating system. The Library OS approach moves the boundary between application and operating system down to a level where interactions with the operating system consist of sending/receiving messages (e.g., network packets) and scheduling resources (processor, memory, network bandwidth, and device access). These interactions, as we demonstrate, form a relatively weak bond between an application and the particular instance of the operating system on which it runs \u2014 one that can be broken and re-established elsewhere. In fact, we make sure this is the case. Legacy applications that cannot be recompiled or relinked can make use of a Library OS server that runs as a tandem process along with the legacy application processes. System calls from the legacy process are catapulted into the Library OS server which executes them. Applications can still migrate, taking their server process along with them. \u00a9 2012 Alcatel-Lucent.","doi":"10.1002/bltj.21542","publicationTitle":"Bell Labs Technical Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"Bell Labs Technical Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/6731002/6768041/06768046.pdf","startPage":"25","endPage":"39","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6768041","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1002/bltj.21542","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Predictable cloud computing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"Nokia Bell Labs","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6768046/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2012","displayDocTitle":"Predictable cloud computing","dateOfInsertion":"30 April 2014","publicationDate":"Sept. 2012","isJournal":true,"volume":"17","issue":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Predictable cloud computing","sourcePdf":"6768046.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.028631S","chronDate":"Sept.  2012","isNumber":"6768041","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6731002","citationCount":"1","articleId":"6768046","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"Bell Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6768047,"authors":[{"name":"Francisco J.

This paper presents an overview of NIX, an operating system for manycore central processing units (CPUs) which addresses the challenges of running high performance applications on commodity cloud systems. NIX features a heterogeneous CPU model and uses a shared address space. NIX has been influenced by our work on Blue Gene and more traditional clusters. NIX partitions cores by function: timesharing cores (TCs); application cores (ACs); and kernel cores (KCs). One or more TCs run traditional applications. KCs are optional, running kernel functions on demand. ACs are also optional, devoted to running an application with no interrupts; not even clock interrupts. Unlike traditional kernels, functions are not static: the number of TCs, KCs, and ACs can change as needed. Also unlike traditional systems, applications can communicate by sending messages to the TC kernel, instead of system call traps. These messages are \u201cactive\u201d taking advantage of the shared-memory nature of manycore CPUs to pass pointers to data and code to coordinate cores. \u00a9 2012 Alcatel-Lucent.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"NIX: A case for a manycore system for cloud computing","publicationTitle":"Bell Labs Technical Journal","doi":"10.1002/bltj.21543","displayPublicationTitle":"Bell Labs Technical Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/6731002/6768041/06768047.pdf","startPage":"41","endPage":"54","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1002/bltj.21543","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6768041","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6768047","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"Nokia Bell Labs","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6768047/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2012","displayDocTitle":"NIX: A case for a manycore system for cloud computing","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"17","issue":"2","dateOfInsertion":"30 April 2014","publicationDate":"Sept. 2012","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"NIX: A case for a manycore system for cloud computing","sourcePdf":"6768047.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034314S","chronDate":"Sept.  2012","isNumber":"6768041","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6731002","citationCount":"3","articleId":"6768047","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"Bell Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6768051,"authors":[{"name":"Xueli An","affiliation":["Bell Labs in Antwerp, Belgium"],"firstName":"Xueli","lastName":"An"},{"name":"Fabio Pianese","affiliation":["Bell Labs in Antwerp, Belgium"],"firstName":"Fabio","lastName":"Pianese"},{"name":"Indra Widjaja","affiliation":["Enabling Computing Technologies Research Domain"],"firstName":"Indra","lastName":"Widjaja"},{"name":"Utku G\u00fcnay Acer","affiliation":["Bell Labs in Antwerp, Belgium"],"firstName":"Utku G\u00fcnay","lastName":"Acer"}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1538-7305"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7089"}],"articleNumber":"6768051","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":434},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6768051","abstract":"DMME is a distributed architecture that implements mobility management for next-generation cellular systems. It has been designed to serve as a scalable and cost-effective drop-in replacement for the Long Term Evolution (LTE) mobility management entity (MME). DMME is an example of a flexible control plane architecture that can be deployed incrementally across operator networks: processing locality is obtained by assigning control plane events to a local DMME replica and by allowing the transparent migration of control plane state across the different replicas as the users move. We evaluate the DMME scheme via analysis and simulation under several deployment scenarios, using mobility patterns drawn from both synthetic models and traces collected in a production network. Our analysis shows that DMME can achieve performances that are comparable with a centralized, server-based infrastructure in terms of system availability and signaling delay. Furthermore, we propose and evaluate a set of heuristics based on user behavior that specify the allocation policy of DMME instances over the available replicas. We also report preliminary performance figures from our DMME prototype implementation. Our results confirm that distributed architectures are a viable choice to reliably support high-throughput, latency-sensitive control plane functions such as cellular mobility management. \u00a9 2012 Alcatel-Lucent.","doi":"10.1002/bltj.21547","publicationTitle":"Bell Labs Technical Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"Bell Labs Technical Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/6731002/6768041/06768051.pdf","startPage":"97","endPage":"120","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1002/bltj.21547","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6768041","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"DMME: A distributed LTE mobility management entity","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"Nokia Bell Labs","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6768051/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2012","displayDocTitle":"DMME: A distributed LTE mobility management entity","volume":"17","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"30 April 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"DMME: A distributed LTE mobility management entity","sourcePdf":"6768051.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.026647S","chronDate":"Sept.  2012","isNumber":"6768041","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6731002","citationCount":"11","articleId":"6768051","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"Bell Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6768062,"authors":[{"name":"S.

At the network edge or at the end equipment, an ATM adaptation layer (AAL) maps the services offered by the ATM network to the services required by the application. Many trunking applications that have voice compression and silence suppression require transmission of small delay-sensitive packets. Existing AALs are very inefficient for this purpose. In this paper, we discuss a new AAL called the AAL Type 2 (AAL-2), which allows very high efficiency for carrying small packets. We describe the basic principles and compare several alternatives with respect to transmission error performance, bandwidth efficiency, and delay/jitter performance. The results show that the AAL-2 adds significant value to packet telephony applications over ATM networks. We discuss the desirability of additional rebundling in the network and the need for a signaling protocol to communicate changes in native connections (voice calls) within the same ATM connection. We also describe how the principles of the AAL-2 are being used to define multiplexing protocols over the Internet and frame-relay networks.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"AAL-2 \u2014 A new ATM adaptation layer for small packet encapsulation and multiplexing","publicationTitle":"Bell Labs Technical Journal","doi":"10.1002/bltj.2051","displayPublicationTitle":"Bell Labs Technical Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/6731002/6768076/06768084.pdf","startPage":"111","endPage":"131","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1002/bltj.2051","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6768076","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6768084","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"Nokia Bell Labs","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6768084/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Spring  1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"Spring  1997","displayDocTitle":"AAL-2 \u2014 A new ATM adaptation layer for small packet encapsulation and multiplexing","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"2","issue":"2","dateOfInsertion":"30 April 2014","publicationDate":"Spring 1997","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"AAL-2 \u2014 A new ATM adaptation layer for small packet encapsulation and multiplexing","sourcePdf":"2051ftp.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.020506S","chronDate":"Spring  1997","isNumber":"6768076","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6731002","citationCount":"21","articleId":"6768084","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"Bell Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6768089,"authors":[{"name":"William J.

In part, the popularity of CDMA among wireless service providers results from CDMA's use of packet switching for routing voice, data, and signaling. However, CDMA callers are usually talking to users of wireline telephones on the public switched telephone network (PSTN). This paper examines Lucent Technologies' CDMA packet switched network (PSN), which uses asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) to interconnect the 5ESS\u00ae PSN elements. We discuss how voice packets go from the CDMA phone to several cell sites, through the ATM-based PSN, to the circuit-switched PSTN. We show how CDMA provides superior voice clarity and quiet soft handoffs as the CDMA caller travels among cell sites. We discover that the 5ESS PSN is highly reliable, scaleable, and flexible, and supports a high capacity of traffic. Finally, we look at plans to evolve the architecture to increase its robustness and capacity.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"5ESS\u00ae packet switched network with ATM interconnect for CDMA","publicationTitle":"Bell Labs Technical Journal","doi":"10.1002/bltj.2056","displayPublicationTitle":"Bell Labs Technical Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/6731002/6768076/06768089.pdf","startPage":"203","endPage":"212","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1002/bltj.2056","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6768076","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6768089","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"Nokia Bell Labs","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6768089/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Spring  1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"Spring  1997","displayDocTitle":"5ESS\u00ae packet switched network with ATM interconnect for CDMA","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"2","issue":"2","dateOfInsertion":"30 April 2014","publicationDate":"Spring 1997","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"5ESS\u00ae packet switched network with ATM interconnect for CDMA","sourcePdf":"2056ftp.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.063902S","chronDate":"Spring  1997","isNumber":"6768076","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6731002","citationCount":"1","articleId":"6768089","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"Bell Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":6768096,"authors":[{"name":"John R.

An automatic equalizer was shown which used this algorithm during a training period of test pulse transmission prior to actual data transmission. The present paper extends the utility of this automatic equalization system by permitting it to change settings during the data transmission period in response to changes in transmission channel characteristics. Three schemes for accomplishing this adaptive equalization without the use of test signals are described and evaluated analytically. The first such scheme uses periodic estimates of channel response based on the received data signal to adjust or update the transversal filter settings. The second system is entirely digital and employs a sequential testing procedure to make adjustments aperiodically as they are required by changing conditions.

Of the three systems described, the second is not only theoretically superior, but is practically the simplest.

As a result, subscriber churn has become an important issue for mobile operators as subscribers switch operators for a variety of reasons. Mobile operators typically employ churn prediction algorithms based on service usage metrics, network performance indicators, and traditional demographic information. A newly emerging technique is the use of social network analysis (SNA) to identify potential churners. Intuitively, a subscriber who is churning will have an impact on the churn propensity of his social circle. Call detail records are useful to understand the social connectivity of subscribers through call graphs but do not directly provide the strength of their relationship or have enough information to determine the diffusion of churn influence. In this paper, we present a way to address these challenges by developing a new churn prediction algorithm based on a social network analysis of the call graph. We provide a formulation that quantifies the strength of social ties between users based on multiple attributes and then apply an influence diffusion model over the call graph to determine the net accumulated influence from churners. We combine this influence and other social factors with more traditional metrics and apply machine-learning methods to compute the propensity to churn for individual users. We evaluate the performance of our algorithm over a real data set and quantify the benefit of using SNA in churn prediction.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6768302","publicationTitle":"Bell Labs Technical Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"Bell Labs Technical Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/6731002/6768302/06768308.pdf","doi":"10.1002/bltj.21575","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1002/bltj.21575","startPage":"63","endPage":"76","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Prediction of subscriber churn using social network analysis","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"Nokia Bell Labs","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6768308/","displayDocTitle":"Prediction of subscriber churn using social network analysis","isJournal":true,"volume":"17","issue":"4","dateOfInsertion":"30 April 2014","publicationDate":"March 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Prediction of subscriber churn using social network analysis","sourcePdf":"6768308.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034247S","chronDate":"March  2013","isNumber":"6768302","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6731002","citationCount":"11","articleId":"6768308","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"Bell Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6768324,"authors":[{"name":"C.

The approximations are expressed in terms of the normal distribution and the peakedness of the arrival process. They are obtained by applying previous heavy-traffic limit theorems and a conditioning heuristic. There are interesting connections to Hayward's approximation, generalized peakedness, asymptotic expansions for the Erlang loss function, the normal-distribution method, and bounds for the blocking probability. For the case of no extra waiting space, a renewal arrival process and an exponential service-time distribution (the GI/M/s/0 model), a heavy-traffic local limit theorem by A. A. Borovkov implies that the blocking depends on the arrival process only through the first two moments of the renewal interval as the offered load increases. Moreover, in this situation Hayward's approximation is asymptotically correct.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"Nokia Bell Labs","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6768361/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May-June  1984","chronOrPublicationDate":"May-June  1984","publicationDate":"May-June 1984","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"30 April 2014","volume":"63","issue":"5","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Heavy-traffic approximations for service systems with blocking","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Heavy-traffic approximations for service systems with blocking","sourcePdf":"bstj635689.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034505S","chronDate":"May-June  1984","isNumber":"6768360","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6731004","citationCount":"16","articleId":"6768361","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1984","subType":"Bell Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6768383,"authors":[{"name":"L.

The two types are basically similar, consisting of two feedback amplifiers in tandem separated by an inter-amplifier network; in the line amplifier this network is variable and is automatically adjusted to compensate for variations in cable temperature and for small deviations from the nominal four-mile spacing. Coupling networks employing high-precision transformers are used to connect the amplifers to the coaxial cable through the required power separation filters. The low impedance windings of the transformers are center-tapped and a balancing network provided in order to match the cable impedance over the transmitted frequency band. The amplifiers are equipped with plug-in tubes of high figure of merit which were developed for this application. A double-triode output stage is used to obtain improved system signal-to-noise performance. Provision is made for preventive maintenance of vacuum tubes and for a controlled adjustment of gain on an in-service basis. All important components of the amplifier are subject to quality control procedures to assure that the average gain of groups of amplifiers will be held within narrow limits and that individual amplifiers will form a normal distribution around the average. This approach is essential in order to meet system equalization and signal-to-noise objectives. Careful mechanical design and rigid control of the mechanical aspects of manufacture are necessary to minimize gain variations which might be caused by variations of parasitic circuit elements and unwanted feedback effects. Special measures were required to keep the temperature rise within the sealed die-cast housing within tolerable values.","doi":"10.1002/j.1538-7305.1953.tb03715.x","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1002/j.1538-7305.1953.tb03715.x","startPage":"879","endPage":"914","displayPublicationTitle":"The Bell System Technical Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/6731005/6768379/06768383.pdf","publicationTitle":"The Bell System Technical Journal","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6768379","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The L3 coaxial system: Amplifiers","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"Nokia Bell Labs","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  1953","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  1953","displayDocTitle":"The L3 coaxial system: Amplifiers","publicationDate":"July 1953","dateOfInsertion":"30 April 2014","volume":"32","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6768383/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The L3 coaxial system: Amplifiers","sourcePdf":"bstj324879.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.017832S","chronDate":"July  1953","isNumber":"6768379","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6731005","citationCount":"4","articleId":"6768383","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1953","subType":"Bell Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6768429,"authors":[{"name":"Bela Julesz","firstName":"Bela","lastName":"Julesz"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0005-8580"}],"articleNumber":"6768429","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":51,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":602},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6768429","abstract":"The perception of depth involves monocular and binocular depth cues. The latter seem simpler and more suitable for investigation. Particularly important is the problem of finding binocular parallax, which involves matching patterns of the left and right visual fields. Stereo pictures of familiar objects or line drawings preclude the separation of interacting cues, and thus this pattern-matching process is difficult to investigate. More insight into the process can be gained by using unfamiliar picture material devoid of all cues except binocular parallax. To this end, artificial stereo picture pairs were generated on a digital computer. When viewed monocularly, they appear completely random, but if viewed binocularly, certain correlated point domains are seen in depth. By introducing distortions in this material and testing for perception of depth, it is possible to show that pattern-matching of corresponding points of the left and right visual fields can be achieved by first combining the two fields and then searching for patterns in the fused field. By this technique, some interesting properties of this fused binocular field are revealed, and a simple analog model is derived. The interaction between the monocular and binocular fields is also describea. A number of stereo images that demonstrate these and other findings are presented.","doi":"10.1002/j.1538-7305.1960.tb03954.x","publicationTitle":"The Bell System Technical Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"The Bell System Technical Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/6731005/6768428/06768429.pdf","startPage":"1125","endPage":"1162","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1002/j.1538-7305.1960.tb03954.x","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6768428","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Binocular depth perception of computer-generated patterns","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"Nokia Bell Labs","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6768429/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1960","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1960","displayDocTitle":"Binocular depth perception of computer-generated patterns","volume":"39","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 1960","dateOfInsertion":"30 April 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Binocular depth perception of computer-generated patterns","sourcePdf":"bstj3951125.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.026052S","chronDate":"Sept.  1960","isNumber":"6768428","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6731005","citationCount":"51","articleId":"6768429","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1960","subType":"Bell Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6768433,"authors":[{"name":"David Slepian","firstName":"David","lastName":"Slepian"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0005-8580"}],"articleNumber":"6768433","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":28,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":74},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6768433","abstract":"The notion of equivalence for group codes is explored in some detail.

We consider the possibility that the two fibers of different dimensions are separated in longitudinal direction and are tilted or offset with respect to each other. Central to our discussion is the observation that the modes of single-mode fibers are very nearly gaussian in shape regardless of the fiber type step-index or graded-index. The splice losses are thus related to the corresponding losses of gaussian beams. We specify the relation between the actual mode field and the gaussian beam that matches this field optimally. The trade-off between slice tolerances with respect to tilt and offset is expressed as an \u201cuncertainty principle. \u201c Because of the near-gaussian nature of single-mode fiber fields, our results are immediately applicable to the excitation of single-mode fibers by gaussian-shaped laser beams.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"Nokia Bell Labs","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6768444/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May-June  1977","chronOrPublicationDate":"May-June  1977","publicationDate":"May-June 1977","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"30 April 2014","volume":"56","issue":"5","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Loss analysis of single-mode fiber splices","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Loss analysis of single-mode fiber splices","sourcePdf":"bstj565703.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.026738S","chronDate":"May-June  1977","isNumber":"6768441","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6731005","citationCount":"282","articleId":"6768444","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1977","subType":"Bell Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6768486,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The self-synchronizing property deals with the ability of the deciphering circuits to get in phase automatically with the enciphering circuits. Exhaustive encodings have the property that all possible sequences of binary digits can occur as messages. Alphabetical-order encodings are those for which the alphabetical order of the letters is preserved as the numerical order of the binary codes, and would be of possible value for sorting of data or consultation of files or dictionaries.

The problem of finding simply implemented decoding algorithms or, equivalently, codes which can be decoded simply with existing methods, is perhaps the outstanding unsolved problem in coding theory today. In this paper, a new class of random-error-correcting cyclic codes is defined. These codes have two very desirable features: the binary members of the class are nearly as powerful as the best-known codes in the range of interest, and they can be decoded with the simplest known decoding algorithm. Unfortunately there are relatively few codes with useful parameters in this class, despite the fact that the class is infinite.","doi":"10.1002/j.1538-7305.1966.tb01686.x","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1002/j.1538-7305.1966.tb01686.x","startPage":"1045","endPage":"1055","publicationTitle":"The Bell System Technical Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"The Bell System Technical Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/6731005/6768537/06768539.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6768537","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Difference-set cyclic codes","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"Nokia Bell Labs","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6768539/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1966","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1966","displayDocTitle":"Difference-set cyclic codes","volume":"45","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"30 April 2014","publicationDate":"Sept. 1966","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Difference-set cyclic codes","sourcePdf":"bstj4571045.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.105701S","chronDate":"Sept.  1966","isNumber":"6768537","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6731005","citationCount":"59","articleId":"6768539","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1966","subType":"Bell Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6768540,"authors":[{"name":"R.

Optimization yields at most 4 dB more. Computer simulation of the system using actual speech samples leads to data supporting the figure of merit as a useful measure of performance for DPCM systems with four digits or more. The simulation also provides data on the error spectrum as a function of quantizer loading and on the probability density of the quantizer input as a function of loading. Performance of the optimum system as a function of increasing feedback network complexity is also shown.

This paper presents models to quantify the interdependencies of critical infrastructures in the U.S. and evaluate plans to compensate for vulnerabilities. Communications is a key infrastructure, central to all others, so that understanding and modeling the risk due to communications disruptions is a high priority in order to enhance public safety and infrastructure resiliency. This paper discusses reliability modeling and analysis at a higher level than usual. Reliability analysis typically deals at the component or sub-system level and talks about \u201cmean time to failure\u201d and \u201cmean time to repair\u201d to derive availability estimates of equipment. Here, we deal with aggregate scales of failures, restoration, and mitigation across national infrastructures. This aggregate scale is useful when examining multiple infrastructures simultaneously with their interdependencies. System dynamics simulation models have been created for both communication networks and for the infrastructure interaction models that quantify these interactions using a risk-informed decision process for the evaluation of alternate protective measures and investment strategies in support of critical infrastructure protection. We will describe an example development of these coupled infrastructure consequence models and their application to the analysis of a power disruption and its cascading effect on the telecommunications infrastructure as well as the emergency services infrastructure. The results show significant impacts across infrastructures that can become increasingly exacerbated if the consumer population moves more and more to telecom services without power lifeline.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"Nokia Bell Labs","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Fall  2006","chronOrPublicationDate":"Fall  2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6768553/","volume":"11","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Fall 2006","dateOfInsertion":"30 April 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Critical national infrastructure reliability modeling and analysis","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Critical national infrastructure reliability modeling and analysis","sourcePdf":"6768553.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.04527S","chronDate":"Fall  2006","isNumber":"6768547","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6731002","citationCount":"14","articleId":"6768553","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"Bell Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6768608,"authors":[{"name":"A.

Rapid prototyping therefore provides an important vehicle for incorporating quality and usability from the outset. Through realistic experience and interaction with the proposed user interface, users and user-interface designers can work together to detect and correct problems before a major development investment is made. The prototyping approach is especially powerful because it provides the opportunity for (1) early user feedback and performance data, (2) efficient, focused communication with users and developers, and (3) iterative design and test.

(i) We develop an analytic model for the transistor which describes small signal linear performance and nonlinear effects. The linear model is matched to the measured h-parameters of the device over a wide range of frequency and bias current. We superimpose three distinct nonlinear effects on this linear skeleton model, all approximated to third order terms. (ii) We show experimental confirmation that, for some bias-load conditions, the second order distortion can be minimized and we show that it is possible to simultaneously minimize both second- and third-order distortion under the same bias-load condition. This result also is confirmed experimentally. (iii) We derive and discuss in detail an analytic expression for the optimum load. Based on this expression, we present detailed procedures for finding this optimum condition for any transistor, and give experimental corroboration. (iv) We give a qualitative description of the interaction among these three nonlinear effects based on an analog computer simulation of the model. This description makes it easier to visualize the distortion cancellation phenomena derived in this paper, and indicates a technique for extending the effect to a broad band of frequencies. We conclude that proper use of the distortion cancellation effect can greatly improve intermodulation performance in existing transistors.","doi":"10.1002/j.1538-7305.1968.tb00047.x","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1002/j.1538-7305.1968.tb00047.x","startPage":"315","endPage":"342","displayPublicationTitle":"The Bell System Technical Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/6731005/6768663/06768666.pdf","publicationTitle":"The Bell System Technical Journal","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6768663","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Eliminating broadband distortion in transistor amplifiers","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"Nokia Bell Labs","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1968","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1968","displayDocTitle":"Eliminating broadband distortion in transistor amplifiers","publicationDate":"March 1968","dateOfInsertion":"30 April 2014","volume":"47","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6768666/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Eliminating broadband distortion in transistor amplifiers","sourcePdf":"bstj4703315.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041289S","chronDate":"March  1968","isNumber":"6768663","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6731005","citationCount":"5","articleId":"6768666","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1968","subType":"Bell Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":6768668,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Results suggest that defining the resistor geometry, trimming the resistors to value, fabricating gap capacitors, and defining interconnecting circuitry might be performed by such a laser. Pattern generation by laser machining has been demonstrated on various thin and electroplated films. Vaporized lines (gaps) are readily attainable as fine as 0.25 mil in thin films and 0.4 mil in plated films. Much thinner lines may be obtained under particularly well-controlled conditions. These films may be removed with minimum effect to the substrate surface. The heat-affected region of the substrate may be confined to less than one film thickness. Better laser output control and shorter pulse widths will diminish this thickness. Gap capacitors have been made on sapphire substrates with capacitance approaching 20 pf in 0.04 square inches, and experiments suggest improvements. Tantalum films may be shaped to resistor geometries and trimmed to tolerance by removing metal or by oxidizing the resistive film with the laser. Resistors usually can be trimmed to tolerances of less than \u00b10.1 per cent. With further development it might be possible to combine these laser machining processes into a single-step, automated fabricating procedure for certain types of integrated circuits. We review some of the technical aspects of this and discuss using Q-spoiled YAG lasers to directly machine masks for photoetching.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"Nokia Bell Labs","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6768668/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1968","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1968","publicationDate":"March 1968","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"30 April 2014","volume":"47","issue":"3","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Laser machining of thin films and integrated circuits","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Laser machining of thin films and integrated circuits","sourcePdf":"bstj4703385.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.027627S","chronDate":"March  1968","isNumber":"6768663","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6731005","citationCount":"15","articleId":"6768668","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1968","subType":"Bell Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6768671,"authors":[{"name":"V.

The boundary value problem is first formulated rather generally in terms of a vector two dimensional integral equation for an array of elements that are arranged in a doubly periodic grid along two skewed (nonorthogonal) coordinates. Dielectric plugs, covers, and loading, as well as thin irises at the aperture, are accounted for in the formulation. Numerical solutions are obtained by using the Ritz-Galerkin method to solve the integral equation. Excellent agreement with experimental measurements using a waveguide simulator is observed. The existence of forced surface wave phenomena in equilateral triangular grid arrays and their strong dependence upon the mode of excitation is also demonstrated.

While LTE as well as Wideband Code Division Multiple Access (WCDMA) suffers uplink interference especially with a frequency reuse factor of one, WCDMA has some inherent layer 1 mechanisms to alleviate these effects, namely macro-diversity and spreading codes. In contrast, LTE user data are more localized in the time/frequency domain, calling for different mechanisms for interference reduction in the receiver. For the higher layers, techniques such as fractional power control or fractional frequency reuse can be used to mitigate the interference but are shown to be sub-optimal. For layer 1, interference rejection combining (IRC) is described as an efficient alternative to increase uplink bit rates in areas where cells overlap. IRC principles in the presence of radio fading channels are detailed, while strategies for both interference suppression and signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) maximization are considered. Taking a didactic approach, we compare multiple antenna receiver techniques (maximal ratio combining (MRC), IRC, multiple input multiple output (MIMO)), analyze the key factors of IRC efficiency (the number of receiving antennas and interferers, time synchronization, interference over thermal, and scheduling decisions), and provide link level performance comparisons. We also provide implementation considerations for integrating the IRC in the current eNodeB receiver. As the purpose of this paper is to give a basic level introduction to IRC applied to the LTE uplink and highlight the respective surroundings, the IRC approach will be covered rather intuitively by illustrations without a great deal of theoretical detail. \u00a9 2012 Alcatel-Lucent.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6768730","publicationTitle":"Bell Labs Technical Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"Bell Labs Technical Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/6731002/6768730/06768734.pdf","doi":"10.1002/bltj.21522","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1002/bltj.21522","startPage":"25","endPage":"49","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Interference rejection combining in LTE networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"Nokia Bell Labs","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6768734/","displayDocTitle":"Interference rejection combining in LTE networks","isJournal":true,"volume":"17","issue":"1","dateOfInsertion":"30 April 2014","publicationDate":"June 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Interference rejection combining in LTE networks","sourcePdf":"6768734.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.024305S","chronDate":"June  2012","isNumber":"6768730","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6731002","citationCount":"12","articleId":"6768734","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"Bell Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6768776,"authors":[{"name":"Jochen Maes","affiliation":["Alcatel-Lucent Bell Labs Access Node Technology and DSL team in Antwerp, Belgium"],"firstName":"Jochen","lastName":"Maes"},{"name":"Michael Peeters","affiliation":["Alcatel-Lucent Bell Labs Access Node Technology and DSL team in Antwerp, Belgium"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Peeters"},{"name":"Mamoun Guenach","affiliation":["Alcatel-Lucent Bell Labs Access Node Technology and DSL team in Antwerp, Belgium"],"firstName":"Mamoun","lastName":"Guenach"},{"name":"Charles Storry","affiliation":["Alcatel-Lucent's Access Division and is located in Ottawa, Canada"],"firstName":"Charles","lastName":"Storry"}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1538-7305"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7089"}],"articleNumber":"6768776","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":15,"totalDownloads":90},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6768776","abstract":"As new services demand increased performance and stability from the access network, some new tools can be brought into play that help maximize the existing copper plant's potential.

In addition to these maintenance tools, dynamic line management (DLM) can be used to maximize loop performance across a group of lines. DLM is already useful in today's digital subscriber line (DSL) networks and becomes a prerequisite when dynamic spectrum management (DSM) techniques are employed. This applies immediately to mixed deployments of asymmetric digital subscriber line (ADSL) and very high speed digital subscriber line (VDSL) and will be even more useful when crosstalk cancellation is deployed.

It enables operators to address new markets and introduce new high-speed services and disruptive pricing strategies to capture wireline voice minutes and to grow revenues. One of the main design challenges of the femtocell is that the hierarchical architecture and manual cell planning processes used in macrocell networks do not scale to support millions of femtocells. In this paper, a user-deployed femtocell solution based on the base station router (BSR) flat Internet Protocol (IP) cellular architecture is presented that addresses these problems, and several aspects of the proposed solution are discussed. The overall concept and key requirements are presented in detail. The auto-configuration and self-optimization process from purchase by the end user to the integration into an existing macrocellular network is described. Then the theoretical performance of a co-channel femtocell deployment is analyzed and its impact on the macrocell underlay is assessed. Finally, a financial analysis of a femtocellular home base station deployment in a macrocellular network is presented. It is shown that in urban areas, the deployment of publicly accessible home base stations with slightly increased coverage can significantly reduce the operator's annual network costs (up to 70 percent in the investigated scenario) compared to a pure macrocellular network.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"Nokia Bell Labs","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6768783/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Spring  2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Spring  2008","publicationDate":"Spring 2008","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"30 April 2014","volume":"13","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"An overview of the femtocell concept","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An overview of the femtocell concept","sourcePdf":"6768783.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.015595S","chronDate":"Spring  2008","isNumber":"6768768","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6731002","citationCount":"220","articleId":"6768783","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"Bell Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6768813,"authors":[{"name":"Marc Lambert","firstName":"Marc","lastName":"Lambert"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"8756-2324"}],"articleNumber":"6768813","dbTime":"29 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":22},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6768813","doi":"10.1002/j.1538-7305.1994.tb00599.x","publicationTitle":"AT&T Technical Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"AT&T Technical Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/6731003/6768805/06768813.pdf","startPage":"56","endPage":"68","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1002/j.1538-7305.1994.tb00599.x","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6768805","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The BINOC project: A milestone for the operations systems business of AT&T","abstract":"The contract for a Belgian Integrated-Network Operations Center (BINOC) was signed in 1991.

We present a simple technique for controlling the energy on one side of the carrier of an FSK signal. The method entails modulating the amplitude of the FM wave in unison with the frequency. In other words, if the energy in the region above the carrier must be reduced, the envelope is somewhat suppressed while the higher frequency is transmitted. The proposed hybrid modulation technique is applicable in frequency-division multiplexed digital data transmission by FSK and can often ease the design of separation filters. Here we investigate this modulation technique theoretically as well as experimentally. Our theoretical results include closed-form formulas for the various power spectra of interest. We also determine the optimum amount of amplitude modulation to achieve the greatest amount of sidelobe energy suppression for a fixed amount of total average power. The experimental investigations substantiate the analysis, and we make comparisons of the technique with alternative approaches.","doi":"10.1002/j.1538-7305.1980.tb03022.x","publicationTitle":"The Bell System Technical Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"The Bell System Technical Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/6731005/6769013/06769017.pdf","startPage":"557","endPage":"570","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6769013","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1002/j.1538-7305.1980.tb03022.x","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spectral shaping by simultaneous amplitude and frequency modulation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6769017","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"Nokia Bell Labs","displayDocTitle":"Spectral shaping by simultaneous amplitude and frequency modulation","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6769017/","volume":"59","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 1980","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"30 April 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  1980","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April  1980","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spectral shaping by simultaneous amplitude and frequency modulation","sourcePdf":"bstj594557.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.019191S","chronDate":"April  1980","isNumber":"6769013","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6731005","citationCount":"1","articleId":"6769017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1980","subType":"Bell Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6769020,"authors":[{"name":"V.

Perfect channel knowledge is assumed, so that each receiver knows its own N \u00d7 M MIMO channel, and the transmitter knows all K MIMO channels. We propose a linear precoding and combining technique, called multi-user eigenmode transmission (MET), which uses a linear transmission strategy based on zero-forcing beamforming for maximizing the weighted sum rate. On a frame-by-frame basis, MET distributes up to M spatially multiplexed streams for one or more users. We show that the sum rate performance of a related zero-forcing strategy with receiver antenna selection scales optimally as the number of users K increases without bound. For the finite case of users with equal average signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), numerical simulations show that MET outperforms all previous linear techniques uniformly over a range of relevant SNRs. Numerical results for a conventional cellular network with three sectors per cell show that MET multi-user MIMO increases the median system throughput by about 40 percent compared to a baseline system using closed-loop single-user MIMO. We show how a novel MET architecture that coordinates antennas across co-located sectors nearly doubles the throughput of the baseline system with no additional radio frequency (RF) hardware.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A near-optimum precoding technique for downlink multi-user MIMO transmissions","publicationTitle":"Bell Labs Technical Journal","doi":"10.1002/bltj.20337","displayPublicationTitle":"Bell Labs Technical Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/6731002/6769023/06769028.pdf","startPage":"79","endPage":"95","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1002/bltj.20337","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6769023","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6769028","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"Nokia Bell Labs","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6769028/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Winter  2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Winter  2009","displayDocTitle":"A near-optimum precoding technique for downlink multi-user MIMO transmissions","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"13","issue":"4","dateOfInsertion":"30 April 2014","publicationDate":"Winter 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A near-optimum precoding technique for downlink multi-user MIMO transmissions","sourcePdf":"6769028.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.019955S","chronDate":"Winter  2009","isNumber":"6769023","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6731002","citationCount":"2","articleId":"6769028","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"Bell Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6769030,"authors":[{"name":"Yang Feng","affiliation":["Research and Innovation Center at Alcatel Shanghai Bell in Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Yang","lastName":"Feng"},{"name":"Song Yang","affiliation":["Research and Innovation Center at Alcatel Shanghai Bell in Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Song","lastName":"Yang"},{"name":"Qiu Jigang","affiliation":["Research and Innovation Center at Alcatel Shanghai Bell in Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Qiu","lastName":"Jigang"},{"name":"Xu Binyang","affiliation":["Research and Innovation Center at Alcatel Shanghai Bell in Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Xu","lastName":"Binyang"}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1538-7305"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7089"}],"articleNumber":"6769030","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":59},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6769030","doi":"10.1002/bltj.20339","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1002/bltj.20339","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6769023","publicationTitle":"Bell Labs Technical Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"Bell Labs Technical Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/6731002/6769023/06769030.pdf","startPage":"119","endPage":"128","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed spatial division multiple access technique for spectrum sharing systems","abstract":"Fourth generation (4G) systems will support co-deployment with other wireless networks based on different radio access technologies (RAT).

First, the cellular operators are considering femtocells deployed in indoor environments such as homes and enterprise buildings as a complement to macrocells for the purposes of enhancing capacity and coverage indoors. Second, standards such as Long Term Evolution (LTE), and Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access (WiMAX) are designing air interfaces that use increasingly wider bands of spectrum (e.g., up to 20 MHz per channel) to increase access rates. However, given the restricted size of operator licenses, the number of wideband channels is limited. As broadband wireless access gains adoption and media-rich end user devices (e.g., iPhones) proliferate, the next frontier will be ultra-broadband wireless access which inevitably needs more spectrum. Given end users often spend 40 percent of their time indoors, femtocells may be the first user equipment to offer such ultra-broadband access. In this paper, we propose a novel way to enable such ultra-broadband femtocells by opportunistically accessing wider swaths of spectrum. Our solution is based on three new concepts\u2014intra-operator spectrum white space reuse, multi-operator spectrum sharing, and multi-service spectrum reuse\u2014which exploit the spectrum of multiple cellular operators and of multiple non-cellular services such as digital television (DTV) broadcasts in femtocells deployed in a relatively isolated indoor environment. We describe an end-to-end architecture consisting of four main components: a multi-operator spectrum server (MOSS), a femto coordination/controller server (FCS), a cognitive femto base station, and associated end user devices that support a new air interface operating in non-contiguous spectrum bands. We also describe application of our concepts and solutions in the context of refarming the Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) spectrum worldwide to enable smooth evolution of GSM to third generation (3G) LTE standards.","doi":"10.1002/bltj.20340","publicationTitle":"Bell Labs Technical Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"Bell Labs Technical Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/6731002/6769023/06769031.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1002/bltj.20340","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6769023","startPage":"129","endPage":"143","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Ultra-broadband femtocells via opportunistic reuse of multi-operator and multi-service spectrum","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6769031","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"Nokia Bell Labs","displayDocTitle":"Ultra-broadband femtocells via opportunistic reuse of multi-operator and multi-service spectrum","chronOrPublicationDate":"Winter  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6769031/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Winter  2009","isJournal":true,"volume":"13","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Winter 2009","dateOfInsertion":"30 April 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ultra-broadband femtocells via opportunistic reuse of multi-operator and multi-service spectrum","sourcePdf":"6769031.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.020189S","chronDate":"Winter  2009","isNumber":"6769023","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6731002","citationCount":"10","articleId":"6769031","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"Bell Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":6769033,"authors":[{"name":"Federico Boccardi","affiliation":["Bell Labs in Swindon, United Kingdom"],"firstName":"Federico","lastName":"Boccardi"},{"name":"Kai Yu","affiliation":["Bell Labs Research in Swindon, United Kingdom"],"firstName":"Kai","lastName":"Yu"},{"name":"Angeliki Alexiou","affiliation":["Bell Labs Wireless Research Department in Swindon, United Kingdom"],"firstName":"Angeliki","lastName":"Alexiou"}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1538-7305"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7089"}],"articleNumber":"6769033","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":49},"abstract":"We present a novel approach for relay transmissions with multiple antennas using a decode and forward policy. The basic idea is to route the data by sending multiple independent spatial data streams directly to the destination and to different relays and then collect them at the destination. The relays are selected using an opportunistic approach in order to obtain the \u201cmulti-relay\u201d diversity gain. Another factor of the gain is due to the fact that by splitting the streams between different relays, the effective degrees of freedom of the channel are not limited by the rank of a single link channel.

By breaking a long distance low quality link into two or more high quality segments, multi-hop relay is introduced to enable traffic/signaling forwarding between the base station and mobile user. Coverage is effectively extended to heavily shadowed areas in the cell or other distant areas beyond cell range by multi-hop relay. Meanwhile, it also provides throughput enhancement, especially at the cell edge. This paper first reviews the key technical advances with multi-hop relay in cellular networks. Then, novel technical solutions and algorithms for multi-hop relay are introduced and analyzed, including the separation of control and data, effective signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR)-based routing algorithms, and cooperative relay schemes. Through extensive system-level and link-level simulations, we present improvements in both capacity and coverage in multi-hop relay networks compared to the legacy cellular network.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6769023","publicationTitle":"Bell Labs Technical Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"Bell Labs Technical Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/6731002/6769023/06769034.pdf","doi":"10.1002/bltj.20343","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1002/bltj.20343","startPage":"175","endPage":"193","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-hop relay for next-generation wireless access networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"Nokia Bell Labs","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Winter  2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Winter  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6769034/","displayDocTitle":"Multi-hop relay for next-generation wireless access networks","isJournal":true,"volume":"13","issue":"4","dateOfInsertion":"30 April 2014","publicationDate":"Winter 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-hop relay for next-generation wireless access networks","sourcePdf":"6769034.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.114861S","chronDate":"Winter  2009","isNumber":"6769023","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6731002","citationCount":"18","articleId":"6769034","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"Bell Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6769072,"authors":[{"name":"M.

This paper is concerned with fast distributed restoration and provisioning for generic mesh-based optical networks. We consider two problems of practical importance: determining the best restoration route for each wavelength demand, given the network topology and the capacities and primary routes of all demands, and determining primary and restoration routes for each wavelength demand to minimize network capacity and cost. The approach we propose for both problems is based on precomputing. For each problem, we describe specific algorithms used for computing routes. We also describe endpoint-based failure detection, message flows, and cross-connect actions for execution of fast restorations. Finally, we report test results for large carrier-scale networks that include both the computational performance of the optimization algorithms and the restoration speed obtained by simulation. Our results indicate that subsecond restoration, high capacity efficiency, and scalability can be achieved without fault isolation and with moderate processing. We also discuss methods for scaling algorithms to problems with very large numbers of demands. The wavelength routing and restoration algorithms, the failure detection, and the message exchange and activation architectures we propose are collectively known as WaveStar\u2122 advanced routing platform.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optical network design and restoration","publicationTitle":"Bell Labs Technical Journal","doi":"10.1002/bltj.2147","displayPublicationTitle":"Bell Labs Technical Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/6731002/6769120/06769124.pdf","startPage":"58","endPage":"84","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1002/bltj.2147","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6769120","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6769124","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"Nokia Bell Labs","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6769124/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.-March  1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.-March  1999","displayDocTitle":"Optical network design and restoration","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"4","issue":"1","dateOfInsertion":"30 April 2014","publicationDate":"Jan.-March 1999","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optical network design and restoration","sourcePdf":"2147ftp.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.056305S","chronDate":"Jan.-March  1999","isNumber":"6769120","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6731002","citationCount":"108","articleId":"6769124","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"Bell Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6769134,"authors":[{"name":"Neil A.

For any given transmission rate, the prefilter and sampling rate can be varied to yield a tradeoff between the edge busyness and the rise time associated with a video transition. A narrower prefilter results in less edge busyness but slower rise times and vice versa. Similarly, varying the sampling rate implies an inverse variation in the number of bits per sample allowed in the quantizer, which leads to a tradeoff between aliasing and quantizing noise, both of which are components of the edge busyness phenomenon. This paper shows in detail how the prefilter, sampler, and quantizer affect both edge busyness and rise time, and optimizes the intraframe coder design as a function of transmission rate from an analysis of this two-factor tradeoff.","doi":"10.1002/j.1538-7305.1973.tb01975.x","publicationTitle":"The Bell System Technical Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"The Bell System Technical Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/6731005/6769197/06769200.pdf","startPage":"497","endPage":"525","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6769197","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1002/j.1538-7305.1973.tb01975.x","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Prefilters, sampling, and transmission rates for intraframe codecs for picturephone\u00ae service","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6769200","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"Nokia Bell Labs","displayDocTitle":"Prefilters, sampling, and transmission rates for intraframe codecs for picturephone\u00ae service","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6769200/","volume":"52","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 1973","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"30 April 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  1973","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April  1973","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Prefilters, sampling, and transmission rates for intraframe codecs for picturephone\u00ae service","sourcePdf":"bstj524497.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.015456S","chronDate":"April  1973","isNumber":"6769197","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6731005","articleId":"6769200","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1973","subType":"Bell Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6769202,"authors":[{"name":"S.

This is about 200 times as great as the permeability of the best iron for these low magnetizing fields. This high permeability is attendant upon proper heat treatment and also upon other factors among which is freedom from elastic strain. The presence of other elements than iron or nickel and specially carbon, reduces the permeability, but slight variations in heat treatment produce large changes compared with those due to small quantities of impurities. So far as discovered, other physical properties show no peculiarities at the composition which brings out the remarkable magnetic properties of permalloy.

RF MEMS has now entered its second generation; high-volume production of both contacting and non-contacting switches and filters (based on bulk acoustic waves) was ramped up worldwide starting in 2003. In first-generation RF MEMS, discrete components were developed to demonstrate RF performance and reliability, and low-cost, high-volume chip- and wafer-scale packaging eliminated the final barriers to high-volume production of discrete replacement components with MEMS. In this paper, we review the RF MEMS industry and the commercialization status of RF MEMS components. We also provide a detailed case study of mobile telephone basestations, demonstrating how RF MEMS can impact telecommunications. Finally, we look at research into third-generation RF MEMS and NEMS, in which integration, active devices, and new functionality will create opportunities for disruptive changes in RF subsystems, enabling such things as software-defined radio.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"Nokia Bell Labs","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Fall  2005","chronOrPublicationDate":"Fall  2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6769245/","volume":"10","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Fall 2005","dateOfInsertion":"30 April 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"RF MEMS and NEMS technology, devices, and applications","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"RF MEMS and NEMS technology, devices, and applications","sourcePdf":"6769245.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.029297S","chronDate":"Fall  2005","isNumber":"6769242","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6731002","citationCount":"8","articleId":"6769245","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"Bell Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6769246,"authors":[{"name":"Daniel L\u00f3pez","affiliation":["Nanofabrication Research Group at Bell Labs in Murray Hill, New Jersey"],"firstName":"Daniel","lastName":"L\u00f3pez"},{"name":"Ricardo S.

The digital modulation methods considered are noncoherent frequency shift keying and coherent phase shift keying. Ideal selection combining and ideal maximal ratio combining diversity techniques are employed when the transmission is over fading channels. Weighting System 1 is the conventional weighted pulse code modulated system, where the bits in every PCM word have the same weighting profile.

For Rayleigh fading channels and the encoder operating at an input level that provided maximum signal-to-quantization noise-ratio, we obtained gains in overall signal-to-noise ratio (s/n) over unweighted \u03bc-law PCM of 3, 4.5, and 6 dB for Systems 1, 2, and 3, respectively. When the systems were used in conjunction with Gaussian channels, the corresponding gains were 10, 12, and 17 dB, for a channel s/n of 10 dB. In addition to the theoretical results, we conducted computer simulations using four concatenated speech sentences transmitted via our weighted \u03bc-law PCM systems over mobile radio channels. The simulation performances were in good agreement with our theoretical results, which were based on input signals having an exponential distribution.","publicationTitle":"AT&T Bell Laboratories Technical Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"AT&T Bell Laboratories Technical Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/6731004/6769272/06769276.pdf","startPage":"587","endPage":"626","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Weighting strategies for companded PCM transmitted over Rayleigh fading and Gaussian channels","doi":"10.1002/j.1538-7305.1984.tb00022.x","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6769272","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1002/j.1538-7305.1984.tb00022.x","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6769276","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"Nokia Bell Labs","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6769276/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April  1984","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  1984","displayDocTitle":"Weighting strategies for companded PCM transmitted over Rayleigh fading and Gaussian channels","dateOfInsertion":"30 April 2014","publicationDate":"April 1984","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"63","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Weighting strategies for companded PCM transmitted over Rayleigh fading and Gaussian channels","sourcePdf":"bstj634587.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.046033S","chronDate":"April  1984","isNumber":"6769272","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6731004","citationCount":"2","articleId":"6769276","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1984","subType":"Bell Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6769277,"authors":[{"name":"L.

The initial experiments with an HMM word recognizer were restricted to a vocabulary of 10 digits. For this simple vocabulary with dialed-up telephone recordings, we found that a high-performance, speaker-independent word recognizer could be implemented, and that the performance was, for the most part, insensitive to parameters of both the HMM and the VQ. In this paper we extend our investigations of the HMM recognizer to the recognition of isolated words from a medium-size vocabulary (129 words), as used in the AT&T Bell Laboratories airlines reservation and information system. For this moderately complex word vocabulary, we have found that recognition accuracy is indeed a function of the HMM parameters (i.e., the number of states in the model and the number of symbols per state). We have also found that a VQ that includes energy information gives better performance than a conventional VQ of the same size (i.e., same number of code-book entries).","doi":"10.1002/j.1538-7305.1984.tb00023.x","publicationTitle":"AT&T Bell Laboratories Technical Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"AT&T Bell Laboratories Technical Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/6731004/6769272/06769277.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1002/j.1538-7305.1984.tb00023.x","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6769272","startPage":"627","endPage":"642","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the use of hidden Markov models for speaker-independent recognition of isolated words from a medium-size vocabulary","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6769277","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"Nokia Bell Labs","displayDocTitle":"On the use of hidden Markov models for speaker-independent recognition of isolated words from a medium-size vocabulary","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  1984","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6769277/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April  1984","isJournal":true,"volume":"63","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 1984","dateOfInsertion":"30 April 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the use of hidden Markov models for speaker-independent recognition of isolated words from a medium-size vocabulary","sourcePdf":"bstj634627.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.029052S","chronDate":"April  1984","isNumber":"6769272","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6731004","citationCount":"13","articleId":"6769277","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1984","subType":"Bell Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6769279,"authors":[{"name":"K.

In reception, each array element feeds a pilot signal and the modulated signal to a third-order mixer wherein the phase associated with the signal in that element is automatically cancelled. This allows in-phase addition of the contributions from the many elements irrespective of the array shape or the direction of the incoming signal. For transmission, a pilot signal received from the distant receiver location provides by intermodulation a phase compensation to the signal radiated from each transmitting element so as to automatically direct the radiated signal to the distant receiver. There are no significant restrictions as to the shape of the array or the frequencies used. The scheme lends itself to multiple-element, low-power circuitry and may be used in either space or terrestrial systems to give a high repeater directivity without requiring stabilized platforms or control of antenna orientation.

A general method is given for synthesizing an infinite number of classes of band-limited orthogonal time functions in a limited frequency band. Stated in practical terms, the method permits the synthesis of a large class of practical transmitting filter characteristics for an arbitrarily given amplitude characteristic of the transmission medium. Rectangular-shaped ideal filters are not required. The synthesis procedure is convenient. Furthermore, the amplitude and the phase characteristics of the transmitting filters can be synthesized independently. Adaptive correlation reception can be used for data processing, since the received signals remain orthogonal no matter what the phase distortion is in the transmission medium. The system provides the same signal distance protection against channel noises as if the signals of each channel were transmitted through an independent medium and intersymbol interference in each channel were eliminated by reducing data rate.","doi":"10.1002/j.1538-7305.1966.tb02435.x","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6769436","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1002/j.1538-7305.1966.tb02435.x","publicationTitle":"The Bell System Technical Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"The Bell System Technical Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/6731005/6769436/06769442.pdf","startPage":"1775","endPage":"1796","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Synthesis of band-limited orthogonal signals for multichannel data transmission","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"Nokia Bell Labs","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1966","displayDocTitle":"Synthesis of band-limited orthogonal signals for multichannel data transmission","volume":"45","issue":"10","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1966","dateOfInsertion":"30 April 2014","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 1966","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6769442/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Synthesis of band-limited orthogonal signals for multichannel data transmission","sourcePdf":"bstj45101775.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.032977S","chronDate":"Dec.  1966","isNumber":"6769436","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6731005","citationCount":"439","articleId":"6769442","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1966","subType":"Bell Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6769447,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Unfortunately, quantitative results for the long pulse sequences of interest are difficult to come by due to the prohibitive amount of computer time required to carry out the iterations. We have found a simple approximate procedure that breaks the computational bottle-neck in all cases of practical interest.

AT&T's design and engineering community is active in both fields. DFR is introduced as part of a broader design for environment (DFE) program. In addition, there are ambitious initiatives to find suitable internal uses for plastics recyclate, which AT&T's material reclamation organizations have produced from scrapped telephone housings for many years. These two programs are symbiotic: The greater the number of products designed for recycling, the greater the amount of high-value materials that can be readily recovered from them at the end of their useful lives. In turn, the higher the quality of the recycled materials, the easier to recycle those materials into new products. This paper describes strategies for DFR applicable to plastic parts and discusses two initial applications of post-consumer recycled plastics in new AT&T products.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"Nokia Bell Labs","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.-Dec.  1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.-Dec.  1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6769551/","volume":"74","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov.-Dec. 1995","dateOfInsertion":"30 April 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Designing with plastics: Considering part recyclability and the use of recycled materials","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Designing with plastics: Considering part recyclability and the use of recycled materials","sourcePdf":"bstj74654.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.027831S","chronDate":"Nov.-Dec.  1995","isNumber":"6769543","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6731003","articleId":"6769551","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"Bell Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6769558,"authors":[{"name":"L.

Third, anomaly detection is performed on raw network observables \u2014 for example, performance data such as management information base-2 (MIB2) and remote monitor-1/2 (RMON1/2) variables \u2014 and algebraic functions of these observables (objective functions), thereby enabling objective-driven anomaly detection of wide range and high sensitivity.

These studies have been largely qualitative, rather than quantitative, in nature. The magnitude of the interference between a satellite system and ground system, however, depends greatly on the frequency plans involved, the character and degree of modulation used, and the parameters of the equipment. Bell Telephone Laboratories has under construction experimental satellite equipment designed to operate in the heavily used 4- and 6-kmc common carrier bands, and the present paper is directed to the potential interference between this satellite equipment and ground point-to-point systems. Interference involving a satellite station and the TD-2 and TH systems is analyzed specifically, and it is shown that the separation between systems must be of the order of 100 to 120 miles or more when the antenna of the common carrier transmitter or receiver is pointed directly at the satellite ground station. If the antenna is beamed 90 degrees or more from the satellite site, the minimum distance may be of the order of 10 miles even when line-of-sight propagation exists between locations. This assumes the use of the Bell System's horn-reflector antenna on the terrestrial system. With a parabolic dish antenna the latter distance must be increased to about 40 miles and adequate blocking must exist in the interference path. These distances provide adequate freedom from mutual interference for both telephone and television modulating signals.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Interference between satellite communication systems and common carrier surface systems","publicationTitle":"The Bell System Technical Journal","doi":"10.1002/j.1538-7305.1962.tb00483.x","displayPublicationTitle":"The Bell System Technical Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/6731005/6769599/06769606.pdf","startPage":"921","endPage":"943","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1002/j.1538-7305.1962.tb00483.x","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6769599","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6769606","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"Nokia Bell Labs","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6769606/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1962","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1962","displayDocTitle":"Interference between satellite communication systems and common carrier surface systems","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"41","issue":"3","dateOfInsertion":"30 April 2014","publicationDate":"May 1962","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Interference between satellite communication systems and common carrier surface systems","sourcePdf":"bstj413921.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.029426S","chronDate":"May  1962","isNumber":"6769599","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6731005","citationCount":"3","articleId":"6769606","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1962","subType":"Bell Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6769676,"authors":[{"name":"Robert S.

A derivation of the receiver parameters is presented, based on a gradient algorithm for jointly optimizing the equalizer tap coefficients and the carrier phase estimate, to minimize the output mean-squared error.

This growth has been achieved both by increases in individual channel rates, which are based on time division multiplexing (TDM), and by increased channel counts, through the use of dense wavelength division multiplexing (DWDM). Yet increasing optical transport capacity alone is insufficient to scale the network; the underlying data needs to be delivered from numerous geographically diverse originating locations to similarly diverse terminating locations, requiring increasing switching capacity to facilitate this networking need. Since the growth in the individual TDM channel rates is driven by the capabilities of electronics, it is reasonable to expect that the switching capacity of electronics will tend to track this trend, although because of the challenges in high data rate interconnects it is unlikely to exceed it. This leaves the challenge of managing the increased bandwidth attained through the use of DWDM. Management of this bandwidth in the optical layer is an attractive proposition if eliminating unnecessary high-speed electronics in the path of an optical signal can reduce the complexity of the network and the associated equipment costs. These optical bandwidth management elements are classified according to the degree of switching, as either reconfigurable optical add/drop multiplexers (ROADM) or wavelength selective cross-connects (WSXC), analogous to the add/drop multiplexers and digital cross-connects of the TDM domain. We generalize these elements and describe whether the switching provides functions that are multicolored, colorless, or colored, and whether the channels are fixed data rate or rateless. We review the wavelength selective switch (WSS) components that perform the necessary switching function and present two successful technology platforms that can be used to construct them: planar lightwave circuits (PLC) and micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS). We also discuss future directions for WSS technologies and device functionality to more flexibly manage bandwidth in the optical layer.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"Nokia Bell Labs","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6769747/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Summer  2006","chronOrPublicationDate":"Summer  2006","publicationDate":"Summer 2006","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"30 April 2014","volume":"11","issue":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Wavelength selective switching for optical bandwidth management","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wavelength selective switching for optical bandwidth management","sourcePdf":"6769747.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.054094S","chronDate":"Summer  2006","isNumber":"6769739","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6731002","citationCount":"10","articleId":"6769747","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"Bell Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6769757,"authors":[{"name":"Stewart E.

This guide is suitable for integrated optical circuitry because of its size, single-mode operation, mechanical stability, simplicity, and precise construction. After making some simplifying assumptions, we solve Maxwell's equations in closed form and find, that, because of total internal reflection, the guide supports two types of hybrid modes which are essentially of the TEM kind polarized at right angles. Their attenuations are comparable to that of a plane wave traveling in the material of which the rod is made. If the refractive indexes are chosen properly, the guide can support only the fundamental modes of each family with any aspect ratio of the guide cross section. By adding thin lossy layers, the guide presents higher loss to one of those modes. As an alternative, the guide can be made to support only one of the modes if part of the surrounding dielectrics is made a low impedance medium. Finally, we determine the coupling between parallel guiding rods of slightly different sizes and dielectrics; at wavelengths around one micron, 3-dB directional couplers, a few hundred microns long, can be achieved with separations of the guides about the same as their widths (a few microns).","publicationTitle":"The Bell System Technical Journal","startPage":"2071","endPage":"2102","doi":"10.1002/j.1538-7305.1969.tb01166.x","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1002/j.1538-7305.1969.tb01166.x","pdfPath":"/iel7/6731005/6769756/06769758.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"The Bell System Technical Journal","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6769756","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dielectric rectangular waveguide and directional coupler for integrated optics","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"Nokia Bell Labs","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6769758/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1969","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1969","displayDocTitle":"Dielectric rectangular waveguide and directional coupler for integrated optics","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"30 April 2014","publicationDate":"Sept. 1969","volume":"48","issue":"7","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dielectric rectangular waveguide and directional coupler for integrated optics","sourcePdf":"bstj4872071.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.024055S","chronDate":"Sept.  1969","isNumber":"6769756","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6731005","citationCount":"456","articleId":"6769758","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1969","subType":"Bell Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6769759,"authors":[{"name":"E.

The resulting formulas can also be used for uniform DPCM and PCM coders. The idle-channel spectrum consists of discrete lines which scatter somewhat irregularly in amplitude and frequency; they can be regarded as the result of sampling (aliasing) a sawtooth wave. These lines are phase-modulated by a coder input. For a sinusoidal input, discrete side frequencies are produced which again have an irregular progression of amplitudes. Gaussian inputs lead to gaussian line shapes; the lines broaden as input power is increased. A totally white spectrum (as is often assumed in connection with delta-modulation-system considerations) cannot be attained, however, before the onset of slope overload.

The model assumes a conversant to occupy one of three speaking or one of three silent states. Transitions among the states arc determined by Poisson processes governed by six parameters (one for each state). The validity of the model is tested by comparing the model computer simulation of 16 conversations with 16 real conversations. Cumulative distribution functions are compared for ten events (such as talkspurts, pauses, mutual silences, and so on) defined on the speech patterns. The model yields good fits to all events except \u201cspeech before interruption;\u201d when an interruption occurs, a model speaker tends to interrupt the other's talkspurt later than a real speaker does. Theoretical behavior of the model is also studied. All events consist of concatenations of exponentially distributed \u201cstate durations,\u201d even though most events are not themselves exponential. For some purposes, the exponential distribution is a satisfactory empirical fit to talkspurts, but not to pauses. Possible applications of the model include studying people's motivations to talk and fall silent on different circuits, and predicting statistical behavior of voice operated devices on the circuits.","doi":"10.1002/j.1538-7305.1969.tb01181.x","startPage":"2445","publicationTitle":"The Bell System Technical Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"The Bell System Technical Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/6731005/6769756/06769773.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1002/j.1538-7305.1969.tb01181.x","endPage":"2472","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6769756","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A model for generating on-off speech patterns in two-way conversation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"Nokia Bell Labs","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6769773/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1969","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1969","displayDocTitle":"A model for generating on-off speech patterns in two-way conversation","volume":"48","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"30 April 2014","publicationDate":"Sept. 1969","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A model for generating on-off speech patterns in two-way conversation","sourcePdf":"bstj4872445.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.031222S","chronDate":"Sept.  1969","isNumber":"6769756","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6731005","citationCount":"295","articleId":"6769773","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1969","subType":"Bell Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6769784,"authors":[{"name":"Alfred V.

Our methodology employs a software system called the coordination-specification analyzer (COSPAN) to facilitate logical testing (in contrast to simulation or system execution testing). Logical testing of a communications protocol is carried out on a succession of models of the protocol. Starting with a high-level model (e.g., a formal abstraction of a protocol standard), successively more refined (detailed) models are created. This succession ends with a low-level model which is in fact the code that runs the ultimate implementation of the protocol. Tests of successive models are defined not by test vectors, but by user-defined behavioral requirements appropriate to the given level of abstraction. Testing a high-level design permits early detection and correction of design errors. Successive refinement is carried out in a fashion that guarantees properties proved at one level of abstraction hold in all successive levels of abstraction. We recount the experience of an application of this methodology, employing COSPAN, to develop (analyze and implement in software) a new session protocol at an interface of an AT&T product called the Trunk Operations Provisioning Administration System (TOPAS).","publicationTitle":"AT&T Technical Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"AT&T Technical Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/6731003/6769782/06769788.pdf","startPage":"45","endPage":"59","doi":"10.1002/j.1538-7305.1990.tb00102.x","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1002/j.1538-7305.1990.tb00102.x","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6769782","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Software for analytical development of communications protocols","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"Nokia Bell Labs","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6769788/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.-Feb.  1990","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.-Feb.  1990","displayDocTitle":"Software for analytical development of communications protocols","publicationDate":"Jan.-Feb. 1990","dateOfInsertion":"30 April 2014","isJournal":true,"volume":"69","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Software for analytical development of communications protocols","sourcePdf":"bstj69145.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.021688S","chronDate":"Jan.-Feb.  1990","isNumber":"6769782","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6731003","citationCount":"27","articleId":"6769788","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"Bell Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6769835,"authors":[{"name":"Morimi Iwama","affiliation":["University of California at Berkeley"],"firstName":"Morimi","lastName":"Iwama"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"8756-2324"}],"articleNumber":"6769835","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":55},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6769835","doi":"10.1002/j.1538-7305.1994.tb00614.x","publicationTitle":"AT&T Technical Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"AT&T Technical Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/6731003/6769833/06769835.pdf","startPage":"4","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1002/j.1538-7305.1994.tb00614.x","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6769833","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"AT&T switching systems: An overview","abstract":"The state of switching in AT&T reflects the state of the business in telecommunications. Both have been transformed by the effects of globalization, deregulation, the merging of technologies and industries, and the growing demand for customized solutions and rapid response to customer needs. When AT&T installed the first 5ESS\u00ae digital switch in 1982, the role of that state-of-the-art system was local switching of voice over wireline loops. Today, the traffic handled by the 5ESS switch includes data, graphic images, and video as well as voice, and the system's role has broadened to include local/toll, operator services, international gateway, intelligent network, and wireless communications applications. Another instance of an industry trend reflected directly in AT&T switching is the GlobeView\u2122 \u2014 2000 Broadband System, the asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) system introduced by AT&T in 1993. ATM embodies the merging of computer and communications technology, and it enables network providers to meet the new demands of converging markets by handling high-quality video, highspeed data, multimedia, and voice on a single platform.

Waste disposal problems associated with the detergent have been alleviated by \u201csemi-aqueous\u201d underbrush cleaning that uses an emulsion of water and a naturally-derived terpene hydrocarbon solvent. Improved surface insulation resistance of aggressive water soluble fluxes has allowed aqueous cleaning for products compatible with total immersion. Low solids, no-clean fluxes that leave minimal residue have eliminated the cleaning step for many products. For surface mount applications, where underbrush cleaning is not applicable, spray cleaning with terpene followed by water rinse has proven effective. Safety concerns about spray flammability and low flash temperature have been resolved, and excellent cleaning results have been obtained with a production machine running at AT&T's Merrimack Valley facility.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6769860","publicationTitle":"AT&T Technical Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"AT&T Technical Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/6731003/6769860/06769867.pdf","doi":"10.1002/j.1538-7305.1992.tb00157.x","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1002/j.1538-7305.1992.tb00157.x","startPage":"45","endPage":"51","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Aqueous and semi-aqueous cleaning processes","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"Nokia Bell Labs","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March-April  1992","chronOrPublicationDate":"March-April  1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6769867/","displayDocTitle":"Aqueous and semi-aqueous cleaning processes","isJournal":true,"volume":"71","issue":"2","dateOfInsertion":"30 April 2014","publicationDate":"March-April 1992","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Aqueous and semi-aqueous cleaning processes","sourcePdf":"bstj71245.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044103S","chronDate":"March-April  1992","isNumber":"6769860","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6731003","citationCount":"3","articleId":"6769867","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"Bell Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6769926,"authors":[{"name":"D.

Subsequently, a frequency domain harmonic scaling technique is studied in detail with emphasis on improving its performance and its implementation efficiency. This technique is particularly attractive for 2:1 scaling by use of a sign tracking algorithm which avoids the need for explicit phase computation and unwrapping. The implementation efficiency is achieved by using the fast Fourier transform algorithm, embedded decimation and interpolation, and an extended version of a recently developed weighted overlap-add synthesis scheme. The improvement in quality is achieved by improved sign tracking and elaborate design and selection of the analysis and synthesis prototype filters (data windows). Results of computer simulations, for a variety of adverse acoustical environment conditions, indicate that the system is highly robust but its quality for clean speech is lower than with a time domain harmonic scaling technique which uses pitch information. In applications which do not permit pitch transmission, a hybrid scheme which combines the two techniques is found to yield a better quality than either system alone.","displayPublicationTitle":"The Bell System Technical Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/6731005/6769920/06769926.pdf","startPage":"2107","endPage":"2156","publicationTitle":"The Bell System Technical Journal","doi":"10.1002/j.1538-7305.1981.tb00313.x","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1002/j.1538-7305.1981.tb00313.x","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6769920","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6769926","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Frequency scaling of speech signals by transform techniques","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"Nokia Bell Labs","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6769926/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1981","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1981","displayDocTitle":"Frequency scaling of speech signals by transform techniques","volume":"60","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 1981","dateOfInsertion":"30 April 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Frequency scaling of speech signals by transform techniques","sourcePdf":"bstj6092107.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.027472S","chronDate":"Nov.  1981","isNumber":"6769920","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6731005","citationCount":"6","articleId":"6769926","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1981","subType":"Bell Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6769959,"authors":[{"name":"W.

The weight of a vector is the number of its nonzero coordinates; clearly any given code contains a certain finite number of vectors of each weight from zero to n. This set of integers is called the spectrum of the code, and very little is known about it, although it appears to be important both mathematically and as a practical means of evaluating the error-detecting properties of the code. In this paper it is shown that the spectrum of a systematic code determines uniquely the spectrum of its dual code (the orthogonal vector space). In fact the two sets of integers are related by a system of linear equations. Consequently there is a set of conditions which must be satisfied by the weights which actually occur in a systematic code. If there is enough other information about the code, it is possible to use this result to calculate its spectrum.","doi":"10.1002/j.1538-7305.1963.tb04003.x","publicationTitle":"The Bell System Technical Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"The Bell System Technical Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/6731005/6769957/06769961.pdf","startPage":"79","endPage":"94","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1002/j.1538-7305.1963.tb04003.x","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6769957","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A theorem on the distribution of weights in a systematic code","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"Nokia Bell Labs","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1963","displayDocTitle":"A theorem on the distribution of weights in a systematic code","volume":"42","issue":"1","dateOfInsertion":"30 April 2014","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 1963","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6769961/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1963","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A theorem on the distribution of weights in a systematic code","sourcePdf":"bstj42179.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.040159S","chronDate":"Jan.  1963","isNumber":"6769957","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6731005","citationCount":"97","articleId":"6769961","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1963","subType":"Bell Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6769983,"authors":[{"name":"E.
