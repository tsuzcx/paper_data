These current limits determine the stable operating range of the NPC converter in applications that impose a nonzero average NP current, like- NPC converters feeding multiterminal dc loads, back-to-back-connected NPC converter-based wind and high voltage dc transmission systems, etc. Previously, a dual-mode modulation technique was implemented in the literature which provided the maximum average NP current limits without considering the ZSV effect. As the ZSV injection affects the NP duty cycles, and in turn the NP current, it is necessary to analyze and quantify its effect. In this paper, the effect of ZSV on the current limits is analytically calculated. Simulation results are obtained in MATLAB/Simulink environment to validate the derived analytical equations.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9589036","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IECON48115.2021.9590005","publicationTitle":"IECON 2021 \u2013 47th Annual Conference of the IEEE

The validity of the data is questionable. There have been many models that have been applied to facial recognition-based attendance systems. However, this model needs much training data so that the model's accuracy is high. In this study, a modification of the deep neural network model for the attendance system is proposed that can work on a small amount of training data. The proposed model is a modification of the DenseNet201 model with batch normalization and average pooling layer. Even though our model's training time is quite long, this model modification can achieve the highest accuracy value of about 90% compared to other pre-trained models, namely ResNet50 and MobileNet.","doi":"10.1109/ICITech50181.2021.9590155","startPage":"64","endPage":"68","publicationTitle":"2021 2nd International Conference on Innovative and Creative Information Technology (ICITech)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICITech50181.2021.9590155","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9590100","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 2nd International Conference on Innovative and Creative Information Technology (ICITech)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9588928/9590100/09590155.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Application of Deep Neural Network Modifications for Face Recognition in Attendance Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9590155/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Application of Deep Neural Network Modifications for Face Recognition in Attendance Systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9590155/","publicationDate":"23 Sept. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2021","conferenceDate":"23-25 Sept. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 Sept. 2021","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100005980","fundingName":"The Ministry of Education and Culture, Indonesia","grantNumber":"1867/EAlAK.04/2021,067/E4.1/AK.04.PT/2021"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Application of Deep Neural Network Modifications for Face Recognition in Attendance Systems","confLoc":"Salatiga, Indonesia","sourcePdf":"12-Lestari-2021217245.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068052S","chronDate":"23-25 Sept. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9588928","isNumber":"9590100","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9588928","xplore-issue":"9590100","articleId":"9590155","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":9590174,"authors":[{"name":"Nazmus Shakib Shadin","affiliation":["Ahsanullah University of Science and Technology, Dhaka, Bangladesh"],"firstName":"Nazmus Shakib","lastName":"Shadin","id":"37088922026"},{"name":"Silvia Sanjana","affiliation":["Ahsanullah University of Science and Technology, Dhaka, Bangladesh"],"firstName":"Silvia","lastName":"Sanjana","id":"37088920633"},{"name":"Mayisha Farzana","affiliation":["Ahsanullah University of Science and Technology, Dhaka, Bangladesh"],"firstName":"Mayisha","lastName":"Farzana","id":"37089025970"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-9747-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-9748-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9590174","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":21},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["COVID-19","Pandemics","Pulmonary diseases","Lung","Coronaviruses","Convolutional neural networks","Information technology"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["COVID-19","CNN","Pneumonia","Deep Learning","Chest X-ra","Max pooling","Average pooling"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9590174","doi":"10.1109/ICITech50181.2021.9590174","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICITech50181.2021.9590174","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9590100","publicationTitle":"2021 2nd International Conference on Innovative and Creative Information Technology (ICITech)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 2nd International Conference on Innovative and Creative Information Technology (ICITech)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9588928/9590100/09590174.pdf","startPage":"57","endPage":"63","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Automated Detection of COVID-19 Pneumonia and Non COVID-19 Pneumonia from Chest X-ray Images Using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)","abstract":"SARS-CoV-2 has now spread to nearly every part of the world, with the WHO declaring a pandemic because of its rapid spread. One of the diagnostic procedures used to detect the extent of the COVID-19 infection is Chest X-rays. Chest Xrays are commonly used to diagnose lung disorders in the beginning. To improve the accuracy of the computer- aided diagnosis system, a research study assessed how well it can correctly distinguish between non-COVID-19 pneumonia on chest X-ray (CXR) images and COVID-19 pneumonia with the alliance of Artificial Intelligence. COVID-19 pneumonia patients (those that tested positive for COVID-19 antibodies) and non- COVID-19 pneumonia patients (those who did not test positive for COVID-19 antibodies) were included in the analysis. The research was conducted using a standard dataset containing 1563 lung CT scan images of COVID-19 pneumonia and non-COVID-19 pneumonia (virus) patients' samples.

Previous studies utilize user interest features and POI spatial information to provide travel route recommendation service. However, most of them fail to consider the implicit information in user traveling patterns, which is the key to improve recommendation quality. Additionally, few deep learning based travel route recommendation systems provide comprehensive trip planning functionalities, which is critical to improve the user experience. To alleviate these two problems, we propose a multi-functional attention-based neural network for route recommendation (named MatTrip). We first introduce an encoder-decoder structure with a novel dual bi-directional LSTM encoder as the sequence generation model to learn other users' traveling records and generates a semantic travel route based on user preference and geographical features of start/end POI. Next, multiple user-specific functionalities are supported in MatTrip by grid beam search. The functionalities include weather dependency, POI opening hours, restricted sequence length, mandatory POIs, and dynamic route revision. In addition, MatTrip adopts an online learning approach to learn from user deviation behaviors to improve recommendation performance. Experiments on two real-world datasets show that our model achieves a 20.98% improvement in performance, compared with state-of-arts.","doi":"10.1109/ICWS53863.2021.00030","startPage":"145","endPage":"154","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Conference on Web Services (ICWS)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICWS53863.2021.00030","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9590192","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Conference on Web Services (ICWS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9590196/9590192/09590246.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MatTrip: Multi-functional Attention-based Neural Network for Semantic Travel Route Recommendation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9590246/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"MatTrip: Multi-functional Attention-based Neural Network for Semantic Travel Route Recommendation","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9590246/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2021","conferenceDate":"5-10 Sept. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-10 Sept. 2021","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MatTrip: Multi-functional Attention-based Neural Network for Semantic Travel Route Recommendation","confLoc":"Chicago, IL, USA","sourcePdf":"168100a145.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.106231S","chronDate":"5-10 Sept. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9590196","isNumber":"9590192","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9590196","xplore-issue":"9590192","articleId":"9590246","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":9590300,"authors":[{"name":"Xin Wang","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, Wuhan University, China"],"firstName":"Xin","lastName":"Wang","id":"37088593164"},{"name":"Xiao Liu","affiliation":["School of Information Technology, Deakin University, Australia"],"firstName":"Xiao","lastName":"Liu","id":"37406542800"},{"name":"Jin Liu","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, Wuhan University, China"],"firstName":"Jin","lastName":"Liu","id":"37085407037"},{"name":"Hao Wu","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Engineering, Yunnan University, China"],"firstName":"Hao","lastName":"Wu","id":"37405487200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-1681-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-1682-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9590300","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":12},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Web services","Conferences","Ecosystems","Graph neural networks"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Bundle Recommendation","Relational Graph Neural Network","Neighbor Interaction","Multi-Task Learning"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9590300","abstract":"Bundle recommendation plays a crucial role in the service ecosystem. However, most existing bundle recommendation methods are limited in several critical aspects such as the lack of injecting different relations into the representations of bundles and items, and the ignorance of neighbor interactions. To address these limitations, in this paper, we propose a relational graph neural network with neighbor interactions for bundle recommendation. Specifically, we firstly construct two relational graphs, e.g., user-bundle-item interaction graph and bundle-item affiliation graph. We utilize a relational graph neural network to inject different relations into representations of bundles and items. Secondly, we consider neighbor interactions to highlight common properties of neighbors. Finally, a multi-task learning framework is also exploited to capture users' preferences at the item level to further enhance bundle recommendation performance. Comprehensive experiments on two real-world public datasets demonstrate that our proposed method can outperform various representative bundle recommendation methods.","doi":"10.1109/ICWS53863.2021.00033","startPage":"167","endPage":"172","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Conference on Web Services (ICWS)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICWS53863.2021.00033","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9590192","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Conference on Web Services (ICWS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9590196/9590192/09590300.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Relational Graph Neural Network with Neighbor Interactions for Bundle Recommendation Service","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9590300/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Relational Graph Neural Network with Neighbor Interactions for Bundle Recommendation Service","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9590300/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2021","conferenceDate":"5-10 Sept. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-10 Sept. 2021","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Relational Graph Neural Network with Neighbor Interactions for Bundle Recommendation Service","confLoc":"Chicago, IL, USA","sourcePdf":"168100a167.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052274S","chronDate":"5-10 Sept. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9590196","isNumber":"9590192","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9590196","xplore-issue":"9590192","articleId":"9590300","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":9590313,"authors":[{"name":"Jing Zhang","affiliation":["School of Software, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jing","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37085673915"},{"name":"Yang Chen","affiliation":["School of Software, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yang","lastName":"Chen","id":"37089029150"},{"name":"Yilong Yang","affiliation":["School of Software, Beihang University, Beijing, China","State Key Laboratory of Software Development Environment, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yilong","lastName":"Yang","id":"37088592989"},{"name":"Changran Lei","affiliation":["School of Software, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Changran","lastName":"Lei","id":"37089029805"},{"name":"Deqiang Wang","affiliation":["School of Software, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Deqiang","lastName":"Wang","id":"37655882400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-1681-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-1682-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9590313","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":13},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Deep learning","Web services","Conferences","Feature extraction"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Deep Learning","Service","Web Services","Service Classification","Long-tailed Distributions"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9590313","abstract":"Automatic service classification plays an important role in service discovery, selection, and composition. Recently, machine learning has been widely used in service classification. Though promising results are obtained, previous methods are merely evaluated on web services datasets with small-scale data and relatively balanced data, which limit their real-world applications. In this paper, we address the long-tailed web services classification problem with more categories and imbalanced data. Due to the long-tailed distribution of datasets, the existing machine learning and deep learning methods cannot work well. To deal with the long-tailed problem, we propose a normalized multi-head classifier learning strategy, which effectively reduces the classifier bias and benefit the generalization capacity of the extracted features. Extensive experiments are conducted on a large-scale long-tailed web services dataset, and the results show that our model outperforms the 11 compared service classification methods to a large margin.","doi":"10.1109/ICWS53863.2021.00025","startPage":"97","endPage":"106","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Conference on Web Services (ICWS)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICWS53863.2021.00025","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9590192","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Conference on Web Services (ICWS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9590196/9590192/09590313.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"ServeNet-LT: A Normalized Multi-head Deep Neural Network for Long-tailed Web Services Classification","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9590313/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"ServeNet-LT: A Normalized Multi-head Deep Neural Network for Long-tailed Web Services Classification","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9590313/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2021","conferenceDate":"5-10 Sept. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-10 Sept. 2021","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"62006012,61732019"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"ServeNet-LT: A Normalized Multi-head Deep Neural Network for Long-tailed Web Services Classification","confLoc":"Chicago, IL, USA","sourcePdf":"168100a097.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.09847S","chronDate":"5-10 Sept. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9590196","isNumber":"9590192","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9590196","xplore-issue":"9590192","articleId":"9590313","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":9590333,"authors":[{"name":"C.

For this purpose, a framework is proposed in this paper based on hierarchical agglomerative clustering along with geographical distance based cluster representation. The proposed framework helps remove the redundant nodes in a practical IoT network by choosing the optimal nodes based on the target reconstruction error in the spatially interpolated map. The approach is employed on the data collected by an IoT network of ten particulate matter (PM) nodes on the campus of IIIT Hyderabad, India. The performance of the proposed approach is also compared with that of the brute force approach, which provides the lower bound on the reconstruction error. The results show that the proposed approach performs very closely to the brute force approach in terms of the reconstruction error with much fewer computations.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Couplings","Measurement","Interpolation","Cloud computing","Force","Internet of Things","Task analysis"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Clustering Analysis","Cluster Representative","Optimal Nodes","Particulate Matter","Spatial Sampling"]}],"doi":"10.1109/FiCloud49777.2021.00036","publicationTitle":"2021 8th International Conference on Future Internet of Things and Cloud (FiCloud)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 8th International Conference on Future Internet of Things and Cloud (FiCloud)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9590197/9590190/09590333.pdf","startPage":"198","endPage":"203","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9590190","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FiCloud49777.2021.00036","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hierarchical Clustering based Spatial Sampling of Particulate Matter Nodes in IoT Network","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9590333","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Hierarchical Clustering based Spatial Sampling of Particulate Matter Nodes in IoT Network","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9590333/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9590333/","conferenceDate":"23-25 Aug. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 Aug. 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100008628","fundingName":"Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MEITY)","grantNumber":"3070665"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hierarchical Clustering based Spatial Sampling of Particulate Matter Nodes in IoT Network","confLoc":"Rome, Italy","sourcePdf":"257400a198.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039252S","chronDate":"23-25 Aug. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9590197","isNumber":"9590190","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9590197","xplore-issue":"9590190","articleId":"9590333","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-26"},{"_id":9590505,"authors":[{"name":"Zhuo Sun","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi\u2019an, China"],"firstName":"Zhuo","lastName":"Sun","orcid":"0000-0003-3115-278X","id":"37085773424"},{"name":"Nan Yang","affiliation":["College of Engineering and Computer Science, Australian National University, Canberra, ACT, Australia"],"firstName":"Nan","lastName":"Yang","orcid":"0000-0002-9373-5289","id":"37407136200"},{"name":"Chunhui Li","affiliation":["College of Engineering and Computer Science, Australian National University, Canberra, ACT, Australia"],"firstName":"Chunhui","lastName":"Li","orcid":"0000-0002-7737-7610","id":"37086915922"},{"name":"Jinhong Yuan","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Telecommunications, University of New South Wales, Sydney, NSW, Australia"],"firstName":"Jinhong","lastName":"Yuan","orcid":"0000-0002-5794-493X","id":"37281352700"},{"name":"Tony Q.

Explicitly, the pilots are directly transmitted over the time-frequency (TF)-domain grid for estimating the delay-Doppler (DD)-domain CSI that leads to a reduction of the pilot overhead, training duration and pre-processing complexity. Furthermore, it completely avoids placing multiple DD-domain guard intervals corresponding to each transmit antenna within the same OTFS frame, while keeping the training duration flexible, hence increasing the bandwidth efficiency. A unique benefit of the proposed CSI estimation model is that it can efficiently handle fractional Dopplers also. The resultant DD-domain CSI becomes simultaneously row and group (RG)-sparse. To exploit this compelling property, an orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP)-based RG-OMP technique is developed, conveniently complemented by an enhanced Bayesian learning (BL)-based RG-BL framework, both of which substantially outperform the state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, low-complexity linear detectors are designed for the ensuing data detection phase, which directly employ the estimated DD-domain sparse CSI, without assuming any further knowledge concerning the number of dominant multipath components. Finally, simulation results are provided to demonstrate performance improvement of the proposed BL-based schemes over the OMP and the state-of-the-art schemes.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2021.3123354","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/9681827/09590508.pdf","startPage":"635","endPage":"648","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9681827","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2021.3123354","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2022","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 October 2021","displayDocTitle":"Bayesian Learning Aided Simultaneous Row and Group Sparse Channel Estimation in Orthogonal Time Frequency Space Modulated MIMO Systems","volume":"70","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/9590508/","dateOfInsertion":"14 January 2022","publicationDate":"Jan. 2022","isJournal":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9590508/","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000266","fundingName":"Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council projects","grantNumber":"EP/P034284/1 and EP/P003990/1"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000781","fundingName":"European Research Council\u2019s Advanced Fellow Grant QuantCom","grantNumber":"789028"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001843","fundingName":"Science and Engineering Research Board (SERB), Department of Science and Technology, Government of India"},{"fundingName":"Space Technology Cell, IIT Kanpur"},{"fundingName":"IIMA IDEA Telecom Centre of Excellence"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100005144","fundingName":"Qualcomm Innovation Fellowship"},{"fundingName":"Arun Kumar Chair Professorship"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bayesian Learning Aided Simultaneous Row and Group Sparse Channel Estimation in Orthogonal Time Frequency Space Modulated MIMO Systems","sourcePdf":"tcomm-hanzo-3123354-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.100545S","chronDate":"Jan.  2022","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"9681827","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","xplore-issue":"9681827","articleId":"9590508","onlineDate":"27 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2022","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-23"},{"_id":9590509,"authors":[{"name":"Jia Ye","affiliation":["Computer, Electrical and Mathematical Science and Engineering Division, King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), Thuwal, Saudi Arabia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/9681827/9590509/ye-3123364-small.gif","p":["Jia Ye (Student Member, IEEE) was born in Chongqing, China.

Different from existing models, the compound channel model incorporates the effects of spreading loss, molecular absorption loss, shadowing, and multi-path fading via a composite distribution. By using this model, we maintain an equilibrium of the outage performance analysis between mathematical tractability and the fidelity of realistic THz channels. Specifically, by utilizing the compound channel model, outage performance analysis can get rid of sophisticated case-specific channel modeling relying on field measurement and the ray-tracing assessment. To facilitate the application of the proposed channel model, we also design a maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) based channel parameter estimation approach for the compound channel model. The analytical results of outage performance by using the compound channel model are given in closed form and verified by numerical results.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9590509/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 October 2021","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2022","volume":"70","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"14 January 2022","publicationDate":"Jan. 2022","htmlLink":"/document/9590509/","displayDocTitle":"On Outage Performance of Terahertz Wireless Communication Systems","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004052","fundingName":"KAUST Office of Sponsored Research"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On Outage Performance of Terahertz Wireless Communication Systems","sourcePdf":"tcomm-shihada-3123364-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.203383S","chronDate":"Jan.  2022","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"9681827","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","xplore-issue":"9681827","articleId":"9590509","onlineDate":"27 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2022","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-23"},{"_id":9590514,"authors":[{"name":"Runxin Zhou","affiliation":["College of Information Science and Technology, Jinan University, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Runxin","lastName":"Zhou","orcid":"0000-0001-5661-1888"},{"name":"Huiqin Du","affiliation":["College of Information Science and Technology, Jinan University, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Huiqin","lastName":"Du","orcid":"0000-0002-6612-3199"},{"name":"Duoying Zhang","affiliation":["College of Information Science and Technology, Jinan University, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Duoying","lastName":"Zhang","orcid":"0000-0001-9863-0868"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"9590514","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":65},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","MIMO communication","Quantization (signal)","Estimation","Upper bound","Sparse matrices","Scattering"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["One-bit quantization","mmWave","MIMO channel estimation"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9590514","doi":"10.1109/LCOMM.2021.3123368","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCOMM.2021.3123368","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9674048","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/4234/9674048/09590514.pdf","startPage":"158","endPage":"162","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Millimeter Wave MIMO Channel Estimation With One-Bit Receivers","abstract":"Receivers with one-bit analog-to-digital (ADC) converters are considered as a potential solution to reduce the power consumption and hardware complexity for millimeter wave (mmWave) multiple input multiple output systems. However, it is challenging to estimate the mmWave channel with one-bit ADCs because of significant distortions of received signal and a limited scattering nature. In this work, by exploiting the sparse and low-rank properties, we develop a mmWave channel estimation algorithm which can maximize the log-likelihoods under the rank and entry-wise infinity-norm constraints. Instead of using the convex relaxation for rank operation, matrix factorization is introduced to represent the exact rank constraint implicitly. The entry-wise infinity-norm is reformulated via the log-barrier method. The optimum estimation can be obtained iteratively via projected gradient ascent algorithm. Moreover, an upper bound performance of one-bit channel estimation is derived. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can obtain accurate estimation with relatively low computational complexity.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9590514/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2022","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 October 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9590514/","dateOfInsertion":"07 January 2022","publicationDate":"Jan. 2022","volume":"26","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Millimeter Wave MIMO Channel Estimation With One-Bit Receivers","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61871201"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100010256","fundingName":"Guangzhou Science and Technology Project","grantNumber":"33121089"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Millimeter Wave MIMO Channel Estimation With One-Bit Receivers","sourcePdf":"lcomm-zhang-3123368-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.062298S","chronDate":"Jan.  2022","xplore-pub-id":"4234","isNumber":"9674048","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4234","xplore-issue":"9674048","articleId":"9590514","onlineDate":"27 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2022","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-10"},{"_id":9590518,"authors":[{"name":"Su-In Yi","affiliation":["Texas A&M University, College Station, TX, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/9629436/9590518/yi-3119648-small.gif","p":["Su-In Yi received the Ph.D. degree in mechanical engineering from Texas A&M University.

However, it presents a very distinct bitline discharging behavior in these two modes, thus brings a significant challenge to the design of its sensing amplifiers. State-of-the-art sensing amplifiers, namely the symmetric single-ended sensing amplifier (SS-SA) and the asymmetric differential sensing amplifier (AD-SA), cannot support a high-speed compute access and normal read access at the same time. To solve this problem, first, we perform a comprehensive analysis of these two sensing topologies and find that AD-SA requires a smaller bitline voltage difference than that of SS-SA, but it is still relatively large. This guides us to design an improved AD-SA for high-speed compute access. Second, we propose a novel reconfigurable sensing amplifier (R-SA) that can dynamically reconfigure its circuits in a compute access or in normal read access, to optimize its access delay in both modes. Compared to the state-of-the-art, results show that our R-SA has reduced the access delay by 17% and 45% for compute access and normal access, respectively, in an 8 Kb compute SRAM using a 55 nm CMOS technology. In addition, the proposed R-SA also saves the access energy by 9%.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis and Design of Reconfigurable Sense Amplifier for Compute SRAM With High-Speed Compute and Normal Read Access","doi":"10.1109/TCSII.2021.3123512","endPage":"3507","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","pdfPath":"/iel7/8920/9624469/09590521.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","startPage":"3503","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSII.2021.3123512","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9624469","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9590521","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sensors","Voltage","Delays","Topology","Random access memory","Discharges (electric)","Transistors"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Sense amplifier","SRAM","in-memory computing","compute SRAM"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Analysis and Design of Reconfigurable Sense Amplifier for Compute SRAM With High-Speed Compute and Normal Read Access","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9590521/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 October 2021","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2021","volume":"68","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/9590521/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"23 November 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"62074101"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003399","fundingName":"Science and Technology Commission of Shanghai Municipality","grantNumber":"19511131203"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis and Design of Reconfigurable Sense Amplifier for Compute SRAM With High-Speed Compute and Normal Read Access","sourcePdf":"tcsii-ha-3123512-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.060564S","chronDate":"Dec.  2021","xplore-pub-id":"8920","isNumber":"9624469","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8920","xplore-issue":"9624469","articleId":"9590521","onlineDate":"27 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-27"},{"_id":9590543,"authors":[{"name":"Yulin Shao","affiliation":["Imperial College London (ICL), London, U.K."],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/9681827/9590543/shao-3123362-small.gif","p":["Yulin Shao (Member, IEEE) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees (Hons.) in electronic and communications engineering from Xidian University in 2013 and 2016, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in information engineering from The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK) in 2020.

The freshness of the sensed state, measured by the age-of-information (AoI), varies at different sensors and is not directly observable to the AP. The AP has to decide which sensor to query/sample in order to get the most updated state information of the object (i.e., the state information with the minimum AoI). In this paper, we formulate the minimum-age scheduling problem as a multi-armed bandit problem with partially observable arms and explore the greedy policy to minimize the expected AoI sampled over an infinite horizon. To analyze the performance of the greedy policy, we 1) put forth a relaxed greedy policy that decouples the sampling processes of the arms, 2) formulate the sampling process of each arm as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP), and 3) derive the average sampled AoI under the relaxed greedy policy as a sum of the average AoI sampled from individual arms. Numerical and simulation results validate that the relaxed greedy policy is an excellent approximation to the greedy policy in terms of the expected AoI sampled over an infinite horizon.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9590543/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 October 2021","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2022","volume":"70","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"14 January 2022","publicationDate":"Jan. 2022","htmlLink":"/document/9590543/","displayDocTitle":"Partially Observable Minimum-Age Scheduling: The Greedy Policy","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"RGC General Research Funds","grantNumber":"14205020"},{"fundingName":"CUHK direct grant for research","grantNumber":"4055126"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Partially Observable Minimum-Age Scheduling: The Greedy Policy","sourcePdf":"tcomm-shao-3123362-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.150558S","chronDate":"Jan.  2022","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"9681827","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"9681827","articleId":"9590543","onlineDate":"27 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2022","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-23"},{"_id":9590546,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaodie Lin","affiliation":["Institute for Interdisciplinary Information Sciences, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"p":["Xiaodie Lin received the B.Eng. degree from Sun Yat-sen University, Guangdong, China, in 2019.

Our motivation is twofold. First, in the near future, the scale of quantum information processing is quite limited, and when quantum resource available is not sufficient for certain tasks, a possible way to strengthen the capability of quantum schemes is introducing extra classical resources. We analyze the mathematical structures of these hybrid protocols, and characterize the relation between the amount of quantum resources and classical resources needed. Second, a fundamental open problem in communication complexity theory is to describe the advantage of sharing prior quantum entanglement over sharing prior randomness, which is still widely open. It turns out that our quantum and classical hybrid protocols provide new insight into this important problem.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 October 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9590546/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2022","volume":"68","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2022","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9590546/","displayDocTitle":"Quantum and Classical Hybrid Generations for Classical Correlations","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100012166","fundingName":"National Key Research and Development Program of China","grantNumber":"2018YFA0306703"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"20181311604"},{"fundingName":"Zhongguancun Haihua Institute for Frontier Information Technology"},{"fundingName":"National Key R&D Program of China","grantNumber":"2018YFB1003202"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61972191"},{"fundingName":"Program for Innovative Talents and Entrepreneur in Jiangsu"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100012226","fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"0202/14380068"},{"fundingName":"Anhui Initiative in Quantum Information Technologies","grantNumber":"AHY150100"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Quantum and Classical Hybrid Generations for Classical Correlations","sourcePdf":"tit-wei-3123401-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.062739S","chronDate":"Jan.  2022","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"9660615","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","xplore-issue":"9660615","articleId":"9590546","onlineDate":"27 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2022","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-22"},{"_id":9590564,"authors":[{"name":"Venkatesan Guruswami","affiliation":["Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Venkatesan Guruswami (Fellow, IEEE) received the bachelor\u2019s degree from the Indian Institute of Technology, Madras, in 1997, and the Ph.D. degree from MIT in 2001.

Analysis for Preventing Landslides Using Deep Learning","abstract":"Landslides account for approximately 5% of natural disasters resulting in significant socio-economic impacts. As a major infrastructure issue, slope stability has been traditionally analyzed with multiple deterministic and probabilistic methods to evaluate the stability of slopes or the probability of landslides. Geotechnical engineers tend to visit the sites of slopes, measure the geometry and soil properties, and use those traditional methods to analyze the slope stability and provide a factor of safety evaluation and recommendation. The fast-growing new technologies such as the internet of things and big data analytics provide new directions for natural hazard prevention. This study is the first to use deep learning as a new method for slope stability analysis for landslide prevention. A convolutional neural network was used to establish the model via transfer learning for processing simulated slope images. After training, our model can accurately predict the factor of safety of slopes for new slope images. Our proposed method was validated by comparing it with a classic limit equilibrium method, i.e., the simplified Bishop method, which is widely used in commercial programs for slope stability analysis. The comparison results showed that our proposed deep learning method outperformed the traditional method by decreasing the computation time by orders of magnitude without sacrificing accuracy. The results demonstrated the possibility and advantages of using deep learning as a new type of slope stability analysis method, including its ability to analyze raw image data directly, high level of automation, satisfactory accuracy, and short computing time, which will enable onsite evaluation for slope stability analysis. Thus, it facilitates fast in-situ decision-making for geotechnical applications and ensures the feasibility of using the internet of things and big data analytics for natural hazard prevention.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9590569/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 October 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9590569/","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2021","publicationDate":"2021","accessionNumber":"21273674","volume":"9","isOpenAccess":true,"isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Image-Data-Driven Slope Stability Analysis for Preventing Landslides Using Deep Learning","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation through the Civil, Mechanical and Manufacturing Innovation (CMMI)","grantNumber":"1742656"},{"fundingName":"Extreme Science and Engineering Discovery Environment (XSEDE)","grantNumber":"ACI-1548562"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Image-Data-Driven Slope Stability Analysis for Preventing Landslides Using Deep Learning","sourcePdf":"access-sun-3123501-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.155306S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"9312710","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","xplore-issue":"9312710","articleId":"9590569","onlineDate":"27 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2022-01-10"},{"_id":9590627,"authors":[{"name":"Daiki Toda","affiliation":["Yokohama Nat'l Univ., Japan"],"firstName":"Daiki","lastName":"Toda","id":"37089021531"},{"name":"Ren Anzai","affiliation":["Yokohama Nat'l Univ., Japan"],"firstName":"Ren","lastName":"Anzai","id":"37089023175"},{"name":"Koichi Ichige","affiliation":["Yokohama Nat'l Univ., Japan"],"firstName":"Koichi","lastName":"Ichige","id":"37284348300"},{"name":"Ryo Saito","affiliation":["Murata Manufacturing Co., Ltd., Kyoto, Japan"],"firstName":"Ryo","lastName":"Saito","id":"37086600458"},{"name":"Daichi Ueki","affiliation":["Murata Manufacturing Co., Ltd., Kyoto, Japan"],"firstName":"Daichi","lastName":"Ueki","id":"37089025780"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4958-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4959-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2643-6175"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2643-6140"}],"articleNumber":"9590627","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":23},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9590627","abstract":"This paper presents a method for radar-based contactless vital sensing and ECG (ElectroCardioGram) signal reconstruction using deep learning. ECG signal is a typical representation of heartbeat signals. However, its measurement usually requires any contact device, which is not suitable due to discomfort of subjects. Radar system is effective for vital sensing because it can measure small displacement of body surface caused by breathing and heartbeat without contact. On the other hand, most of the methods using radar system are limited to evaluating simple indices such as heart rate and heartbeat interval while subjects or devices are stationary. In this paper, we propose a method for body surface displacement signals using FMCW (Frequency-Modulated Continuous Wave) radar and reconstructing ECG signals using CNN (Convolutional Neural Network). The result of experiments on six healthy males shows the ECG signals are successfully reconstructed. Furthermore, we confirmed that the proposed method can reconstruct signal waveforms even in an environment with low SNR (Signal-to-Noise Ratio).","doi":"10.1109/ISCIT52804.2021.9590627","startPage":"176","endPage":"181","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 20th International Symposium on Communications and Information Technologies (ISCIT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9590247/9590575/09590627.pdf","publicationTitle":"2021 20th International Symposium on Communications and Information Technologies (ISCIT)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCIT52804.2021.9590627","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9590575","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"ECG Signal Reconstruction Using FMCW Radar and Convolutional Neural Network","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Surface reconstruction","Surface waves","Heart beat","Radar measurements","Radar","Electrocardiography","Signal reconstruction"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Electrocardiogram","Heartbeat","Frequency-Modulated Continuous Wave radar","Convolutional Neural Network"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9590627/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-22 Oct. 2021","displayDocTitle":"ECG Signal Reconstruction Using FMCW Radar and Convolutional Neural Network","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9590627/","publicationDate":"19 Oct. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"13 November 2021","conferenceDate":"19-22 Oct. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"ECG Signal Reconstruction Using FMCW Radar and Convolutional Neural Network","confLoc":"Tottori, Japan","sourcePdf":"40_F3-3.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.0614S","chronDate":"19-22 Oct. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9590247","isNumber":"9590575","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9590247","xplore-issue":"9590575","articleId":"9590627","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":9590663,"authors":[{"name":"Hanyu Wang","affiliation":["Boston University, Boston, USA"],"firstName":"Hanyu","lastName":"Wang","id":"37089025969"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4124-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4123-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3106-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9590663","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":5},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9590663","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Deep learning","Solid modeling","Ultrasonic imaging","Transfer learning","Speech recognition","Network architecture"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["DL neural network","CNN","Image recognition"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICISCAE52414.2021.9590663","pdfPath":"/iel7/9590369/9590638/09590663.pdf","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 4th International Conference on Information Systems and Computer Aided Education (ICISCAE)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 4th International Conference on Information Systems and Computer Aided Education (ICISCAE)","startPage":"316","endPage":"319","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9590638","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICISCAE52414.2021.9590663","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Research on Bioengineering Algorithm Based on Deep Learning Neural Network","abstract":"Deep learning (DL) is a fresh study orientation in the field of machine learning in computer science.

The Pareto front is obtained from the multi-objective problem, represented by the bus's PQ curve under analysis. The multiobjective optimization problem is solved by combining two functions and the limits of active and reactive power margins at the same bus. Complementary, the methodology is applied to the IEEE 14 Bus system to evaluate its applicability, analyze the results, and evidence its strengths. Thus, a reliable method is provided to assess the bus's power margins, the system's security in electrical networks, and the EPS loadability limits.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-15 Oct. 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9590665/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9590665/","publicationDate":"12 Oct. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"13 November 2021","conferenceDate":"12-15 Oct. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Multi-objective Optimization of Active and Reactive Power to assess Bus Loadability Limit","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-objective Optimization of Active and Reactive Power to assess Bus Loadability Limit","confLoc":"Cuenca, Ecuador","sourcePdf":"paper_16.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06002S","chronDate":"12-15 Oct. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9590446","isNumber":"9590633","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9590446","xplore-issue":"9590633","articleId":"9590665","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":9590790,"authors":[{"name":"Kaiyu Lu","affiliation":["Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University, Suzhou, Jiangsu, China"],"firstName":"Kaiyu","lastName":"Lu","id":"37089028840"},{"name":"Yong Yue","affiliation":["Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University, Suzhou, Jiangsu, China"],"firstName":"Yong","lastName":"Yue","id":"37534128900"},{"name":"Jieming Ma","affiliation":["Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University, Suzhou, Jiangsu, China"],"firstName":"Jieming","lastName":"Ma","id":"37086061333"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4124-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4123-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3106-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9590790","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":15},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Location awareness","Meters","Support vector machines","Visualization","Neural networks","Organizations","Size measurement"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["LoRa","BP Neural Network","RSSI","localization"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9590790","abstract":"Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) technique is often used to estimate locations.

The proposed method reaches the maximum detection probability (100%) from a Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) equal to -16 dB.","doi":"10.1109/ICECCME52200.2021.9590969","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICECCME52200.2021.9590969","startPage":"01","endPage":"05","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 International Conference on Electrical, Computer, Communications and Mechatronics Engineering (ICECCME)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9590450/9590827/09590969.pdf","publicationTitle":"2021 International Conference on Electrical, Computer, Communications and Mechatronics Engineering (ICECCME)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9590827","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Selective Sampling Based Angular Domain Cyclostationary Feature Detection of ODFM Signals","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"7-8 Oct. 2021","displayDocTitle":"Selective Sampling Based Angular Domain Cyclostationary Feature Detection of ODFM Signals","conferenceDate":"7-8 Oct. 2021","publicationDate":"7 Oct. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2021","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9590969/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9590969/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Selective Sampling Based Angular Domain Cyclostationary Feature Detection of ODFM Signals","confLoc":"Mauritius, Mauritius","sourcePdf":"199-2021184333.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053444S","chronDate":"7-8 Oct. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9590450","isNumber":"9590827","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9590450","xplore-issue":"9590827","articleId":"9590969","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-26"},{"_id":9591029,"authors":[{"name":"Farshad Farahnakian","affiliation":["School of Digital technology Tallinn University, Tallinn, Estonia"],"firstName":"Farshad","lastName":"Farahnakian","id":"37089022760"},{"name":"Janika Leoste","affiliation":["School of Educational science Tallinn University, Tallinn, Estonia"],"firstName":"Janika","lastName":"Leoste","id":"37089022731"},{"name":"Fahimeh Farahnakian","affiliation":["University of Turku, Turku, Finland"],"firstName":"Fahimeh","lastName":"Farahnakian","id":"37662210400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-1262-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-2943-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9591029","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":19},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9591029","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wearable computers","Transfer learning","Mouth","Feature extraction","Cameras","Time measurement","Convolutional neural networks"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Driver Drowsiness Detection","Convolutional Neural Network","Deep Learning","Transfer Learning","Computer Vision"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICECCME52200.2021.9591029","pdfPath":"/iel7/9590450/9590827/09591029.pdf","publicationTitle":"2021 International Conference on Electrical, Computer, Communications and Mechatronics Engineering (ICECCME)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 International Conference on Electrical, Computer, Communications and Mechatronics Engineering (ICECCME)","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9590827","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICECCME52200.2021.9591029","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Driver Drowsiness Detection Using Deep Convolutional Neural Network","abstract":"Detecting driver drowsiness is a very important task for enhancing the safety of road driving and reducing numerous accidents. In this paper, we proposed a fusion drowsiness detection framework based on video images without any additional wearable devices. The framework first applies Haar feature-based cascade classifiers on the input image to extract the region proposal of the driver's face, eyes and mouth. These interest proposals are then fed into three separate Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to extract features and predict a class for each proposal based on defined classes. To improve classification performance, we applied transfer learning by using the pre-trained CNNs on images that belong to each region proposal. Finally, the framework can identify driver drowsiness through the defined rules applying to the predicted classes of each region. The rules specify the final class based on the class of mouth and eye to increase the robustness of the framework. The obtained results on the real RLDD dataset [1] show that the proposed framework can identify driver drowsiness with high accuracy and speed.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-8 Oct. 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9591029/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9591029/","publicationDate":"7 Oct. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2021","conferenceDate":"7-8 Oct. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Driver Drowsiness Detection Using Deep Convolutional Neural Network","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Driver Drowsiness Detection Using Deep Convolutional Neural Network","confLoc":"Mauritius, Mauritius","sourcePdf":"351-2021184234.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.090507S","chronDate":"7-8 Oct. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9590450","isNumber":"9590827","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9590450","xplore-issue":"9590827","articleId":"9591029","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":9591053,"authors":[{"name":"Mohamed Moutchou","affiliation":["Research Group \u201cSCDRE\u201d, Laboratory of Complex Cyber Physical Systems (LCCPS), ENSAM, Hassan II University, Casablanca, Morocco"],"firstName":"Mohamed","lastName":"Moutchou","id":"38490624700"},{"name":"Younes Abouelmahjoub","affiliation":["National school of applied sciences Chouaib Doukkali University, EL Jadida, Morocco"],"firstName":"Younes","lastName":"Abouelmahjoub","id":"37085534962"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-1262-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-2943-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9591053","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":11},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Photovoltaic systems","Radiation effects","Temperature","Parameter estimation","Simulation","Photovoltaic cells","Voltage"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["photovoltaic","solar energy","modelling","identification","optimization","metaheuristic","genetic algorithm"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9591053","abstract":"The research presented in this paper, present a work, that respond to problem and the need of identification of model parameters of a photovoltaic module.

A promising solution partially suppressing the fast COVID spread in the dense areas is the digital contact tracing of the infected persons and those who they encounter. Digital contact tracing is an effective solution, whilst few notable drawbacks must be addressed. In general, we are facing both, technological and legal issues, when reconstructing the precise trajectories of the infected persons. The former one stems from the fact that there is commonly a need for personal intervention (specific application, GPS locator, Bluetooth), the latter one deals with the legal aspects of revealing the personal information to the governments/3rd parties. Technological limitations (battery draining, loss of GPS signal, etc.) limits the accuracy of trajectories, especially in dense urban areas. In this paper, we use the autonomous machine learning framework based on the application of the generative adversarial networks (GAN) that is capable of accurate reconstruction of the person trajectories identifying as far as 20% more contacts. Later, this specific person-sensitive information is processed in the private operators' database and blockchain platform is used to securely store healthiness information. The proposed concept facilitates the retrieval of accurate information on the trail of the COVID transparently, being limpid towards privacy and confidentiality concerns.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9591057/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-8 Oct. 2021","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"7-8 Oct. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9591057/","dateOfInsertion":"13 November 2021","publicationDate":"7 Oct. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Deep Learning-Based Blockchain Framework for the COVID-19 Spread Monitoring","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100005357","fundingName":"Slovak Research and Development Agency","grantNumber":"APVV-18-0214"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003194","fundingName":"Scientific Grant Agency of the Ministry of Education, science, research","grantNumber":"1/0268/19"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100013843","fundingName":"Ukrainian government"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Deep Learning-Based Blockchain Framework for the COVID-19 Spread Monitoring","confLoc":"Mauritius, Mauritius","sourcePdf":"210-2021182879.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070599S","chronDate":"7-8 Oct. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9590450","isNumber":"9590827","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9590450","xplore-issue":"9590827","articleId":"9591057","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-26"},{"_id":9591201,"authors":[{"name":"Rui Ma","affiliation":["","the Research Institute of Trustworthy Autonomous Systems, Southern University of Science and Technology, Shenzhen, China"],"firstName":"Rui","lastName":"Ma","id":"38469487600"},{"name":"Qi Hao","affiliation":["","the Research Institute of Trustworthy Autonomous Systems, Southern University of Science and Technology, Shenzhen, China"],"firstName":"Qi","lastName":"Hao","id":"37403530000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4521-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4522-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9591201","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":14},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9591201","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Image coding","Frequency-domain analysis","Image edge detection","Neural networks","Hardware","Computational efficiency"]}],"doi":"10.1109/MFI52462.2021.9591201","pdfPath":"/iel7/9591157/9591159/09591201.pdf","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Conference on Multisensor Fusion and Integration for Intelligent Systems (MFI)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Conference on Multisensor Fusion and Integration for Intelligent Systems (MFI)","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9591159","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MFI52462.2021.9591201","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"CS-Fnet: A Compressive Sampling Frequency Neural Network for Simultaneous Image Compression and Recognition","abstract":"Data recognition using compressive measurements is desired for intelligent edge devices to save computation and communication resources. However, direct recognition of compressed image data is often difficult because the compression operation disturbs the original signal structure. In compressive sensing (CS), original signals are transformed into the frequency domain or other domains for sparse representations. This paper presents a compressive sampling frequency neural network (CS- Fnet) to achieve high computational efficiency for compressed image recognition, whose measurement matrix (MM) is automatically obtained through the CS- Fnet training. Furthermore, the MM is constructed in the form of the Kronecker product, which can reduce the number of MM parameters, and hence the CS-Fnet training can achieve much higher computational efficiency and convergence speed. The proposed method is validated using the MNIST dataset and gesture datasets. The experiment results demonstrate that the proposed CS- Fnet outperforms traditional convolution neural networks (CNNs) in terms of image recognition accuracy, and the learned MMs yield higher reconstruction accuracy than traditional MMs.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 Sept. 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9591201/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9591201/","publicationDate":"23 Sept. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2021","conferenceDate":"23-25 Sept. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"CS-Fnet: A Compressive Sampling Frequency Neural Network for Simultaneous Image Compression and Recognition","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61773197"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"CS-Fnet: A Compressive Sampling Frequency Neural Network for Simultaneous Image Compression and Recognition","confLoc":"Karlsruhe, Germany","sourcePdf":"33.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07197S","chronDate":"23-25 Sept. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9591157","isNumber":"9591159","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9591157","xplore-issue":"9591159","articleId":"9591201","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":9591204,"authors":[{"name":"Yifei Zhu","affiliation":["University of Sheffield, UK"],"firstName":"Yifei","lastName":"Zhu","id":"37086525967"},{"name":"Peng Wang","affiliation":["Manchester Metropolitan University, Manchester, United Kingdom"],"firstName":"Peng","lastName":"Wang","id":"37086526754"},{"name":"Lyudmila Mihaylova","affiliation":["University of Sheffield, UK"],"firstName":"Lyudmila","lastName":"Mihaylova","id":"37284641500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4521-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4522-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9591204","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":16},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9591204","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Uncertainty","Conferences","Gaussian processes","Convolutional neural networks","Noise measurement","Root mean square","Intelligent systems"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Traffic Prediction","Gaussian Process","Deep Neural Network","Large Scale","Scalability"]}],"doi":"10.1109/MFI52462.2021.9591204","pdfPath":"/iel7/9591157/9591159/09591204.pdf","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Conference on Multisensor Fusion and Integration for Intelligent Systems (MFI)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Conference on Multisensor Fusion and Integration for Intelligent Systems (MFI)","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9591159","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MFI52462.2021.9591204","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Convolutional Neural Network Combined with a Gaussian Process for Speed Prediction in Traffic Networks","abstract":"This paper proposes a traffic speed prediction framework combining a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with a Gaussian Process (G P) and is an extension of Conv N et-GP [1].

Our main result is a closed-form characterization of the fundamental trade-off between secret rate and public communication rate.","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2021.3122808","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","startPage":"549","endPage":"559","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2021.3122808","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9660615","pdfPath":"/iel7/18/9660615/09591225.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Random variables","Cryptography","Entropy","Quantization (signal)","Encoding","Compounds","Materials reliability"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Secret sharing","information-theoretic security","rate-limited communication","Gaussian sources"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Information-Theoretic Secret Sharing From Correlated Gaussian Random Variables and Public Communication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9591225/","volume":"68","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/9591225/","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2021","publicationDate":"Jan. 2022","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 October 2021","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2022","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"NSF","grantNumber":"CCF-1850227 and CCF-2047913"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Information-Theoretic Secret Sharing From Correlated Gaussian Random Variables and Public Communication","sourcePdf":"tit-rana-3122808-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.165742S","chronDate":"Jan.  2022","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"9660615","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","xplore-issue":"9660615","articleId":"9591225","onlineDate":"27 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2022","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-22"},{"_id":9591239,"authors":[{"name":"Peihua Li","affiliation":["School of Mathematics, Southwest Jiaotong University, Chengdu, China","State Key Laboratory of Cryptology, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"p":["Peihua Li received the B.Sc. degree from the School of Science, Shaanxi University of Science and Technology (SUST), Xi\u2019an, China, in 2016.

If FHSs can ensure a wide-gap between two adjacent frequency points to avoid the frequency points with high interference probability, it will significantly improve the FH communication system\u2019s anti-interference ability. Moreover, if each frequency point appears at the same number of times in a sequence period, the system\u2019s anti-electromagnetic interference will be enhanced. Therefore, it is desirable to employ FHSs with low Hamming autocorrelation, wide frequency-hopping gap, and good uniformity in practical applications. However, to the best of our knowledge, no such infinite classes of FHSs have been reported in the literature to date. This paper aims to present two constructions of uniform wide-gap frequency-hopping sequences (WGFHSs) by concatenating two or three adequately designed sequences. For the first time, we obtain two infinite classes of WGFHSs, which are optimal with respect to the well-known Lempel-Greenberger bound.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Frequency modulation","Autocorrelation","Spread spectrum communication","Mathematics","Frequency conversion","Fans","Encoding"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Wide-gap frequency-hopping sequence","Hamming correlation","uniformity"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9660615","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2021.3123395","startPage":"692","endPage":"700","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel7/18/9660615/09591239.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2021.3123395","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Constructions of Optimal Uniform Wide-Gap Frequency-Hopping Sequences","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 October 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Constructions of Optimal Uniform Wide-Gap Frequency-Hopping Sequences","publicationDate":"Jan. 2022","volume":"68","issue":"1","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2021","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9591239/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9591239/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2022","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"11971395, 62171389, 62071397 and 62131016"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Constructions of Optimal Uniform Wide-Gap Frequency-Hopping Sequences","sourcePdf":"tit-mesnager-3123395-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.070537S","chronDate":"Jan.  2022","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"9660615","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","xplore-issue":"9660615","articleId":"9591239","onlineDate":"27 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2022","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-22"},{"_id":9591243,"authors":[{"name":"J.

Although functionally equivalent, these deployment settings, however, strongly impacts average power consumption and latency of this real time task, hence requiring a thorough optimization. This work analyzes the challenges, benefits, and drawbacks of the different execution modes available for TCN-based KWS inference on dedicated hardware.

We consider both line-of-sight and multipath components and propose frequency- and delay-domain implementations for single- and multi-carrier paradigms in both time-invariant and time-variant scenarios. We implement exhaustive molecular absorption computations based on radiative transfer theory alongside alternative sub-THz approximations. We further model THz-specific constraints, including wideband beam split effects, spherical wave propagation, and misalignment fading.

It also outperforms these object detectors, when subjected to noisy input data and less labeled training data with a lower uncertainty error.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9263394","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2021.3122092","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/83/9263394/09591302.pdf","startPage":"9014","endPage":"9029","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2021.3122092","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Fully Spiking Hybrid Neural Network for Energy-Efficient Object Detection","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","displayDocTitle":"A Fully Spiking Hybrid Neural Network for Energy-Efficient Object Detection","volume":"30","htmlLink":"/document/9591302/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"2021","dateOfInsertion":"13 November 2021","pubMedId":"34705647","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9591302/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 October 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000185","fundingName":"Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA)","grantNumber":"HR0011-17-2-0045"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000183","fundingName":"Army Research Office","grantNumber":"W911NF-19-1-0447"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Fully Spiking Hybrid Neural Network for Energy-Efficient Object Detection","sourcePdf":"tip-chakraborty-3122092-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.165896S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"9263394","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","xplore-issue":"9263394","articleId":"9591302","onlineDate":"27 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-10"},{"_id":9591336,"authors":[{"name":"Cengcang Zeng","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Stevens Institute of Technology, Hoboken, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Cengcang","lastName":"Zeng","orcid":"0000-0003-3228-1743","id":"37088419600"},{"name":"Fangzhou Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Stevens Institute of Technology, Hoboken, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Fangzhou","lastName":"Wang","orcid":"0000-0002-9640-5285","id":"37086388219"},{"name":"Hongbin Li","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Stevens Institute of Technology, Hoboken, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Hongbin","lastName":"Li","orcid":"0000-0003-1453-847X","id":"37281093000"},{"name":"Mark A.

In such cases, the widely used matched filter (MF) cannot perfectly separate the waveforms, and it outputs the filtered echo of the desired waveform (auto term) as well as multiple undesired waveform residuals (cross terms). In this paper, a transmit delay compensation scheme is proposed by employing a set of transmit delay compensation variables to control the cross terms so that they can be utilized to enhance target detection. Specifically, the probability of detection is maximized by optimizing the delay parameters. To solve the resulting nonconvex problem, an optimum solution based on multi-dimensional search and a computationally efficient suboptimal method are proposed. Simulation results show that the proposed delay compensation approach can substantially improve the target detection performance.","doi":"10.1109/LSP.2021.3123582","publicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/97/9686799/09591336.pdf","startPage":"41","endPage":"45","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LSP.2021.3123582","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9686799","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9591336","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Delay Compensation for Distributed MIMO Radar With Non-Orthogonal Waveforms","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Delay Compensation for Distributed MIMO Radar With Non-Orthogonal Waveforms","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9591336/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 October 2021","chronOrPublicationDate":"2022","volume":"29","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9591336/","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2022","publicationDate":"2022","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000183","fundingName":"Army Research Office","grantNumber":"W911NF-19-2-0234"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100008982","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"ECCS-1923739"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Delay Compensation for Distributed MIMO Radar With Non-Orthogonal Waveforms","sourcePdf":"lsp-li-3123582-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.087764S","chronDate":"2022","xplore-pub-id":"97","isNumber":"9686799","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"97","xplore-issue":"9686799","articleId":"9591336","onlineDate":"27 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2022","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-25"},{"_id":9591337,"authors":[{"name":"Qin Wu","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Jiangnan University, Wuxi, China"],"firstName":"Qin","lastName":"Wu","orcid":"0000-0001-8087-3001","id":"37086519673"},{"name":"Shuting Miao","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Jiangnan University, Wuxi, China"],"firstName":"Shuting","lastName":"Miao","id":"37089251718"},{"name":"Zhilei Chai","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Jiangnan University, Wuxi, China"],"firstName":"Zhilei","lastName":"Chai","id":"37395673900"},{"name":"Guodong Guo","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Electrical Engineering, West Virginia University, Morgantown, WV, USA"],"firstName":"Guodong","lastName":"Guo","orcid":"0000-0001-9583-0055","id":"37400119600"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1070-9908"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2361"}],"articleNumber":"9591337","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":49},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fine-Grained Image Classification With Global Information and Adaptive Compensation Loss","abstract":"Fine-grained image classification differs from traditional image classification in that the former needs to divide subclasses under a basic level of categories. Previous works always focus on how to locate discriminative parts of objects, but we find that the global and background information of objects neglected by them is also valuable in some situations. This letter proposes a method to combine the global information and discriminative parts information of objects to do classification, which includes three modules: (1) Activation map based crop-erase module localizes objects while avoiding localization bias due to excessive bias of the network to learn one discriminative part. (2) Part attention module helps learning discriminative part features of objects. (3) Two-level fusion module gives consideration to the global and local information of objects and some potentially effective background information. Meanwhile, we propose an adaptive compensation loss to distinguish easily confused categories.

To solve the JEVAR problem, we propose a novel scheme, wherein the target transmits a pair of conjugate Zadoff-Chu (ZC) sequences and the multi-antenna receiver conducts maximum likelihood (ML) estimation. The proposed scheme is computationally efficient: it uses alternating projection (AP) to reduce the high-dimensional problem due to the multipaths to multiple lower-dimensional ones per path; it uses a conjugate pair of ZC sequences to decouple the joint estimation of the frequency and time offsets of each path into two separate estimates. The proposed scheme is highly versatile: it can resolve the multipaths with super resolution in both spatial and temporal domain; it can measure the velocity of the target via estimating the frequency offsets of the line-of-sight (LOS) signal and its multipath reflections. The simulations verify the effectiveness of the proposed scheme by showing that its performance can approach the Cramer-Rao bound (CRB).","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9591345/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 October 2021","volume":"69","publicationDate":"2021","htmlLink":"/document/9591345/","dateOfInsertion":"11 November 2021","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Joint Estimation of Velocity, Angle-of-Arrival and Range (JEVAR) Using a Conjugate Pair of Zadoff-Chu Sequences","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61771005"},{"fundingName":"IEEE Global Communications Conference 2021 in Madrid"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint Estimation of Velocity, Angle-of-Arrival and Range (JEVAR) Using a Conjugate Pair of Zadoff-Chu Sequences","sourcePdf":"tsp-jiang-3122907-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.106629S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"9307529","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","xplore-issue":"9307529","articleId":"9591345","onlineDate":"27 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-12"},{"_id":9591365,"authors":[{"name":"Xuechen Liu","affiliation":["CNRS, Universit\u00e9 de Lorraine, Inria, LORIA, Nancy, France","School of Computing, University of Eastern Finland, Joensuu, Finland"],"firstName":"Xuechen","lastName":"Liu","orcid":"0000-0003-1207-5651"},{"name":"Md Sahidullah","affiliation":["CNRS, Universit\u00e9 de Lorraine, Inria, LORIA, Nancy, France"],"firstName":"Md","lastName":"Sahidullah","orcid":"0000-0002-0624-2903"},{"name":"Tomi Kinnunen","affiliation":["School of Computing, University of Eastern Finland, Joensuu, Finland"],"firstName":"Tomi","lastName":"Kinnunen","orcid":"0000-0002-4371-7322"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1070-9908"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2361"}],"articleNumber":"9591365","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":25},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimizing Multi-Taper Features for Deep Speaker Verification","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Feature extraction","Discrete Fourier transforms","Task analysis","Neural networks","Mel frequency cepstral coefficient","Stochastic processes","Standards"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Multi-taper spectrum","speaker verification"]}],"abstract":"Multi-taper estimators provide low-variance power spectrum estimates that can be used in place of the windowed discrete Fourier transform (DFT) to extract speech features such as mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs).

The multi-frequency sparse arrays are designed to offer zero lag redundancy in the rendered difference coarray so that the available degrees of freedom are fully utilized to enable high-resolution DOA estimation. A modified sensor interpolation technique is developed to accurately estimate the signal correlation matrix so that the effect of holes in the difference coarray is mitigated. The proposed technique accounts for both self-lags between signals corresponding to the same frequencies and the cross-lags between signals corresponding to different frequencies. As such, it enhances the DOA estimation performance compared to existing methods that either perform array interpolation utilizing only the self-lags or carry out group sparse reconstruction without exploiting array interpolation. Simulation results verify the offerings of the multi-frequency sparse arrays.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2021.3122292","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9307529","startPage":"5935","endPage":"5946","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/78/9307529/09591425.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Enhanced DOA Estimation Exploiting Multi-Frequency Sparse Array","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9591425/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 October 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9591425/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Enhanced DOA Estimation Exploiting Multi-Frequency Sparse Array","publicationDate":"2021","dateOfInsertion":"09 November 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"69","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"IEEE Sensor Array and Multichannel Signal Processing Workshop"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Enhanced DOA Estimation Exploiting Multi-Frequency Sparse Array","sourcePdf":"tsp-zhang-3122292-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.118174S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"9307529","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","xplore-issue":"9307529","articleId":"9591425","onlineDate":"27 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-12"},{"_id":9591452,"authors":[{"name":"Jinshuai Yang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jinshuai","lastName":"Yang","orcid":"0000-0002-6293-1981","id":"37088636523"},{"name":"Zhongliang Yang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zhongliang","lastName":"Yang","id":"37085833956"},{"name":"Siyu Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Siyu","lastName":"Zhang","orcid":"0000-0003-4954-9515","id":"37088522181"},{"name":"Haoqin Tu","affiliation":["School of Cyber Security, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Haoqin","lastName":"Tu","id":"37089250568"},{"name":"Yongfeng Huang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yongfeng","lastName":"Huang","orcid":"0000-0003-3825-2230","id":"37439950400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1070-9908"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2361"}],"articleNumber":"9591452","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":55},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Semantics","Syntactics","Feature extraction","Transformers","Linguistics","Steganography","Correlation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Linguistic steganalysis","syntactic feature","graph network"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9591452","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"SeSy: Linguistic Steganalysis Framework Integrating Semantic and Syntactic Features","doi":"10.1109/LSP.2021.3122901","startPage":"31","endPage":"35","publicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/97/9686799/09591452.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9686799","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LSP.2021.3122901","abstract":"With the rapid development of natural language processing technology and linguistic steganography, linguistic steganalysis gains considerable interest in recent years. Current advanced methods dominantly focus on statistical features in semantic view yet ignore syntax structure of text, which leads to limited performance to some newly statistically indistinguishable steganography algorithms. To fill this gap, in this paper, we propose a novel linguistic steganalysis framework named SeSy to integrate both \n<bold xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">se</b>\nmantic and \n<bold xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">sy</b>\nntactic features. Specifically, we propose to employ transformer-architecture language model as semantics extractor and leverage a graph attention network to retain syntactic features. Extensive experimental results show that owing to additional syntactic information, the SeSy framework effectively brings about remarkable improvement to current advanced linguistic steganalysis methods.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9591452/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 October 2021","chronOrPublicationDate":"2022","volume":"29","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2022","publicationDate":"2022","htmlLink":"/document/9591452/","displayDocTitle":"SeSy: Linguistic Steganalysis Framework Integrating Semantic and Syntactic Features","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"U1936216 and 61862002"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SeSy: Linguistic Steganalysis Framework Integrating Semantic and Syntactic Features","sourcePdf":"lsp-yang-3122901-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.092498S","chronDate":"2022","xplore-pub-id":"97","isNumber":"9686799","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"97","xplore-issue":"9686799","articleId":"9591452","onlineDate":"27 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2022","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-25"},{"_id":9591456,"authors":[{"name":"Sitao Huang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, IL, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/12/9605655/9591456/huang-3123465-small.gif","p":["Sitao Huang received the BEng degree in electrial engineering from Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, in 2014, and the MS degree in electrical and computer engineering from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Champaign, Illinois, in 2017.

However, a high-quality FPGA design is very hard to create and optimize as it requires FPGA expertise and a long design iteration time. In contrast, software applications are typically developed in a short development cycle, with high-level languages like Python, which have much higher levels of abstraction than all existing hardware design flows. To close this gap between hardware design flows and software applications, and simplify FPGA programming, we create PyLog, a high-level, algorithm-centric Python-based programming and synthesis flow for FPGA. PyLog is powered by a set of compiler optimization passes and a type inference system to generate high-quality hardware design. It abstracts away the implementation details, and allows designers to focus on algorithm specification. PyLog takes in Python functions, generates PyLog intermediate representation (PyLog IR), performs several optimization passes, including pragma insertion, design space exploration, and memory customization, etc., and creates complete FPGA system designs. PyLog also has a runtime that allows users to run the PyLog code directly on the target FPGA platform without any extra code development. The whole design flow is automated. Evaluation shows that PyLog significantly improves FPGA design productivity and generates highly efficient FPGA designs that outperform highly optimized CPU implementation and state-of-the-art FPGA implementation by \n<inline-formula><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$3.17\\times$</tex-math></inline-formula>\n and \n<inline-formula><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$1.24\\times$</tex-math></inline-formula>\n on average.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9591456/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec. 1 2021","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 October 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"70","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"1 Dec. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"08 November 2021","isOpenAccess":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9591456/","displayDocTitle":"PyLog: An Algorithm-Centric Python-Based FPGA Programming and Synthesis Flow","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Xilinx Center of Excellence at UIUC"},{"fundingName":"Xilinx Adaptive Compute Cluster"},{"fundingName":"Hewlett Packard Labs","grantNumber":"BAH HT 15-1158"},{"fundingName":"IBM-ILLINOIS Center for Cognitive Computing Systems Research"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"PyLog: An Algorithm-Centric Python-Based FPGA Programming and Synthesis Flow","sourcePdf":"tc-huang-3123465-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.1947S","chronDate":"Dec. 1 2021","xplore-pub-id":"12","isNumber":"9605655","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","xplore-issue":"9605655","articleId":"9591456","onlineDate":"27 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-11-12"},{"_id":9591497,"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1053-5888"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0792"}],"articleNumber":"9591497","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":" \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org/"}],"abstract":"Advertisement.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Mathworks","publicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Magazine","doi":"10.1109/MSP.2021.3117015","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel7/79/9591543/09591497.pdf","startPage":"C4","endPage":"C4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MSP.2021.3117015","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9591543","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9591497","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9591497/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 October 2021","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2021","displayDocTitle":"Mathworks","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"38","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/9591497/","dateOfInsertion":"27 October 2021","publicationDate":"Nov. 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mathworks","sourcePdf":"38msp06-sp4315-3117015-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.019196S","chronDate":"Nov.  2021","xplore-pub-id":"79","isNumber":"9591543","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"79","xplore-issue":"9591543","articleId":"9591497","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-31"},{"_id":9591498,"authors":[{"name":"Arman Kheirati Roonizi","affiliation":["Fasa University, Fasa, Iran"],"bio":{"p":["Arman Kheirati Roonizi (ebad.kheirati.roonizi@gmail.com) received his Ph.D. degree in computer science from the University of Milan, Italy, in 2017.

Also, over the past years, given their ubiquitous and affordable characteristics, the use of smartphones and wearable devices has grown rapidly and provided support within all aspects of mental health research and care\u2014from screening and diagnosis to treatment and monitoring\u2014and attained significant progress in improving remote mental health interventions. While there are still many challenges to be tackled in this emerging cross-disciplinary research field, such as data scarcity, lack of personalization, and privacy concerns, it is of primary importance that innovative signal processing and deep learning (DL) techniques are exploited. In particular, recent advances in DL can help provide a key enabling technology for the development of next-generation user-centric mobile mental health applications. In this article, we briefly introduce the basic principles associated with mobile device-based mental health analysis, review the main system components, and highlight the conventional technologies involved. We also describe several major challenges and various DL technologies that have potential for strongly contributing to dealing with these issues, and we discuss other problems to be addressed via research collaboration across multiple disciplines.","doi":"10.1109/MSP.2021.3099293","publicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel7/79/9591543/09591504.pdf","startPage":"96","endPage":"105","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MSP.2021.3099293","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9591543","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Deep Learning for Mobile Mental Health: Challenges and recent advances","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9591504","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 October 2021","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9591504/","displayDocTitle":"Deep Learning for Mobile Mental Health: Challenges and recent advances","volume":"38","issue":"6","publicationDate":"Nov. 2021","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9591504/","dateOfInsertion":"27 October 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"62071330, 61702370 and 61831022"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Deep Learning for Mobile Mental Health: Challenges and recent advances","sourcePdf":"38msp06-han-3099293-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.072322S","chronDate":"Nov.  2021","xplore-pub-id":"79","isNumber":"9591543","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"79","xplore-issue":"9591543","articleId":"9591504","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-31"},{"_id":9591505,"authors":[{"name":"Chi-Chun Lee","affiliation":["National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu City, 300044, Taiwan"],"bio":{"p":["Chi-Chun Lee (cclee@ee.nthu.edu.tw) received his Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from the University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California, USA, in 2012.

We expand on an interpersonal communication framework to elucidate how to identify sources of bias that may arise in the process of inferring human emotions and other psychological constructs from observed behavior. The various methods and metrics for measuring fairness and bias are discussed, along with pertinent implications within the U.S. legal context. We illustrate how to measure some types of bias and fairness in a case study involving automatic personality and hireability inference from multimodal data collected in video interviews for mock job applications. We encourage AC researchers and practitioners to encapsulate bias and fairness in their research processes and products and to consider their role, agency, and responsibility in promoting equitable and just systems.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel7/79/9591543/09591546.pdf","startPage":"84","endPage":"95","publicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Magazine","doi":"10.1109/MSP.2021.3106615","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MSP.2021.3106615","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9591543","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9591546","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Integrating Psychometrics and Computing Perspectives on Bias and Fairness in Affective Computing: A case study of automated video interviews","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Measurement","Affective computing","Law","Psychology","Machine learning","Behavioral sciences"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9591546/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2021","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 October 2021","displayDocTitle":"Integrating Psychometrics and Computing Perspectives on Bias and Fairness in Affective Computing: A case study of automated video interviews","volume":"38","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/9591546/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"27 October 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"IIS 1921087 and IIS 1921111"},{"fundingName":"National Science Foundation (NSF) National AI Institute for Student-AI Teaming","grantNumber":"DRL 2019805"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Integrating Psychometrics and Computing Perspectives on Bias and Fairness in Affective Computing: A case study of automated video interviews","sourcePdf":"38msp06-booth-3106615-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.069942S","chronDate":"Nov.  2021","xplore-pub-id":"79","isNumber":"9591543","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"79","xplore-issue":"9591543","articleId":"9591546","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-31"},{"_id":9591547,"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1053-5888"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0792"}],"articleNumber":"9591547","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":" \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org/"}],"abstract":"Presents a listing of the editorial board, board of governors, current staff, committee members, and/or society editors for this issue of the publication.","doi":"10.1109/MSP.2021.3096152","publicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel7/79/9591543/09591547.pdf","startPage":"2","endPage":"2","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MSP.2021.3096152","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9591543","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Masthead","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9591547","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 October 2021","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9591547/","displayDocTitle":"Masthead","volume":"38","issue":"6","publicationDate":"Nov. 2021","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9591547/","dateOfInsertion":"27 October 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Masthead","sourcePdf":"38msp06-masthead-3096152-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.017222S","chronDate":"Nov.  2021","xplore-pub-id":"79","isNumber":"9591543","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"79","xplore-issue":"9591543","articleId":"9591547","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-31"},{"_id":9591548,"authors":[{"name":"John Edwards","bio":{"p":["John Edwards (jedwards@johnedwardsmedia.com) is a technology writer based in Gilbert, Arizona, 85234, USA.

In this tutorial, we discuss several key aspects of multimodal emotion recognition (MER).","doi":"10.1109/MSP.2021.3106895","publicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel7/79/9591543/09591550.pdf","startPage":"59","endPage":"73","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MSP.2021.3106895","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9591543","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Emotion Recognition From Multiple Modalities: Fundamentals and methodologies","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9591550","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 October 2021","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9591550/","displayDocTitle":"Emotion Recognition From Multiple Modalities: Fundamentals and methodologies","volume":"38","issue":"6","publicationDate":"Nov. 2021","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9591550/","dateOfInsertion":"27 October 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100012166","fundingName":"National Key Research and Development Program of China","grantNumber":"2018AAA0100403"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61701273, 61876094, U1933114, 61925107 and U1936202"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100006606","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Tianjin","grantNumber":"20JCJQJC00020, 18JCYBJC15400 and 18ZXZNGX00110"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Emotion Recognition From Multiple Modalities: Fundamentals and methodologies","sourcePdf":"38msp06-zhao-3106895-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.097465S","chronDate":"Nov.  2021","xplore-pub-id":"79","isNumber":"9591543","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"79","xplore-issue":"9591543","articleId":"9591550","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-31"},{"_id":9591551,"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1053-5888"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0792"}],"articleNumber":"9591551","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":" \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org/"}],"abstract":"Presents the front cover for this issue of the publication.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel7/79/9591543/09591551.pdf","startPage":"C1","endPage":"C1","publicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Magazine","doi":"10.1109/MSP.2021.3087882","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MSP.2021.3087882","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9591543","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9591551","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Front Cover","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9591551/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2021","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 October 2021","displayDocTitle":"Front Cover","volume":"38","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/9591551/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"27 October 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Front Cover","sourcePdf":"38msp06-cover1-3087882-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.014657S","chronDate":"Nov.  2021","xplore-pub-id":"79","isNumber":"9591543","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"79","xplore-issue":"9591543","articleId":"9591551","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-31"},{"_id":9591552,"authors":[{"name":"Zitong Yu","affiliation":["University of Oulu, Oulu, Finland"],"bio":{"p":["Zitong Yu (zitong.yu@oulu.fi) received his M.S. degree in multimedia from the University of Nantes.

Physiological responses are more reliable and harder to alter compared to explicit behaviors (such as facial expressions and speech), but they require special contact sensors to obtain. Research in the last decade has shown that photoplethysmography (PPG) signals can be remotely measured (rPPG) from facial videos under ambient light, from which physiological changes can be extracted. This promising finding has attracted much interest from researchers, and the field of rPPG measurement has been growing fast. In this article, we review current progress on intelligent signal processing approaches for rPPG measurement, including earlier works on unsupervised approaches and recently proposed supervised models, benchmark data sets, and performance evaluation. We also review studies on rPPG-based affective applications and compare them with other affective computing modalities. We conclude this article by emphasizing the current main challenges and highlighting future directions.","doi":"10.1109/MSP.2021.3106285","publicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel7/79/9591543/09591552.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MSP.2021.3106285","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9591543","startPage":"50","endPage":"58","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Facial-Video-Based Physiological Signal Measurement: Recent advances and affective applications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9591552","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Facial-Video-Based Physiological Signal Measurement: Recent advances and affective applications","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9591552/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 October 2021","isJournal":true,"volume":"38","issue":"6","publicationDate":"Nov. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"27 October 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9591552/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61772419"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002341","fundingName":"Academy of Finland","grantNumber":"316765 and 323287"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Facial-Video-Based Physiological Signal Measurement: Recent advances and affective applications","sourcePdf":"38msp06-yu-3106285-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.070448S","chronDate":"Nov.  2021","xplore-pub-id":"79","isNumber":"9591543","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"79","xplore-issue":"9591543","articleId":"9591552","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-31"},{"_id":9591553,"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1053-5888"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0792"}],"articleNumber":"9591553","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":" \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org/"}],"abstract":"Presents the SPS society calendar of upcoming events and meetings.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Calendar [Dates Ahead]","publicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Magazine","doi":"10.1109/MSP.2021.3087883","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel7/79/9591543/09591553.pdf","startPage":"C3","endPage":"C3","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MSP.2021.3087883","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9591543","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9591553","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9591553/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 October 2021","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2021","displayDocTitle":"Calendar [Dates Ahead]","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"38","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/9591553/","dateOfInsertion":"27 October 2021","publicationDate":"Nov. 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Calendar [Dates Ahead]","sourcePdf":"38msp06-calendar-3087883-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.015205S","chronDate":"Nov.  2021","xplore-pub-id":"79","isNumber":"9591543","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"79","xplore-issue":"9591543","articleId":"9591553","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-31"},{"_id":9591554,"authors":[{"name":"Ahmed Tewfik","firstName":"Ahmed","lastName":"Tewfik","id":"37088393449"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1053-5888"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0792"}],"articleNumber":"9591554","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":" \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org/"}],"abstract":"With the year coming to a close, I couldn\u2019t help but reflect on our experiences in 2020 and 2021.

However, as the premise of RIS-assisted OFDM systems, the accuracy of channel estimation is severely degraded by the increased possibility of insufficient cyclic prefix (CP) produced by extra cascaded channels of RIS and the nonlinear distortion lead by imperfect hardware. To address these issues, an enhanced extreme learning machine (ELM)-based channel estimation (eELM-CE) is proposed in this letter to facilitate accurate channel estimation. Based on the model-driven mode, least square (LS) estimation is employed to highlight the initial linear features for channel estimation. Then, according to the obtained initial features, an enhanced ELM network is constructed to refine the channel estimation. In particular, we start from the perspective of guiding it to recognize the feature, and normalize the data after the network activation function to enhance the ability of identifying non-linear factors. Experiment results show that, compared with existing methods, the proposed method achieves a much lower normalized mean square error (NMSE) given insufficient CP and imperfect hardware. In addition, the simulation results indicate that the proposed method possesses robustness against the parameter variations.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","OFDM","Hardware","Estimation","Training","Nonlinear distortion","Standardization"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Insufficient cyclic prefix (CP)","reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)","extreme learning machine (ELM)","channel estimation","nonlinear distortion"]}],"doi":"10.1109/LCOMM.2021.3123736","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/4234/9674048/09591591.pdf","startPage":"153","endPage":"157","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9674048","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCOMM.2021.3123736","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Enhanced ELM Based Channel Estimation for RIS-Assisted OFDM Systems With Insufficient CP and Imperfect Hardware","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9591591","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Enhanced ELM Based Channel Estimation for RIS-Assisted OFDM Systems With Insufficient CP and Imperfect Hardware","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9591591/","volume":"26","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2022","htmlLink":"/document/9591591/","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"07 January 2022","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2022","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 October 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100012542","fundingName":"Sichuan Science and Technology Program","grantNumber":"2021JDRC0003"},{"fundingName":"Major Special Funds of Science and Technology of Sichuan Science and Technology Plan Project","grantNumber":"19ZDZX0016 /2019YFG0395"},{"fundingName":"Demonstration Project of Chengdu Major Science and Technology Application","grantNumber":"2020-YF09-00048-SN"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100008083","fundingName":"Key Scientific Research Fund of Xihua University","grantNumber":"Z1120941"},{"fundingName":"Special Funds of Industry Development of Sichuan Province","grantNumber":"zyf-2018-056"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Enhanced ELM Based Channel Estimation for RIS-Assisted OFDM Systems With Insufficient CP and Imperfect Hardware","sourcePdf":"lcomm-qing-3123736-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.060593S","chronDate":"Jan.  2022","xplore-pub-id":"4234","isNumber":"9674048","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4234","xplore-issue":"9674048","articleId":"9591591","onlineDate":"27 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2022","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-10"},{"_id":9591592,"authors":[{"name":"Li Zhang","affiliation":["CRRC Tangshan Company, Ltd., Tangshan, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/9312710/9591592/zhang-3123727-small.gif","p":["Li Zhang was born in 1984.

The existing maglev train charger usually uses the traditional PID controller to control the output of the charger which has a simple structure. To meet the requirements of the maglev train charger output performance which is getting higher and higher, it is necessary to optimize the control strategies which can achieve adaptive control of the system. In this paper, taking Qingyuan maglev train as the research object, the control principle of the charger of the maglev train is studied, and the simulation model of the charger of Qingyuan speed maglev train is built in MATLAB/Simulink. After verifying its feasibility, the paper proposes fuzzy PID control to improve the charger control method, and uses genetic algorithm to optimize fuzzy control membership function and fuzzy rules. Finally, the paper builds a fuzzy PID controller simulation model, compares the output performance of the charger under different control methods, and verifies the superiority of the new control method.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3123727","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/9312710/09591592.pdf","startPage":"152131","endPage":"152139","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3123727","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9312710","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Application Research of Fuzzy PID Control Optimized by Genetic Algorithm in Medium and Low Speed Maglev Train Charger","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9591592/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 October 2021","displayDocTitle":"Application Research of Fuzzy PID Control Optimized by Genetic Algorithm in Medium and Low Speed Maglev Train Charger","volume":"9","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"19 November 2021","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"2021","htmlLink":"/document/9591592/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Application Research of Fuzzy PID Control Optimized by Genetic Algorithm in Medium and Low Speed Maglev Train Charger","sourcePdf":"access-yang-3123727-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.056743S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"9312710","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","xplore-issue":"9312710","articleId":"9591592","onlineDate":"27 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":9591593,"authors":[{"name":"Jayadev Acharya","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Jayadev Acharya (Member, IEEE) received the Bachelor of Technology degree in electronics and electrical communication engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur, in 2007, and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical and computer engineering from the University of California at San Diego in 2009 and 2014, respectively.

We focus on the tasks of goodness-of-fit testing and estimation of discrete distributions. From prior work, these tasks are well understood under noninteractive protocols. Extending these approaches directly for interactive protocols is difficult due to correlations that can build due to interactivity; in fact, gaps can be found in prior claims of tight bounds of distribution estimation using interactive protocols. We propose a new approach to handle this correlation and establish a unified method to establish lower bounds for both tasks. As an application, we obtain optimal bounds for both estimation and testing under local differential privacy and communication constraints. We also provide an example of a natural testing problem where interactivity helps.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2022","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9591593/","volume":"68","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/9591593/","publicationDate":"Jan. 2022","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2021","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 October 2021","displayDocTitle":"Interactive Inference Under Information Constraints","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Grant NSF-CCF-1846300 (CAREER) and Grant NSF-CCF-1815893"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100006785","fundingName":"Google Faculty Fellowship"},{"fundingName":"Goldstine Postdoctoral Fellowship, IBM Research"},{"fundingName":"Grant NSF-CCF-1846300 (CAREER)"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100007780","fundingName":"Research Grant from the Robert Bosch Center for Cyberphysical Systems (RBCCPS), Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Interactive Inference Under Information Constraints","sourcePdf":"tit-canonne-3123905-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.10052S","chronDate":"Jan.  2022","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"9660615","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","xplore-issue":"9660615","articleId":"9591593","onlineDate":"27 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2022","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-22"},{"_id":9591599,"authors":[{"name":"Piero Angeletti","affiliation":["European Space Agency, Noordwijk, The Netherlands"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/9312710/9591599/angel-3123581-small.gif","p":["Piero Angeletti (Senior Member, IEEE) received the Laurea degree (summa cum laude) in electronics engineering from the University of Ancona, Italy, in 1996, and the Ph.D. degree in electromagnetism from the University of Rome \u201cLa Sapienza,\u201d Italy, in 2010.

Instead, the pragmatic M-MIMO with heuristic RRM is outperforming MMSE M-MIMO exploiting simple RRM.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 October 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9591599/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","volume":"9","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"2021","isOpenAccess":true,"dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9591599/","displayDocTitle":"Heuristic Radio Resource Management for Massive MIMO in Satellite Broadband Communication Networks","openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Heuristic Radio Resource Management for Massive MIMO in Satellite Broadband Communication Networks","sourcePdf":"access-degaudenzi-3123581-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.19858S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"9312710","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","xplore-issue":"9312710","articleId":"9591599","onlineDate":"27 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":9591617,"authors":[{"name":"Ignacio Trojaola","affiliation":["Ikerlan Technology Research Centre, Arrasate-Mondrag\u00f3n, Gipuzkoa, Spain"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/9312710/9591617/troja-3123668-small.gif","p":["Ignacio Trojaola received the degree in renewable energies engineering from the University of the Basque Country, Spain, and the M.Sc. degree in control and automation from Aalborg University, Denmark.

The MIMO ILC algorithm design is based on the inversion of the known low frequency dynamics of the hydraulic press, whereas the unknown and uncertain high frequency dynamics are discarded due to their low influence in the learning transient. Moreover, for the MIMO ILC convergence condition, a graphical method is proposed, in which the ILC learning filter eigenvalues are analyzed. This method allows studying the stability and convergence rate of the algorithm intuitively. Theoretical analysis and results prove that with the MIMO ILC algorithm the position control is automated and that high precision in the position tracking is gained. A comparison with other model inverse ILC approaches is carried out and it is shown that the proposed MIMO ILC algorithm outperforms the existing algorithms, reducing the number of iterations required to converge while guaranteeing system stability. Furthermore, experimental results in a hydraulic test rig are presented and compared to those obtained with a conventional PI controller.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3123668","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9312710","startPage":"146850","endPage":"146867","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/9312710/09591617.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Innovative MIMO Iterative Learning Control Approach for the Position Control of a Hydraulic Press","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9591617/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 October 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9591617/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"An Innovative MIMO Iterative Learning Control Approach for the Position Control of a Hydraulic Press","publicationDate":"2021","isOpenAccess":true,"dateOfInsertion":"13 November 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"9","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Department of Development and Infrastructures of the Government of the Basque Country via Industrial Doctorate Program BIKAINTEK","grantNumber":"20-AF-W2-2018-00015"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"An Innovative MIMO Iterative Learning Control Approach for the Position Control of a Hydraulic Press","sourcePdf":"access-trojaola-3123668-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.10344S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"9312710","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","xplore-issue":"9312710","articleId":"9591617","onlineDate":"27 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-11-11"},{"_id":9591641,"authors":[{"name":"Meng\u00fc\u00e7 \u00d6ner","affiliation":["University of Sussex, Brighton, U.K."],"firstName":"Meng\u00fc\u00e7","lastName":"\u00d6ner","orcid":"0000-0001-7797-8339"},{"name":"Esra Sorguven","affiliation":["University of Sussex, Brighton, U.K."],"firstName":"Esra","lastName":"Sorguven","orcid":"0000-0001-9618-1341"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"9591641","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":31},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"abstract":"Diffusive molecular communications (DMC) relies on the Brownian motion of dedicated molecules for transmitting information.

In this work, we investigate the directional signal propagation characteristics for a point source over (or, as a special case, on) a spherical surface, that may be reflective, perfectly absorptive or partially absorptive. We derive the general solution of the PDE for this case, and validate it via particle based simulations.

These advancements can result in a much safer commuting environment, reduced accidents and also eliminate the necessity for human driving. The creation of data and access to data for autonomous driving research is difficult challenge that research communities are facing.

The motivation of this study is to explore the different deep learning-based architectures used for image classification and object detection. There are various Convolutional Neural Networks(CNNs) based models that perform well for image classification where images are very similar to the dataset. But these models have certain Limitations if tilted or rotated images are processed for classification. Moreover, CNNs are unable to identify the location of different objects in an image. Therefore, to identify the location and recognize the object in the image along with bounding box information, region proposal based object detection algorithms (i.e., R-CNN, Fast R-CNN, Faster R-CNN, and Mask R-CNN) come into the picture. In these object detection algorithms, a bounding box is drawn around the object of interest to locate it within the image. This research article has explored these region-based models along with their pros and cons. Moreover, the performance and purpose of utilization for these object detection-based deep neural network has also been analyzed. Eventually, a summary is provided about these deep neural network-based architectures, where the suitability of a model(s) to solve a particular problem has been discussed.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9591759/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 Oct. 2021","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"7-9 Oct. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9591759/","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2021","publicationDate":"7 Oct. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Significance and Limitations of Deep Neural Networks for Image Classification and Object Detection","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Significance and Limitations of Deep Neural Networks for Image Classification and Object Detection","confLoc":"Trichy, India","sourcePdf":"251.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.160391S","chronDate":"7-9 Oct. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9591657","isNumber":"9591622","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9591657","xplore-issue":"9591622","articleId":"9591759","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-26"},{"_id":9591783,"authors":[{"name":"Meghana A","affiliation":["Computer Science and Engineering, Velagapudi Ramakrishna Siddhartha Engineering College, Vijayawada"],"firstName":"Meghana","lastName":"A","id":"37089029073"},{"name":"Sridhar K T V S","affiliation":["Computer Science and Engineering, Velagapudi Ramakrishna Siddhartha Engineering College, Vijayawada"],"firstName":"Sridhar K T V","lastName":"S","id":"37089029240"},{"name":"Manasa M","affiliation":["Computer Science and Engineering, Velagapudi Ramakrishna Siddhartha Engineering College, Vijayawada"],"firstName":"Manasa","lastName":"M","id":"37089028180"},{"name":"Sai Greeshmanth Ch","affiliation":["Computer Science and Engineering, Velagapudi Ramakrishna Siddhartha Engineering College, Vijayawada"],"firstName":"Sai Greeshmanth","lastName":"Ch","id":"37089028972"},{"name":"Rajeswari S","affiliation":["Computer Science and Engineering, Velagapudi Ramakrishna Siddhartha Engineering College, Vijayawada"],"firstName":"Rajeswari","lastName":"S","id":"37089029603"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3368-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"DVD ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3367-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3369-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9591783","dbTime":"1 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":16},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Deep learning","Road accidents","Costs","Roads","Manuals","Maintenance engineering","Inspection"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Road Damage","Deep Neural Networks","Yolov3","CNN"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9591783","abstract":"Roads play an important role in the economic development of a country. Along with economic development, they even provide social benefits such as traveling with ease and reduce the accidents caused due to poor road maintenance. With the above-said importance of the road, a means of transport, poorly maintained roads may reduce mobility and even lead to a significant increase in road accidents and vehicle operating cost. These cons of poor road maintenance emphasize the need for frequent and quick road damage detection. Road damage detection is an important part of road maintenance, which requires a huge manual effort to get the task done. This work can be done within a minimum time by developing a model that will be able to detect the type of cracks present in the image. In this project, the user is provided with an option to upload the damaged road image which is analyzed against the yolov3 model which can detect whether the road crack is among pothole, alligator crack, longitudinal crack, and lateral crack. This result will be stored in an excel sheet along with the location details of the road crack. Next to this, this research study defines the condition of the road b y using the same image as an input to a CNN model. In this way, a supervised deep neural network has been trained to detect road damage and save the data attained.","doi":"10.1109/ICOSEC51865.2021.9591783","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","publicationTitle":"2021 2nd International Conference on Smart Electronics and Communication (ICOSEC)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICOSEC51865.2021.9591783","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9591622","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 2nd International Conference on Smart Electronics and Communication (ICOSEC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9591657/9591622/09591783.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Classification of Road Cracks using Deep Neural Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9591783/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Classification of Road Cracks using Deep Neural Networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9591783/","publicationDate":"7 Oct. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2021","conferenceDate":"7-9 Oct. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 Oct. 2021","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Classification of Road Cracks using Deep Neural Networks","confLoc":"Trichy, India","sourcePdf":"51.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.101195S","chronDate":"7-9 Oct. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9591657","isNumber":"9591622","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9591657","xplore-issue":"9591622","articleId":"9591783","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":9591792,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Lately, wind power generation has developed quickly, and the exactness expectation of wind power generation is vital due to the effect on the security of power frameworks. Notwithstanding, the varieties of wind speeds is incredibly high, making the prediction of wind power generation very troublesome. Initially, correlation analysis of different input parameters is considered and the parameters with the higher correlation are scrutinized and then they are considered to be the ultimate inputs for prediction of wind speed. In this paper, errors are compared between two noted deep learning algorithms namely, Long Short -Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) and the final conclusion has shown that GRU gives better results compared to LSTM in predicting the wind speed. However, Both LSTM and GRU have their own set of pros and cons.","doi":"10.1109/ICOSEC51865.2021.9591886","pdfPath":"/iel7/9591657/9591622/09591886.pdf","startPage":"602","endPage":"607","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 2nd International Conference on Smart Electronics and Communication (ICOSEC)","publicationTitle":"2021 2nd International Conference on Smart Electronics and Communication (ICOSEC)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICOSEC51865.2021.9591886","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9591622","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Wind Speed Prediction Using Deep Learning-LSTM and GRU","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9591886/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 Oct. 2021","displayDocTitle":"Wind Speed Prediction Using Deep Learning-LSTM and GRU","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2021","publicationDate":"7 Oct. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9591886/","conferenceDate":"7-9 Oct. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wind Speed Prediction Using Deep Learning-LSTM and GRU","confLoc":"Trichy, India","sourcePdf":"102.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.083151S","chronDate":"7-9 Oct. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9591657","isNumber":"9591622","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9591657","xplore-issue":"9591622","articleId":"9591886","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":9591936,"authors":[{"name":"Srivardhini V","affiliation":["Sri Krishna College of Engineering and Technology, Coimbatore, India"],"firstName":"Srivardhini","lastName":"V","id":"37089028036"},{"name":"Sankavi M","affiliation":["Sri Krishna College of Engineering and Technology, Coimbatore, India"],"firstName":"Sankavi","lastName":"M","id":"37089028877"},{"name":"Sanjana S","affiliation":["Sri Krishna College of Engineering and Technology, Coimbatore, India"],"firstName":"Sanjana","lastName":"S","id":"37089029244"},{"name":"Kalaivani N","affiliation":["Sri Krishna College of Engineering and Technology, Coimbatore, India"],"firstName":"Kalaivani","lastName":"N","id":"37089028421"},{"name":"Dinesh Kumar J R","affiliation":["Sri Krishna College of Engineering and Technology, Coimbatore, India"],"firstName":"Dinesh Kumar J","lastName":"R","id":"37088928138"},{"name":"Ganesh Babu C","affiliation":["Institute of Technology, Sathy, India"],"firstName":"Ganesh Babu","lastName":"C","id":"37089026436"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3368-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"DVD ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3367-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3369-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9591936","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":13},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Deep learning","Neurological diseases","Machine learning algorithms","Magnetic resonance imaging","Prediction algorithms","Feature extraction","Classification algorithms"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Alzheimer\u2019s Disease","Deep Learning","Convolutional Neural Network","MRI","MCI"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9591936","doi":"10.1109/ICOSEC51865.2021.9591936","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICOSEC51865.2021.9591936","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9591622","publicationTitle":"2021 2nd International Conference on Smart Electronics and Communication (ICOSEC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 2nd International Conference on Smart Electronics and Communication (ICOSEC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9591657/9591622/09591936.pdf","startPage":"1048","endPage":"1055","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Deep Learning Based Multi-model for Early prognosticate of Alzheimer\u2019s Dementia using MRI Dataset","abstract":"Alzheimer\u2019s disease involves the death of neurons in the brain, which leads to the patient\u2019s memory loss.

DL algorithms operate well with massive datasets, which is very useful in cases like AD. Also, the proposed research work has used the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) technique to classify and identify diseases by using MRI images, with a total of 2560 normal images, 1792 MCI images, 717 early AD images, and 52 late AD portrayals.5121 photos were utilised to train the data and 1279 images were tested once the data had been trained.

A study of the size of wildfires in a Canadian Province in USA i.e. Alberta is seen in this article. A variation of the duration of the fire and the area it burns defines the scale of a fire. Our predictive algorithm helps wildfire rescue workers to use their foreseen level in the initial phases in order to mitigate destruction inflicted by a forest fire. Modeling information has been gathered from Natural Resources Canada's real-time dataset, including forest fire and weather information for Alberta, Canada. To evaluate the severity of flames, the dimensions of the region affected with fire and the timeframe of the flames have been used. The information was split into training and evaluation environments after multi-linearity validation and function normalization. In addition, the climatic variables were used to create predictive model by using inputs, a Neural Network for Back Propagation (BPNN), a type of artificial neural network i.e. Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) and a type of RNN i.e. Long Short-Term memory (LSTM). LSTM showed the greatest precision, 95.9 percent, of these classification models. The findings suggest that the scope of a wildfire can be forecast using climatic knowledge at the outset of the event.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9591952/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 Oct. 2021","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"7-9 Oct. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9591952/","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2021","publicationDate":"7 Oct. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Leveraging Machine Learning to Predict Wild Fires","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Leveraging Machine Learning to Predict Wild Fires","confLoc":"Trichy, India","sourcePdf":"242.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062507S","chronDate":"7-9 Oct. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9591657","isNumber":"9591622","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9591657","xplore-issue":"9591622","articleId":"9591952","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-26"},{"_id":9592012,"authors":[{"name":"Rajesh Kannan Megalingam","affiliation":["Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham, Amritapuri, India"],"firstName":"Rajesh Kannan","lastName":"Megalingam","id":"37394324100"},{"name":"Dasari Hema Teja Anirudh Babu","affiliation":["Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham, Amritapuri, India"],"firstName":"Dasari Hema Teja Anirudh","lastName":"Babu","id":"37089029987"},{"name":"Ghali Sriram","affiliation":["Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham, Amritapuri, India"],"firstName":"Ghali","lastName":"Sriram","id":"37089027656"},{"name":"Venkata Sai YashwanthAvvari","affiliation":["University of Twente, The Netherlands"],"firstName":"Venkata Sai","lastName":"YashwanthAvvari","id":"37089027723"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-1668-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-1669-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2329-6259"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2329-6232"}],"articleNumber":"9592012","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":16},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9592012","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Planets","Neural networks","Signal processing algorithms","Object detection","Streaming media","Signal processing","Real-time systems"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["YOLOv3","CNN","Deep Neural Networks","image classification","image localization","object detection","bounding boxes","anchor boxes"]}],"doi":"10.1109/STSIVA53688.2021.9592012","pdfPath":"/iel7/9591664/9591665/09592012.pdf","publicationTitle":"2021 XXIII Symposium on Image, Signal Processing and Artificial Vision (STSIVA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 XXIII Symposium on Image, Signal Processing and Artificial Vision (STSIVA)","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9591665","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/STSIVA53688.2021.9592012","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Concurrent Detection and Identification of Multiple Objects using YOLO Algorithm","abstract":"The main purpose of this research paper is to study and report how the object detection and identification of multiple objects in an image or a video frameworks in real life.

To realize the promised potentials, advanced resource allocation design plays a decisive role in revealing, understanding, and exploiting the intrinsic rate\u2013energy tradeoff capitalizing on the dual use of radio frequency (RF) signals for wireless charging and communication. In this article, we provide a comprehensive tutorial overview of SWIPT from the perspective of resource allocation design. The fundamental concepts, system architectures, and RF energy harvesting (EH) models are introduced. In particular, three commonly adopted EH models, namely, the linear EH model, the nonlinear saturation EH model, and the nonlinear circuit-based EH model, are characterized and discussed. Then, for a typical wireless system setup, we establish a generalized resource allocation design framework that subsumes conventional resource allocation design problems as special cases. Subsequently, we elaborate on relevant tools from optimization theory and exploit them for solving representative resource allocation design problems for SWIPT systems with and without perfect channel state information (CSI) available at the transmitter, respectively. The associated technical challenges and insights are also highlighted. Furthermore, we discuss several promising and exciting future research directions for resource allocation design for SWIPT systems intertwined with cutting-edge communication technologies, such as intelligent reflecting surfaces, unmanned aerial vehicles, mobile edge computing, federated learning, and machine learning.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wireless communication","Resource management","Wireless sensor networks","Integrated circuit modeling","Radio frequency","Systems architecture","RF signals","Wireless power transfer","Energy harvesting"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Optimization","resource allocation","simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT)","wireless power transfer (WPT)"]}],"doi":"10.1109/JPROC.2021.3120888","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel7/5/9675003/09592187.pdf","startPage":"127","endPage":"149","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9675003","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JPROC.2021.3120888","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Resource Allocation for Simultaneous Wireless Information and Power Transfer Systems: A Tutorial Overview","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9592187","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Resource Allocation for Simultaneous Wireless Information and Power Transfer Systems: A Tutorial Overview","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9592187/","volume":"110","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2022","htmlLink":"/document/9592187/","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"07 January 2022","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2022","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 October 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100005156","fundingName":"Alexander von Humboldt Foundation"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001773","fundingName":"UNSW Digital Grid Futures Institute, University of New South Wales (UNSW), Sydney, through the Cross-Disciplinary Fund Scheme"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000923","fundingName":"Australian Research Council\u2019s Discovery Project","grantNumber":"DP210102169"},{"fundingName":"German Science Foundation","grantNumber":"SCHO 831/12-1, SFB 1483 and 442419336, EmpkinS"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Resource Allocation for Simultaneous Wireless Information and Power Transfer Systems: A Tutorial Overview","sourcePdf":"jproc-yu-3120888-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.188038S","chronDate":"Jan.  2022","xplore-pub-id":"5","isNumber":"9675003","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","xplore-issue":"9675003","articleId":"9592187","onlineDate":"28 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2022","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-10"},{"_id":9592447,"authors":[{"name":"Wen Qin","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Technology, Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Chongqing Institute of Green and Intelligent Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Chongqing School, University of Chinese, Academy of Sciences, Chongqing, China"],"firstName":"Wen","lastName":"Qin","id":"37087104478"},{"name":"Xin Luo","affiliation":["Chongqing Institute of Green and Intelligent Technology, Chinese, Academy of Sciences, Hengrui (Chongqing) Artificial Intelligence Research Center, Cloudwalk, China"],"firstName":"Xin","lastName":"Luo","id":"38581292400"},{"name":"MengChu Zhou","affiliation":["New Jersey Institute of Technology, Newark, USA"],"firstName":"MengChu","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37273591600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-1683-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-1684-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2474-2473"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2474-8137"}],"articleNumber":"9592447","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":4},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9592447","abstract":"Latent factor analysis (LFA) is highly efficient in knowledge discovery from high-dimensional and sparse (HiDS) matrices frequently encountered in big data and web service related applications. A stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithm is commonly adopted as a learning algorithm for LFA owing to its high efficiency. However, its sequential nature makes it less scalable when processing large-scale data. Although an alternating SGD algorithm decouples an LFA process to achieve parallelization, its performance relies on its hyper-parameter selection that is highly expensive to tune. To address it, this paper presents three adaptive alternating SGD algorithms, thus leading to three Parallel Adaptive LFA (PAL) models for LFA on large-scale HiDS matrices. Experimental studies on HiDS matrices from industrial service applications show that the proposed PAL models perform significantly better than existing ones in terms of both convergence rate and computational efficiency, as well as achieve competitive prediction accuracy for missing data.","doi":"10.1109/SCC53864.2021.00041","startPage":"285","endPage":"290","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Conference on Services Computing (SCC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9592361/9592191/09592447.pdf","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Conference on Services Computing (SCC)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SCC53864.2021.00041","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9592191","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Alternating Stochastic Gradient Descent Algorithms for Large-Scale Latent Factor Analysis","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Analytical models","Adaptation models","Web services","Computational modeling","Stochastic processes","Service computing"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Latent Factor Analysis","High-Dimensional and Sparse Matrix","Quality of Service","Stochastic gradient descent"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9592447/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-10 Sept. 2021","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Alternating Stochastic Gradient Descent Algorithms for Large-Scale Latent Factor Analysis","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9592447/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2021","conferenceDate":"5-10 Sept. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Alternating Stochastic Gradient Descent Algorithms for Large-Scale Latent Factor Analysis","confLoc":"Chicago, IL, USA","sourcePdf":"168300a285.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.08953S","chronDate":"5-10 Sept. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9592361","isNumber":"9592191","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9592361","xplore-issue":"9592191","articleId":"9592447","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":9592511,"authors":[{"name":"Zengmei Zhuo","affiliation":["Chinese Academy of Sciences, Chongqing, 400714, China","University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100049, China"],"firstName":"Zengmei","lastName":"Zhuo","id":"37089017081"},{"name":"Xin Luo","affiliation":["Chinese Academy of Sciences, Chongqing, 400714, China"],"firstName":"Xin","lastName":"Luo","id":"38581292400"},{"name":"MengChu Zhou","affiliation":["New Jersey Institute of Technology, Newark, New Jersy 07102, USA"],"firstName":"MengChu","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37273591600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-0058-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-0059-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9592511","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":7},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9592511","abstract":"Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) play a vital role in graph learning tasks such as semi-supervised learning.

We investigated using symbolic GR(1) controller synthesis for automating multi-robot task planning. Given a specification of the order of tasks and states to avoid, often multiple valid strategies can be computed; in many states there are multiple choices to satisfy the specification, such as choosing different robots to perform a certain task. To determine the best choices under the consideration of movement times and probabilities that robots may be interrupted for repairs or corrections, we combine the execution of the synthesized controller with Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), a heuristic AI-planning technique. The result is a model-at-run-time approach that we present by the example of a multi-robot spot welding cell. We report on experiments showing that the approach (1) can reduce cycle times by choosing time-efficient movement sequences and (2) can choose executions that react efficiently to interruptions by choosing to delay tasks that, if an interruption of one robot should occur later, can be reallocated to another robot. Most interestingly, we found, however, that (3) in some cases there is a conflict between time-efficient movement sequences and ones that may react efficiently to probable future interruptions\u2014and when interruption probabilities are low, increasing the time allocated for MCTS, i.e., increasing the number of sample simulations made by MCTS, does not improve cycle time.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9592517/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-15 Oct. 2021","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"10-15 Oct. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9592517/","dateOfInsertion":"13 November 2021","publicationDate":"Oct. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Monte Carlo Tree Search and GR(1) Synthesis for Robot Tasks Planning in Automotive Production Lines","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Monte Carlo Tree Search and GR(1) Synthesis for Robot Tasks Planning in Automotive Production Lines","confLoc":"Fukuoka, Japan","sourcePdf":"349500a320.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.108902S","chronDate":"10-15 Oct. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9592360","isNumber":"9592189","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9592360","xplore-issue":"9592189","articleId":"9592517","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-26"},{"_id":9592540,"authors":[{"name":"Seung-Cheol Han","affiliation":["School of EECS, Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology, Gwangju, Republic of Korea"],"firstName":"Seung-Cheol","lastName":"Han","id":"37087046898"},{"name":"Jonghyun Choi","affiliation":["AI Graduate School, Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology, Gwangju, Republic of Korea"],"firstName":"Jonghyun","lastName":"Choi","id":"37088545947"},{"name":"Sung-Min Hong","affiliation":["School of EECS, Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology, Gwangju, Republic of Korea"],"firstName":"Sung-Min","lastName":"Hong","id":"37404680000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-0685-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-0686-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1946-1577"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"1946-1569"}],"articleNumber":"9592540","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":27},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","MOSFET","Solid modeling","Electric potential","Three-dimensional displays","Tensors","Simulation"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9592540","abstract":"We propose to use a 3D convolutional neural network to accelerate three-dimensional device simulation by generating an electrostatic potential profile.

While Cloud service providers recognize the evolving mission-critical requirements in latency sensitive verticals such as autonomous driving, multimedia, gaming, telecommunications, and virtual reality, there is a wide gap to bridge the Quality of Service (QoS) constraints for the end-user experience. Most latency-critical services are over-provisioned on all fronts to offer reliability, which is inefficient towards scalability in the long run. To address this, we propose a strategy to model frequent violations on the application level as a multi-output target to enable more complex decision-making in the management of virtualised communication networks. In this work, we utilize data from a real-world deployment to configure and draft a realistic set of Service Level Objectives (SLOs) for a voice based NFV application, and develop a deep neural network based multi-label classification methodology to identify and predict multiple categories of SLO breaches associated with an application state. With this, we aim to gain granular SLA and SLO violation insights, enabling us to study and mitigate their impact and inform precision in drafting proactive scaling policies. We further compare the performance against a set of multi-label compatible machine learning classifiers, and address class imbalance in a multi-label setup. We perform a comprehensive evaluation to assess the performance on example-based, label-based and ranking-based measures, and demonstrate the suitability of deep learning in such a use-case.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9309127","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/OJCOMS.2021.3122844","publicationTitle":"IEEE Open Journal of the Communications Society","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Open Journal of the Communications Society","pdfPath":"/iel7/8782661/9309127/09592636.pdf","startPage":"2469","endPage":"2493","doi":"10.1109/OJCOMS.2021.3122844","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Deep Neural Network-Based Multi-Label Classifier for SLA Violation Prediction in a Latency Sensitive NFV Application","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","displayDocTitle":"A Deep Neural Network-Based Multi-Label Classifier for SLA Violation Prediction in a Latency Sensitive NFV Application","volume":"2","htmlLink":"/document/9592636/","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"2021","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9592636/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 October 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001602","fundingName":"Science Foundation Ireland (SFI) through the European Regional Development Fund","grantNumber":"13/RC/2077"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"A Deep Neural Network-Based Multi-Label Classifier for SLA Violation Prediction in a Latency Sensitive NFV Application","sourcePdf":"ojcoms-jalodia-3122844-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.13285S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"8782661","isNumber":"9309127","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8782661","xplore-issue":"9309127","articleId":"9592636","onlineDate":"28 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBYNCND","lastupdate":"2021-12-26"},{"_id":9592684,"authors":[{"name":"Chua-Chin Wang","affiliation":["Institute of Undersea Technology, National Sun Yat-sen University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chua-Chin","lastName":"Wang","orcid":"0000-0002-2426-2879"},{"name":"Ralph Gerard B.

Nevertheless, in several real applications, it may be easier to detect a given event from audio information, and the use of audio surveillance systems can greatly improve the robustness and reliability of event detection. In this paper, a novel system for the detection of polyphonic urban noise is proposed for on-campus audio surveillance. The system aggregates different acoustic features to improve the classification accuracy of urban noise. A combination model composed of a capsule neural network (CapsNet) and recurrent neural network (RNN) is employed as the classifier. CapsNet overcomes some limitations of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), such as the loss of position information after max-pooling, and the RNN mainly models the temporal dependency of context information. The combination of these networks further improves the accuracy and robustness of polyphonic sound events detection. Moreover, a monitoring platform is designed to visualize noise maps and acoustic event information. The deployment architecture of the system is used in real environments, and experiments were also conducted on two public datasets. The results demonstrate that the proposed method is superior to existing state-of-art methods for the polyphonic sound event detection task.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3123970","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3123970","startPage":"147900","endPage":"147913","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/9312710/09592754.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9312710","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A System for the Detection of Polyphonic Sound on a University Campus Based on CapsNet-RNN","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 October 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","displayDocTitle":"A System for the Detection of Polyphonic Sound on a University Campus Based on CapsNet-RNN","publicationDate":"2021","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2021","volume":"9","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9592754/","isOpenAccess":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9592754/","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Subsidization of the Project of Guangxi Technology Base and Talent Special Project","grantNumber":"GuiKeAD20159018"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004607","fundingName":"Project of Guangxi Natural Science Foundation","grantNumber":"2020GXNSFAA159004"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61771151"},{"fundingName":"Guangxi Keypoint Research and Invention Program","grantNumber":"AB17292058"},{"fundingName":"Innovation Project of GUET Graduate Education","grantNumber":"2021YCXS024"},{"fundingName":"Director Fund for Provincial Ministry of Education Key Laboratory of Cognitive Radio and Signal Processing","grantNumber":"CRKL200104"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"A System for the Detection of Polyphonic Sound on a University Campus Based on CapsNet-RNN","sourcePdf":"access-zhang-3123970-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.159987S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"9312710","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","xplore-issue":"9312710","articleId":"9592754","onlineDate":"29 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-12-26"},{"_id":9592755,"authors":[{"name":"Neng Zhang","affiliation":["Wuhan Nari Ltd., Liability Company of State Grid Power Research Institute, Wuhan, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/9312710/9592755/zhang-3124051-small.gif","p":["Neng Zhang was born in Hubei, China, in 1984.

The proposed technique is tested on the Nordic test system, and the results indicate that the proposed approach can provide fast and accurate recognition of instable mode and has a certain prospect of online application.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power system stability","Transient analysis","Rotors","Generators","Stability criteria","Clustering algorithms","Data models"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Transient stability","KODAMA algorithm","XGBoost algorithm","machine learning"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3124051","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/9312710/09592755.pdf","startPage":"154172","endPage":"154182","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9312710","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3124051","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Data-Driven Method for Power System Transient Instability Mode Identification Based on Knowledge Discovery and XGBoost Algorithm","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9592755","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Data-Driven Method for Power System Transient Instability Mode Identification Based on Knowledge Discovery and XGBoost Algorithm","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9592755/","volume":"9","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"2021","htmlLink":"/document/9592755/","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"23 November 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 October 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"A Data-Driven Method for Power System Transient Instability Mode Identification Based on Knowledge Discovery and XGBoost Algorithm","sourcePdf":"access-zhang-3124051-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.112597S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"9312710","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","xplore-issue":"9312710","articleId":"9592755","onlineDate":"29 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-12-26"},{"_id":9592757,"authors":[{"name":"Bingxin Hou","affiliation":["Santa Clara University, Santa Clara, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/9312710/9592757/hou-3123975-small.gif","p":["Bingxin Hou (Student Member, IEEE) received the M.S. degree in imaging science from the Rochester Institute of Technology, Rochester, NY, USA, in 2010.

However, many existing models render superior detection accuracy at the cost of high computational complexity and slow inference speed. This fact has hindered the development of such models in mobile and embedded vision tasks, which need to be carried out in a timely fashion on a computationally limited platform. In this paper, we propose a super-fast (inference speed-154 fps) and lightweight (model size-1.45 MB) end-to-end 3D separable convolutional neural network with a multi-input multi-output (MIMO) strategy named \u201c3DS_MM\u201d for moving object detection. To improve detection accuracy, the proposed model adopts 3D convolution which is more suitable to extract both spatial and temporal information in video data than 2D convolution. To reduce model size and computational complexity, the standard 3D convolution is decomposed into depthwise and pointwise convolutions. Besides, we proposed a MIMO strategy to increase inference speed, which can take multiple frames as the network input and output multiple frames of detection results. Further, we conducted the scene dependent evaluation (SDE) and scene independent evaluation (SIE) on the benchmark CDnet2014 and DAVIS2016 datasets. Compared to state-of-the-art approaches, our proposed method significantly increases the inference speed, reduces the model size, meanwhile achieving the highest detection accuracy in the SDE setup and maintaining a competitive detection accuracy in the SIE setup.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9592757/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 October 2021","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"volume":"9","htmlLink":"/document/9592757/","publicationDate":"2021","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Fast Lightweight 3D Separable Convolutional Neural Network With Multi-Input Multi-Output for Moving Object Detection","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Kwai, Inc., under the Kwai, Inc.

To this end, it is crucial to adjust the phases of reflecting elements of the IRS, and most of the research works focus on how to optimize/quantize the phase for different optimization objectives. In particular, the quantized phase shift (QPS) is assumed to be available at the IRS, which, however, does not always hold and should be fed back to the IRS in practice. Unfortunately, the feedback channel is generally bandwidth-limited, which cannot support a huge amount of feedback overhead of the QPS particularly for a large number of reflecting elements and/or the quantization level of each reflecting element. In order to break this bottleneck, in this letter, we propose a convolutional autoencoder-based scheme, in which the QPS is compressed on the receiver side and reconstructed on the IRS side. In order to solve the problems of mismatched distribution and vanishing gradient, we remove the batch normalization (BN) layers and introduce a denoising module. By doing so, it is possible to achieve a high compression ratio with a reliable reconstruction accuracy in the bandwidth-limited feedback channel, and it is also possible to accommodate existing works assuming available QPS at the IRS. Simulation results confirm the high reconstruction accuracy of the feedback/compressed QPS through a feedback channel, and show that the proposed scheme can significantly outperform the existing compression algorithms.","doi":"10.1109/LCOMM.2021.3123941","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCOMM.2021.3123941","startPage":"89","endPage":"93","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/4234/9674048/09592779.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9674048","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Convolutional Autoencoder-Based Phase Shift Feedback Compression for Intelligent Reflecting Surface-Assisted Wireless Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 October 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2022","displayDocTitle":"Convolutional Autoencoder-Based Phase Shift Feedback Compression for Intelligent Reflecting Surface-Assisted Wireless Systems","publicationDate":"Jan. 2022","dateOfInsertion":"07 January 2022","volume":"26","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9592779/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9592779/","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"The Science and Technology Development Fund, Macau SAR","grantNumber":"0003/2019/A1, 0018/2019/AMJ, 0009/2020/A1 and 0110/2020/A3"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61601071 and 62071078"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Convolutional Autoencoder-Based Phase Shift Feedback Compression for Intelligent Reflecting Surface-Assisted Wireless Systems","sourcePdf":"lcomm-li-3123941-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.048716S","chronDate":"Jan.  2022","xplore-pub-id":"4234","isNumber":"9674048","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4234","xplore-issue":"9674048","articleId":"9592779","onlineDate":"29 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2022","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-10"},{"_id":9592784,"authors":[{"name":"Jianhong Chu","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Networking and Switching Technology, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (BUPT), Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jianhong","lastName":"Chu","orcid":"0000-0003-1360-3284"},{"name":"Zhi Zhang","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Networking and Switching Technology, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (BUPT), Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zhi","lastName":"Zhang","orcid":"0000-0001-8672-6766"},{"name":"Yuzhen Huang","affiliation":["Artificial Intelligence Research Center, National Innovation Institute of Defense Technology, Beijing, China","School of Information and Communication, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yuzhen","lastName":"Huang","orcid":"0000-0002-9536-7918"},{"name":"Yu Guo","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Networking and Switching Technology, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (BUPT), Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yu","lastName":"Guo","orcid":"0000-0001-6282-5161"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"9592784","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":48},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Estimation","Apertures","Direction-of-arrival estimation","Array signal processing","Sensor arrays","Sensors","Delay effects"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["CLA","array motion","VCPA","DOA estimation","synthetic aperture"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9592784","doi":"10.1109/LCOMM.2021.3123976","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCOMM.2021.3123976","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9674048","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/4234/9674048/09592784.pdf","startPage":"69","endPage":"73","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Novel Approach of 2-D DOA Estimation by Employing Coprime Linear Array Motion","abstract":"In this letter, we explore the feature of coprime linear array (CLA) motion for enhanced array aperture and higher degree of freedom (DOF) by implementing synthetic aperture processing. Since the traditional fixed CLA cannot achieve two-dimensional (2-D) DOA estimation, we propose a novel approach to construct the virtual coprime planar array (VCPA) just by the CLA motion. Specifically, the CLA moves along the vertical direction at a constant velocity and the two subarrays of CLA are controlled to snap at different time delays related to the coprime number of sensors, by which the received signals at different time delays are synthetically processed to construct a VCPA. Simulation results demonstrate that: a) our proposed approach outperforms the synthetic CLA moving along the direction of layout of the initial arrays on DOF and the dimension of DOA estimation; b) the proposed VCPA can achieve 2-D DOA estimation just by the motive CLA and achieve no worse performance than the practical coprime planar array but by using fewer sensors.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9592784/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2022","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 October 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9592784/","dateOfInsertion":"07 January 2022","publicationDate":"Jan. 2022","volume":"26","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A Novel Approach of 2-D DOA Estimation by Employing Coprime Linear Array Motion","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100018537","fundingName":"National Science and Technology Major Project","grantNumber":"2018ZX03001009"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61629101"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel Approach of 2-D DOA Estimation by Employing Coprime Linear Array Motion","sourcePdf":"lcomm-zhang-3123976-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.063434S","chronDate":"Jan.  2022","xplore-pub-id":"4234","isNumber":"9674048","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4234","xplore-issue":"9674048","articleId":"9592784","onlineDate":"29 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2022","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-10"},{"_id":9592785,"authors":[{"name":"Kento Aida","affiliation":["Keio University, Yokohama, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/9312710/9592785/aida-3124024-small.gif","p":["Kento Aida received the B.E. degree in electronics and electrical engineering and the M.E. degree in integrated design engineering from Keio University, Japan, in 2019 and 2021, respectively."]},"firstName":"Kento","lastName":"Aida","id":"37089026108"},{"name":"Kenta Yamada","affiliation":["Keio University, Yokohama, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/9312710/9592785/yamad-3124024-small.gif","p":["Kenta Yamada received the B.E. degree in electronics and electrical engineering and the M.E. degree in integrated design engineering from Keio University, Japan, in 2017 and 2019, respectively."]},"firstName":"Kenta","lastName":"Yamada","id":"37086962883"},{"name":"Ryosuke Hotchi","affiliation":["Keio University, Yokohama, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/9312710/9592785/hotch-3124024-small.gif","p":["Ryosuke Hotchi received the B.E. degree in electronics and electrical engineering and the M.E. and Ph.D. degrees in integrated design engineering from Keio University, Japan, in 2016, 2018, and 2021, respectively.

A system that can function while being immune to cyberattacks is necessary. A method called fixed redundant path selection (FRPS) has been proposed to detect and mitigate data tampering attacks in a networked motion control system. This system contains redundant forward network paths from the controller to the motor sides to detect the attacked path by comparing the values that are received through respective paths. Then, a path selector on the motor side chooses a value on the path that is not attacked based on the majority decision. Increasing the number of redundant paths improves the detection performance of simultaneous attacks against multiple paths. However, it also increases the amount of traffic because the same data are transmitted to all of the redundant paths. This study proposes a dynamic redundant path selection (DRPS) method to balance the detection performance and the amount of traffic. The proposed method initially applies three redundant paths and changes the number of redundant paths to five only when the path selector detects a difference among the received values for the three paths. The experiments confirm that the proposed DRPS outperforms the conventional FRPS. The former can detect and mitigate the data tampering attacks while reducing the number of network paths during tampering detection when the system is exposed to simultaneous attacks against up to two of the redundant paths.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3124024","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3124024","startPage":"147430","endPage":"147441","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/9312710/09592785.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9312710","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamic Network Path Provisioning and Selection for the Detection and Mitigation of Data Tampering Attacks in Networked Control Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 October 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic Network Path Provisioning and Selection for the Detection and Mitigation of Data Tampering Attacks in Networked Control Systems","publicationDate":"2021","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2021","volume":"9","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9592785/","isOpenAccess":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9592785/","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001691","fundingName":"JSPS KAKENHI","grantNumber":"18K11275"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Dynamic Network Path Provisioning and Selection for the Detection and Mitigation of Data Tampering Attacks in Networked Control Systems","sourcePdf":"access-kubo-3124024-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.095762S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"9312710","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","xplore-issue":"9312710","articleId":"9592785","onlineDate":"29 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-12-26"},{"_id":9592789,"authors":[{"name":"Long Ma","affiliation":["School of Information and Control Engineering, Qingdao University of Technology, Qingdao, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/9312710/9592789/ma-3124090-small.gif","p":["Long Ma (Graduate Student Member, IEEE) received the B.Eng. degree in communication engineering from Hangzhou Dianzi University, Hangzhou, China, in 2018.

It is well known that there is a strong connection between these entropic quantities and submodularity since entropy over a set of random variables is submodular. In this paper, we study combinatorial information measures that generalize independence, (conditional) entropy, (conditional) mutual information, and total correlation defined over sets of (not necessarily random) variables. These measures strictly generalize the corresponding entropic measures since they are all parameterized via submodular functions that themselves strictly generalize entropy. Critically, we show that, unlike entropic mutual information in general, the submodular mutual information is actually submodular in one argument, holding the other fixed, for a large class of submodular functions whose third-order partial derivatives satisfy a non-negativity property. This turns out to include a number of practically useful cases such as the facility location and set-cover functions. We study specific instantiations of the submodular information measures on these, as well as the probabilistic coverage, graph-cut, log-determinants, and saturated coverage functions and see that they all have mathematically intuitive and practically useful expressions. Finally, we also study generalized independence between subsets of datapoints (random variables in the entropic case), and connect the independence characterizations to independence in log-submodular distributions. Regarding applications, we connect the maximization of submodular (conditional) mutual information to problems such as mutual-information-based, query-based, and privacy preserving summarization\u2014and we connect optimizing the multi-set submodular mutual information to clustering and robust partitioning. We perform real world as well as synthetic experiments on various data summarization tasks.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9592798/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 October 2021","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2022","volume":"68","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2022","publicationDate":"Feb. 2022","htmlLink":"/document/9592798/","displayDocTitle":"Generalized Submodular Information Measures: Theoretical Properties, Examples, Optimization Algorithms, and Applications","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"IIS-2106937"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100006785","fundingName":"Google"},{"fundingName":"Adobe"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"IIS-2106937"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000028","fundingName":"CONIX Research Center, one of six centers in Joint University Microelectronics Program (JUMP), a Semiconductor Research Corporation (SRC) Program"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000185","fundingName":"Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA)"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Generalized Submodular Information Measures: Theoretical Properties, Examples, Optimization Algorithms, and Applications","sourcePdf":"tit-iyer-3123944-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.25192S","chronDate":"Feb.  2022","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"9687099","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","xplore-issue":"9687099","articleId":"9592798","onlineDate":"29 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2022","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-25"},{"_id":9592799,"authors":[{"name":"Tam\u00e1s H\u00e9ger","affiliation":["ELKH\u2013ELTE Geometric and Algebraic Combinatorics Research Group, ELTE E\u00f6tv\u00f6s Lor\u00e1nd University, Budapest, Hungary"],"firstName":"Tam\u00e1s","lastName":"H\u00e9ger","orcid":"0000-0002-9586-966X","id":"37089252240"},{"name":"Zolt\u00e1n L\u00f3r\u00e1nt Nagy","affiliation":["ELKH\u2013ELTE Geometric and Algebraic Combinatorics Research Group, ELTE E\u00f6tv\u00f6s Lor\u00e1nd University, Budapest, Hungary"],"firstName":"Zolt\u00e1n L\u00f3r\u00e1nt","lastName":"Nagy","orcid":"0000-0003-2062-5668","id":"37089250571"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9448"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9654"}],"articleNumber":"9592799","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":19},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Information Theory Society","url":"http://www.itsoc.org/"}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Short Minimal Codes and Covering Codes via Strong Blocking Sets in Projective Spaces","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9592799","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Codes","Error correction codes","Linear codes","Upper bound","Probabilistic logic","Terminology","Technological innovation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Linear code","minimal code","covering code","saturating set","cutting blocking set","higgledy-piggledy line set"]}],"abstract":"Minimal linear codes are in one-to-one correspondence with special types of blocking sets of projective spaces over a finite field, which are called strong or cutting blocking sets.

It provides an effective guarantee with respect to welding quality in shipbuilding, chemical industry, and aerospace applications. A variety of related computer-based image processing technologies have been designed for the detection of weld defects. However, this is a challenging task because weld defects can exhibit different shapes, sizes, positions, and contrasts in radiographic images. This article proposes an end-to-end weld defect recognition method that mainly includes three steps. In the first step, we propose an improved algorithm based on deep belief network (DBN), which classifies weld feature curves extracted by applying infinite norm for detecting defective weld base on radiographic images. In the second step, a new cylindrical projection method is proposed to increase the proportion of defect parts in the images and solve the problem of loss of defects with small size. And in the third step, we propose an improved deep learning network that is based on SegNet to identify weld defects. Experimental verification shows that this method can realize end-to-end weld defect recognition and strong robustness. Compared with existing methods, this method exhibits obvious advantages and can effectively assist inspectors in welding defect detection and significantly improve the detection efficiency of industrial nondestructive testing.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Welding","Image segmentation","Radiography","Deep learning","Image edge detection","Classification algorithms","Semantics"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cylindrical projection","deep belief network (DBN)","deep learning","image processing","welding defect"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TIM.2021.3124053","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","pdfPath":"/iel7/19/9259274/09592811.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"11","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9259274","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIM.2021.3124053","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Deep Learning-Based Weld Defect Classification Method Using Radiographic Images With a Cylindrical Projection","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9592811","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Deep Learning-Based Weld Defect Classification Method Using Radiographic Images With a Cylindrical Projection","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9592811/","volume":"70","externalId":"5018911","publicationDate":"2021","htmlLink":"/document/9592811/","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 October 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Deep Learning-Based Weld Defect Classification Method Using Radiographic Images With a Cylindrical Projection","sourcePdf":"tim-chang-3124053-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.09592S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"19","isNumber":"9259274","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"19","xplore-issue":"9259274","articleId":"9592811","onlineDate":"29 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-26"},{"_id":9592875,"authors":[{"name":"Rongqing Hui","affiliation":["University of Kansas, Lawrence, USA"],"firstName":"Rongqing","lastName":"Hui","id":"37276273700"},{"name":"Govind Vedala","affiliation":["University of Kansas, Lawrence, USA"],"firstName":"Govind","lastName":"Vedala","id":"37086101123"},{"name":"Arin Dutta","affiliation":["University of Kansas, Lawrence, USA"],"firstName":"Arin","lastName":"Dutta","id":"37088896215"},{"name":"Youichi Akasaka","affiliation":["Fujitsu Network Communications,Richardson,Texas,75082"],"firstName":"Youichi","lastName":"Akasaka","id":"37399475800"},{"name":"Paparao Palacharla","affiliation":["Fujitsu Network Communications,Richardson,Texas,75082"],"firstName":"Paparao","lastName":"Palacharla","id":"37374270100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-1601-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4676-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2575-274X"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2374-0140"}],"articleNumber":"9592875","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":27},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9592875","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Stimulated emission","Conferences","Optical pumping","Fabry-Perot","Optical amplifiers","Pump lasers","Photonics"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["OCIS codes","(060.1660) Coherent communications","(140.4480) Optical amplifiers","(140.3550) Lasers","Raman"]}],"abstract":"We present a pilot-aided digital compensation technique to mitigate the impact of pump RIN-transfer in forward-pumped distributed Raman amplification systems.

Particularly, based on the Type I codebook introduced by 3GPP and the two feedback values (i.e., precoder matrix indicator (PMI) and channel quality indicator (CQI)), base station (BS) aims at acquiring the optimal beamforming vector. Different from previous schemes that focus on the exploitation of PMI, this paper firstly reveals the link between the optimal beamforming vector and CQI, and then devises an intelligent tuning-free algorithm that can learn both the beamforming vector and the associated regularization parameter from the collected CQIs. Numerical results based on channel samples from QUAsi Deterministic RadIo channel GenerAtor (QuaDRiGa) have shown the excellent performance of the proposed algorithm in terms of both beamforming vector acquisition and regularization parameter learning.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 Sept. 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9593098/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9593098/","publicationDate":"27 Sept. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2021","conferenceDate":"27-30 Sept. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Learning Enhanced Beamforming Vector From CQIs in 5G NR FDD Massive MIMO Systems: A Tuning-free Approach","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100017412","fundingName":"BD"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100006190","fundingName":"Research and Development"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Learning Enhanced Beamforming Vector From CQIs in 5G NR FDD Massive MIMO Systems: A Tuning-free Approach","confLoc":"Lucca, Italy","sourcePdf":"1570716577.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.086867S","chronDate":"27-30 Sept. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9593094","isNumber":"9593095","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9593094","xplore-issue":"9593095","articleId":"9593098","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":9593109,"authors":[{"name":"Jiabei Fan","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Integrated Service Networks (ISN), Xidian University, Shaanxi, China"],"firstName":"Jiabei","lastName":"Fan","id":"37089030081"},{"name":"Rui Chen","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Integrated Service Networks (ISN), Xidian University, Shaanxi, China","National Mobile Communication Research Laboratory, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Rui","lastName":"Chen","id":"37088445906"},{"name":"Wen-Xuan Long","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Integrated Service Networks (ISN), Xidian University, Shaanxi, China","University of Pisa, Italy"],"firstName":"Wen-Xuan","lastName":"Long","id":"37086523030"},{"name":"Marco Moretti","affiliation":["University of Pisa, Italy"],"firstName":"Marco","lastName":"Moretti","id":"37302219500"},{"name":"Jiandong Li","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Integrated Service Networks (ISN), Xidian University, Shaanxi, China"],"firstName":"Jiandong","lastName":"Li","id":"37279843400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-2851-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-2852-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1948-3252"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"1948-3244"}],"articleNumber":"9593109","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":56},"abstract":"Orbital angular momentum (OAM) at radiofrequency provides a novel approach of multiplexing a set of orthogonal modes on the same frequency channel to achieve high spectral efficiencies. However, classical phase gradient-based OAM mode detection methods require perfect alignment of transmit and receive antennas, which greatly challenges the practical application of OAM communications. In this paper, we first show the effect of non-parallel misalignment on the OAM phase structure, and then propose the OAM mode detection method based on uniform circular array (UCA) samples learning for the more general alignment or non-parallel misalignment case. Specifically, we applied three classifiers: K-nearest neighbor (KNN), support vector machine (SVM), and back-propagation neural network (BPNN) to both single-mode and multi-mode OAM detection. The simulation results validate that the proposed learning-based OAM mode detection methods are robust to misalignment errors and especially BPNN classifier has the best generalization performance.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Support vector machines","Radio frequency","Wireless communication","Training","Spectral efficiency","Simulation","Supervised learning"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Orbital angular momentum (OAM)","mode detection","machine learning","misalignment","uniform circular array (UCA)"]}],"doi":"10.1109/SPAWC51858.2021.9593109","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 22nd International Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications (SPAWC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 22nd International Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications (SPAWC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9593094/9593095/09593109.pdf","startPage":"56","endPage":"60","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9593095","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPAWC51858.2021.9593109","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Radio-Frequency Multi-Mode OAM Detection Based on UCA Samples Learning","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9593109","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Radio-Frequency Multi-Mode OAM Detection Based on UCA Samples Learning","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9593109/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"27 Sept. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9593109/","conferenceDate":"27-30 Sept. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 Sept. 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003453","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100008081","fundingName":"Southeast University"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100012226","fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100005320","fundingName":"Xidian University"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Radio-Frequency Multi-Mode OAM Detection Based on UCA Samples Learning","confLoc":"Lucca, Italy","sourcePdf":"1570716467.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062058S","chronDate":"27-30 Sept. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9593094","isNumber":"9593095","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9593094","xplore-issue":"9593095","articleId":"9593109","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-26"},{"_id":9593123,"authors":[{"name":"Dario Tagliaferri","affiliation":["Politecnico di Milano, Milan, Italy"],"firstName":"Dario","lastName":"Tagliaferri","id":"38233824300"},{"name":"Marouan Mizmizi","affiliation":["Politecnico di Milano, Milan, Italy"],"firstName":"Marouan","lastName":"Mizmizi","id":"37086201197"},{"name":"Damiano Badini","affiliation":["Huawei Technologies Italia S.r.l., Segrate, Italy"],"firstName":"Damiano","lastName":"Badini","id":"37088718666"},{"name":"Christian Mazzucco","affiliation":["Huawei Technologies Italia S.r.l., Segrate, Italy"],"firstName":"Christian","lastName":"Mazzucco","id":"37085754648"},{"name":"Umberto Spagnolini","affiliation":["Politecnico di Milano, Milan, Italy"],"firstName":"Umberto","lastName":"Spagnolini","id":"37269649600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-2851-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-2852-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1948-3252"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"1948-3244"}],"articleNumber":"9593123","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":41},"abstract":"Channel knowledge is a fundamental requirement for accurate analog-digital beamforming in hybrid MIMO systems.

We propose a two-stage channel estimation procedure for 6G Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) systems, leveraging multiple recurrent vehicle passages over the same location, properly clustered in space, in both the analog beam training (stage 1) and the algebraic digital channel estimation (stage 2).

Recent work has introduced data-driven design methods that leverage graph neural network (GNN) to efficiently parametrize the power control policy mapping channel state information (CSI) to the power vector. The specific GNN architecture, known as random edge GNN (REGNN), defines a non-linear graph convolutional architecture whose spatial weights are tied to the channel coefficients, enabling a direct adaption to channel conditions. This paper studies the higher-level problem of enabling fast adaption of the power control policy to time-varying topologies. To this end, we apply first-order meta-learning on data from multiple topologies with the aim of optimizing for a few-shot adaptation to new network configurations.","doi":"10.1109/SPAWC51858.2021.9593131","startPage":"146","endPage":"150","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 22nd International Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications (SPAWC)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPAWC51858.2021.9593131","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9593095","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 22nd International Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications (SPAWC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9593094/9593095/09593131.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fast Power Control Adaptation via Meta-Learning for Random Edge Graph Neural Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9593131/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Fast Power Control Adaptation via Meta-Learning for Random Edge Graph Neural Networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9593131/","publicationDate":"27 Sept. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2021","conferenceDate":"27-30 Sept. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 Sept. 2021","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000781","fundingName":"European Research Council"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast Power Control Adaptation via Meta-Learning for Random Edge Graph Neural Networks","confLoc":"Lucca, Italy","sourcePdf":"1570720289.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07385S","chronDate":"27-30 Sept. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9593094","isNumber":"9593095","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9593094","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"9593095","articleId":"9593131","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":9593138,"authors":[{"name":"Spilios Evmorfos","affiliation":["Rutgers University, Piscataway, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Spilios","lastName":"Evmorfos","id":"37089029211"},{"name":"Konstantinos Diamantaras","affiliation":["International Hellenic University, Thessaloniki, Greece"],"firstName":"Konstantinos","lastName":"Diamantaras","id":"37284720000"},{"name":"Athina Petropulu","affiliation":["Rutgers University, Piscataway, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Athina","lastName":"Petropulu","id":"37284953400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-2851-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-2852-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1948-3252"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"1948-3244"}],"articleNumber":"9593138","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wireless communication","Array signal processing","Signal processing algorithms","Interference","Aerospace electronics","Channel models","Relays"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["mobile relay beamforming","relay motion policies","deep Q Learning","Fourier feature mapping"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Deep Q Learning With Fourier Feature Mapping For Mobile Relay Beamforming Networks","doi":"10.1109/SPAWC51858.2021.9593138","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9593095","endPage":"130","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 22nd International Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications (SPAWC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 22nd International Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications (SPAWC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9593094/9593095/09593138.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPAWC51858.2021.9593138","startPage":"126","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9593138","abstract":"The paper addresses motion control of mobile relays implementing cooperative beamforming in a time- and space- varying channel environment. The relays move in a time-slotted fashion and movement is confined within a 2D rectangular plane, discretized on a fine grid. In each time slot, the relays optimally beamform to maximize the Signal-to-Interference+Noise Ratio (SINR) at the destination, subject to power constraints, and determine their optimal next slot positions to which they move by the end of the slot. Prior works have assumed the availability of statistical channel models, which were used to predictively compute the optimal next slot relay positions. In this paper, we propose a novel, model-free, deep Q learning approach to govern relay motion policies, which drops all assumptions on channel model statistics and allows relays to learn solely from experience. Due to the randomness of the channels, the Q function is highly varying with respect to state and action. To facilitate the learning of Q, we propose to apply Fourier mapping of the state with a Gaussian matrix. Via simulations, we show that this approach leads to significant improvement in convergence and SINR performance, as compared to using the state directly.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9593138/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 Sept. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"27 Sept. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9593138/","conferenceDate":"27-30 Sept. 2021","displayDocTitle":"Deep Q Learning With Fourier Feature Mapping For Mobile Relay Beamforming Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Deep Q Learning With Fourier Feature Mapping For Mobile Relay Beamforming Networks","confLoc":"Lucca, Italy","sourcePdf":"1570716433.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.092416S","chronDate":"27-30 Sept. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9593094","isNumber":"9593095","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9593094","xplore-issue":"9593095","articleId":"9593138","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-17"},{"_id":9593140,"authors":[{"name":"Zipeng Wang","affiliation":["Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Zipeng","lastName":"Wang","id":"37089027704"},{"name":"Li Tan","affiliation":["Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Li","lastName":"Tan","id":"37291567600"},{"name":"Haifan Yin","affiliation":["Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Haifan","lastName":"Yin","id":"38493026100"},{"name":"Kai Wang","affiliation":["Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Kai","lastName":"Wang","id":"37402605800"},{"name":"Xilong Pei","affiliation":["Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Xilong","lastName":"Pei","id":"37089027196"},{"name":"David Gesbert","affiliation":["EURECOM, Sophia-Antipolis, France"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Gesbert","id":"37274459900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-2851-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-2852-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1948-3252"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"1948-3244"}],"articleNumber":"9593140","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":29},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9593140","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wireless communication","Industries","Power measurement","Scattering","Radar","Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces","Signal processing"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Reconfigurable intelligent surface","RIS","IRS","passive scattering elements","received power model","validations"]}],"doi":"10.1109/SPAWC51858.2021.9593140","pdfPath":"/iel7/9593094/9593095/09593140.pdf","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 22nd International Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications (SPAWC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 22nd International Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications (SPAWC)","startPage":"561","endPage":"565","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9593095","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPAWC51858.2021.9593140","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Received Power Model for Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface and Measurement-based Validations","abstract":"The idea of using a Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS) consisting of a large array of passive scattering elements to assist wireless communication systems has recently attracted much attention from academia and industry. A central issue with RIS is how much power they can effectively convey to the target radio nodes. Regarding this question, several power level models exist in the literature but few have been validated through experiments. In this paper, we propose a radar cross section-based received power model for an RIS-aided wireless communication system that is rooted in the physical properties of RIS. Our proposed model follows the intuition that the received power is related to the distances from the transmitter/receiver to the RIS, the angles in the TX-RIS-RX triangle, the effective area of each element, and the reflection coefficient of each element. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first to model the angle-dependent phase shift of the reflection coefficient, which is typically ignored in existing literature. We further measure the received power with our experimental platform in different scenarios to validate our model. The measurement results show that our model is appropriate both in near field and far field and can characterize the impact of angles well.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 Sept. 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9593140/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9593140/","publicationDate":"27 Sept. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2021","conferenceDate":"27-30 Sept. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Received Power Model for Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface and Measurement-based Validations","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Received Power Model for Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface and Measurement-based Validations","confLoc":"Lucca, Italy","sourcePdf":"1570716237.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059407S","chronDate":"27-30 Sept. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9593094","isNumber":"9593095","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9593094","xplore-issue":"9593095","articleId":"9593140","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":9593150,"authors":[{"name":"Ziyue Wang","affiliation":["School of Mathematical Sciences, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China","LSEC, ICMSEC, Academy of Mathematics and Systems Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Ziyue","lastName":"Wang","id":"37088931666"},{"name":"Ya-Feng Liu","affiliation":["LSEC, ICMSEC, Academy of Mathematics and Systems Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Ya-Feng","lastName":"Liu","id":"37598255800"},{"name":"Zhilin Chen","affiliation":["University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada"],"firstName":"Zhilin","lastName":"Chen","id":"37086172026"},{"name":"Wei Yu","affiliation":["University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Yu","id":"37279838900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-2851-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-2852-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1948-3252"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"1948-3244"}],"articleNumber":"9593150","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":39},"abstract":"We propose a computationally efficient algorithm for the device activity detection problem in the multi-cell massive multi-input multi-output (MIMO) system, where the active devices transmit their signature sequences to multiple BSs in multiple cells and all the BSs cooperate to detect the active devices. The device activity detection problem has been formulated as a maximum likelihood maximization (MLE) problem in the literature. The state-of-the-art algorithm for solving the problem is the (random) coordinate descent (CD) algorithm. However, the CD algorithm fails to exploit the special sparsity structure of the solution of the device activity detection problem, i.e., most of devices are not active in each time slot. In this paper, we propose a novel active set selection strategy to accelerate the CD algorithm and propose an efficient active set CD algorithm for solving the considered problem. Specifically, at each iteration, the proposed active set CD algorithm first selects a small subset of all devices, namely the active set, which contains a few devices that contribute the most to the deviation from the first-order optimality condition of the MLE problem thus potentially can provide the most improvement to the objective function, then applies the CD algorithm to perform the detection for the devices in the active set. Simulation results show that the proposed active set CD algorithm significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art CD algorithm in terms of the computational efficiency.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wireless communication","Performance evaluation","Maximum likelihood estimation","Maximum likelihood detection","Simulation","Signal processing algorithms","Massive MIMO"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Active set","coordinate descent","device activity detection","massive random access"]}],"doi":"10.1109/SPAWC51858.2021.9593150","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 22nd International Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications (SPAWC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 22nd International Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications (SPAWC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9593094/9593095/09593150.pdf","startPage":"366","endPage":"370","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9593095","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPAWC51858.2021.9593150","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Accelerating Coordinate Descent via Active Set Selection for Device Activity Detection for Multi-Cell Massive Random Access","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9593150","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Accelerating Coordinate Descent via Active Set Selection for Device Activity Detection for Multi-Cell Massive Random Access","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9593150/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"27 Sept. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9593150/","conferenceDate":"27-30 Sept. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 Sept. 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Accelerating Coordinate Descent via Active Set Selection for Device Activity Detection for Multi-Cell Massive Random Access","confLoc":"Lucca, Italy","sourcePdf":"1570717991.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077839S","chronDate":"27-30 Sept. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9593094","isNumber":"9593095","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9593094","xplore-issue":"9593095","articleId":"9593150","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-26"},{"_id":9593152,"authors":[{"name":"Mathieu Goutay","affiliation":["Nokia Bell Labs, Paris-Saclay, Nozay, France","INSA Lyon, Inria, CITI, Universit\u00e9 de Lyon, Villeurbanne, France"],"firstName":"Mathieu","lastName":"Goutay","id":"37086457154"},{"name":"Fay\u00e7al Ait Aoudia","affiliation":["Nokia Bell Labs, Paris-Saclay, Nozay, France"],"firstName":"Fay\u00e7al Ait","lastName":"Aoudia","id":"37085615895"},{"name":"Jakob Hoydis","affiliation":["Nvidia, Sophia Antipolis, France"],"firstName":"Jakob","lastName":"Hoydis","id":"37573341600"},{"name":"Jean-Marie Gorce","affiliation":["INSA Lyon, Inria, CITI, Universit\u00e9 de Lyon, Villeurbanne, France"],"firstName":"Jean-Marie","lastName":"Gorce","id":"37264985500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-2851-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-2852-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1948-3252"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"1948-3244"}],"articleNumber":"9593152","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":29},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9593152","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wireless communication","Error analysis","Scalability","OFDM","Channel estimation","Receivers","Computer architecture"]}],"abstract":"Machine learning (ML) can be used in various ways to improve multi-user multiple-input multiple-output (MU-MIMO) receive processing.

In this paper, we propose the concept of Hybrid RISs (HRISs), which do not solely reflect the impinging waveform in a controllable fashion, but are also capable of sensing and processing a portion of it via some active reception elements. We first present implementation details for this novel metasurface architecture and propose a simple model for its operation, when considered for wireless communications. As an indicative application of HRISs, we formulate and solve the individual channels identification problem for the uplink of multi-user HRIS-empowered systems.

In this paper, we consider a fully digital base station equipped with 1-bit analog-to-digital (in uplink) and digital-to-analog (in downlink) converters on each radio frequency chain. The base station communicates with multiple single antenna users with individual SINR constraints. We present a linear solution to the multi-user downlink beamforming problem based on the uplink down-link duality principle. The proposed solution takes into account the hardware constraints and jointly optimizes the downlink beamformers and the power allocated to each user. Detailed simulations carried out using 3GPP channel models generated from Quadriga show that our proposed solution outperforms state of the art solutions in terms of the ergodic sum and minimum capacity especially when the number of users is large.","doi":"10.1109/SPAWC51858.2021.9593205","startPage":"376","endPage":"380","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 22nd International Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications (SPAWC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9593094/9593095/09593205.pdf","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 22nd International Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications (SPAWC)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPAWC51858.2021.9593205","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9593095","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-user Downlink Beamforming using Uplink Downlink Duality with 1-bit Converters","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wireless communication","Base stations","Quantization (signal)","Power demand","Array signal processing","Interference","Downlink"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["1-bit ADC","1-bit DAC","multi-user beamforming"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9593205/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 Sept. 2021","displayDocTitle":"Multi-user Downlink Beamforming using Uplink Downlink Duality with 1-bit Converters","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9593205/","publicationDate":"27 Sept. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2021","conferenceDate":"27-30 Sept. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100004358","fundingName":"Samsung"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-user Downlink Beamforming using Uplink Downlink Duality with 1-bit Converters","confLoc":"Lucca, Italy","sourcePdf":"1570716233.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.080383S","chronDate":"27-30 Sept. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9593094","isNumber":"9593095","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9593094","xplore-issue":"9593095","articleId":"9593205","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":9593207,"authors":[{"name":"Fran\u00e7ois Rottenberg","affiliation":["Universit\u00e9 Catholique de Louvain, Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgium","Universit\u00e9 Libre de Bruxelles, Brussels, Belgium"],"firstName":"Fran\u00e7ois","lastName":"Rottenberg","id":"37085773852"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-2851-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-2852-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1948-3252"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"1948-3244"}],"articleNumber":"9593207","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Wireless communication","Conferences","Massive MIMO","Signal processing","Downlink","Antennas"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Secret-key generation","Massive MIMO","training design"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9593207","doi":"10.1109/SPAWC51858.2021.9593207","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 22nd International Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications (SPAWC)","abstract":"In this paper, the secret-key capacity is max-imized by optimizing the downlink training sequence in a time division duplexing (TDD) massive multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) scenario.

In the multiple-user case, both the max-min and the sum capacity criteria are considered, including potential user priorities.

Additionally, we introduce a penalty term to promote a low cross-correlation among synthesized waveforms. Many commonly-used radar code families contain only a limited number of sequences of a certain length. In modern radar applications, such as multifunction, MIMO, and cognitive radars, this may reduce the achievable performance gains. These systems launch multiple waveforms simultaneously in order to deal with low observable targets or large numbers of small targets. Therefore, the synthesis of novel waveforms and waveform families is important. Generating new waveforms on demand is also beneficial in scenarios where an adversary attempts to detect or recognize launched waveforms. We develop a conditional Wasserstein GAN (WGAN) for multiple datasets of complex-valued input data with varying code lengths. For each dataset, the model aims to synthesize waveforms with the same length and AF shape as the waveforms in that dataset. The model is trained to synthesize two classes of waveforms with different lengths using Frank and Oppermann codes. The AF shapes of synthesized waveforms are nearly identical to those of the training data. Additionally, the proposed penalty term allows for a tradeoff between the AF fidelity of synthesized samples and the expected cross-correlation among synthesized waveforms.","doi":"10.1109/SPAWC51858.2021.9593211","startPage":"456","endPage":"460","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 22nd International Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications (SPAWC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9593094/9593095/09593211.pdf","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 22nd International Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications (SPAWC)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPAWC51858.2021.9593211","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9593095","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Generative Adversarial Network for Variable-Length Sensing Waveform Synthesis","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Wireless communication","Codes","Shape","Training data","Signal processing","Generative adversarial networks"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9593211/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 Sept. 2021","displayDocTitle":"Generative Adversarial Network for Variable-Length Sensing Waveform Synthesis","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9593211/","publicationDate":"27 Sept. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2021","conferenceDate":"27-30 Sept. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Generative Adversarial Network for Variable-Length Sensing Waveform Synthesis","confLoc":"Lucca, Italy","sourcePdf":"1570716050.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051216S","chronDate":"27-30 Sept. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9593094","isNumber":"9593095","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9593094","xplore-issue":"9593095","articleId":"9593211","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":9593216,"authors":[{"name":"Benedikt Fesl","affiliation":["Professur f\u00fcr Methoden der Signalverarbeitung, Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen, Munich, Germany"],"firstName":"Benedikt","lastName":"Fesl","id":"37088879467"},{"name":"Nurettin Turan","affiliation":["Professur f\u00fcr Methoden der Signalverarbeitung, Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen, Munich, Germany"],"firstName":"Nurettin","lastName":"Turan","id":"37088445722"},{"name":"Michael Koller","affiliation":["Professur f\u00fcr Methoden der Signalverarbeitung, Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen, Munich, Germany"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Koller","id":"37890806100"},{"name":"Wolfgang Utschick","affiliation":["Professur f\u00fcr Methoden der Signalverarbeitung, Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen, Munich, Germany"],"firstName":"Wolfgang","lastName":"Utschick","id":"37273316200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-2851-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-2852-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1948-3252"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"1948-3244"}],"articleNumber":"9593216","dbTime":"1 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9593216","abstract":"A convolutional neural network estimator which learns the minimum mean squared error channel estimator for single-antenna users was recently proposed. We generalize the architecture to the estimation of MIMO channels with multiple-antenna users and incorporate assumptions, such as a high number of antennas and a single propagation cluster, which reduces the computational complexity tremendously. Learning is used in this context to combat the mismatch between the assumptions and real scenarios with a limited number of antennas and many propagation clusters. We derive a high-level description of the estimator for arbitrary choices of the pilot sequence. It turns out that the proposed estimator has the implicit structure of a two-layered convolutional neural network, where the derived quantities can be relaxed to learnable parameters. We show that by using discrete Fourier transform based pilots the number of network parameters decreases significantly and the online run time of the estimator is reduced considerably, where we can achieve linearithmic order of complexity in the number of antennas. Numerical results display performance gains compared to state-of-the-art algorithms from the field of compressive sensing or covariance estimation of the same or higher computational complexity. The simulation code is available online.","doi":"10.1109/SPAWC51858.2021.9593216","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9593095","startPage":"11","endPage":"15","pdfPath":"/iel7/9593094/9593095/09593216.pdf","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 22nd International Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications (SPAWC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 22nd International Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications (SPAWC)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPAWC51858.2021.9593216","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Low-Complexity MIMO Channel Estimator with Implicit Structure of a Convolutional Neural Network","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wireless communication","Channel estimation","Signal processing algorithms","Computer architecture","Performance gain","Convolutional neural networks","Computational complexity"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Channel estimation","massive MIMO","machine learning","neural networks","spatial channel model"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 Sept. 2021","displayDocTitle":"A Low-Complexity MIMO Channel Estimator with Implicit Structure of a Convolutional Neural Network","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9593216/","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2021","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9593216/","publicationDate":"27 Sept. 2021","conferenceDate":"27-30 Sept. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Low-Complexity MIMO Channel Estimator with Implicit Structure of a Convolutional Neural Network","confLoc":"Lucca, Italy","sourcePdf":"1570716129.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061776S","chronDate":"27-30 Sept. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9593094","isNumber":"9593095","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9593094","xplore-issue":"9593095","articleId":"9593216","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-19"},{"_id":9593231,"authors":[{"name":"Jennifer Simonjan","affiliation":["Silicon Austria Labs, Graz, Austria"],"firstName":"Jennifer","lastName":"Simonjan","id":"37085592905"},{"name":"Bige D.

Previous works have studied the spatial distribution of this distortion for a central massive multiple input multiple output (MIMO) array. In this work, we extend the analysis for distributed massive MIMO in a line-of-sight (LoS) scenario. We show that the distortion is not always uniformly distributed in space. In the single-user case, it coherently combines at the user location. In the few users case, the signals will add up at the user locations plus several others locations. As the number of users increases, it becomes close to uniformly distributed. As a comparison with a central massive MIMO system, having the same total number of antennas, the distortion in distributed massive MIMO is considerably more uniformly distributed in space. Moreover, the potential coherent combining is contained in a zone rather than in generic directions, i.e., in a beamspot. Furthermore, a small-scale fading effect is observed at unintended locations due to the non-coherent combining of the signals. As a result, one can expect that going towards distributed systems allows working closer to saturation, increasing the PA operating efficiency and/or using low-cost PAs.","doi":"10.1109/SPAWC51858.2021.9593246","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 22nd International Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications (SPAWC)","startPage":"76","endPage":"80","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPAWC51858.2021.9593246","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9593095","pdfPath":"/iel7/9593094/9593095/09593246.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 22nd International Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications (SPAWC)","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fading channels","Wireless communication","Graphical models","Conferences","Nonlinear distortion","Power amplifiers","Massive MIMO"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Distributed massive MIMO","non linear power amplification","distortion"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Spatial Distribution of Distortion due to Nonlinear Power Amplification in Distributed Massive MIMO","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9593246/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9593246/","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2021","publicationDate":"27 Sept. 2021","conferenceDate":"27-30 Sept. 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 Sept. 2021","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spatial Distribution of Distortion due to Nonlinear Power Amplification in Distributed Massive MIMO","confLoc":"Lucca, Italy","sourcePdf":"1570715417.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052721S","chronDate":"27-30 Sept. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9593094","isNumber":"9593095","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9593094","xplore-issue":"9593095","articleId":"9593246","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-17"},{"_id":9593249,"authors":[{"name":"Ghassan M.

Our results show, in both cases, the superiority of CQAM compared to known modulation schemes (i.e. QAM, PSK, and PAM) in terms of error rate and energy harvesting.","doi":"10.1109/SPAWC51858.2021.9593249","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPAWC51858.2021.9593249","startPage":"616","endPage":"620","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 22nd International Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications (SPAWC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9593094/9593095/09593249.pdf","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 22nd International Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications (SPAWC)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9593095","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fundamentals of Circular QAM for Wireless Information and Power Transfer","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 Sept. 2021","displayDocTitle":"Fundamentals of Circular QAM for Wireless Information and Power Transfer","conferenceDate":"27-30 Sept. 2021","publicationDate":"27 Sept. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2021","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9593249/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9593249/","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000781","fundingName":"European Research Council"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fundamentals of Circular QAM for Wireless Information and Power Transfer","confLoc":"Lucca, Italy","sourcePdf":"1570716134.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069098S","chronDate":"27-30 Sept. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9593094","isNumber":"9593095","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9593094","xplore-issue":"9593095","articleId":"9593249","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-26"},{"_id":9593251,"authors":[{"name":"Wenzhi Fang","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Technology, ShanghaiTech University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Wenzhi","lastName":"Fang","id":"37088664406"},{"name":"Yinan Zou","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Technology, ShanghaiTech University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Yinan","lastName":"Zou","id":"37089028398"},{"name":"Hongbin Zhu","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Technology, ShanghaiTech University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Hongbin","lastName":"Zhu","id":"37085991776"},{"name":"Yuanming Shi","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Technology, ShanghaiTech University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Yuanming","lastName":"Shi","id":"38666276500"},{"name":"Yong Zhou","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Technology, ShanghaiTech University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Yong","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37072016300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-2851-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-2852-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1948-3252"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"1948-3244"}],"articleNumber":"9593251","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":17},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9593251","abstract":"In this paper, we consider fast wireless data aggregation via over-the-air computation (AirComp) in Internet of Things (IoT) networks, where an access point (AP) with multiple antennas aim to recover the arithmetic mean of sensory data from multiple IoT devices. To minimize the estimation distortion, we formulate a mean-squared-error (MSE) minimization problem that involves the joint optimization of the transmit scalars at the IoT devices as well as the denoising factor and the receive beamforming vector at the AP. To this end, we derive the transmit scalars and the denoising factor in closed-form, resulting in a non-convex quadratic constrained quadratic programming (QCQP) problem concerning the receive beamforming vector. Different from the existing studies that only obtain sub-optimal beamformers, we propose a branch and bound (BnB) algorithm to design the globally optimal receive beamformer. Extensive simulations demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed algorithm in terms of MSE. Moreover, the proposed BnB algorithm can serve as a benchmark to evaluate the performance of the existing sub-optimal algorithms.","doi":"10.1109/SPAWC51858.2021.9593251","startPage":"61","endPage":"65","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 22nd International Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications (SPAWC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9593094/9593095/09593251.pdf","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 22nd International Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications (SPAWC)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPAWC51858.2021.9593251","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9593095","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal Receive Beamforming for Over-the-Air Computation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wireless communication","Wireless sensor networks","Array signal processing","Noise reduction","Signal processing algorithms","Benchmark testing","Minimization"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9593251/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 Sept. 2021","displayDocTitle":"Optimal Receive Beamforming for Over-the-Air Computation","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9593251/","publicationDate":"27 Sept. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2021","conferenceDate":"27-30 Sept. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal Receive Beamforming for Over-the-Air Computation","confLoc":"Lucca, Italy","sourcePdf":"1570719998.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062036S","chronDate":"27-30 Sept. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9593094","isNumber":"9593095","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9593094","xplore-issue":"9593095","articleId":"9593251","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":9593276,"authors":[{"name":"Emily Naviasky","affiliation":["University of California at Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/9625642/9593276/navia-3118641-small.gif","p":["Emily Naviasky (Student Member, IEEE) received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering and B.S. degree in computer science from the University of Maryland, College Park, MD, USA, in 2014.

This paper proposes a deep-learning based approach to achieve two-way dynamic focusing in plane wave imaging, which improves the image quality of plane wave, particularly in image contrast. This method takes advantage of the complete dataset of synthetic transmit aperture (STA) imaging, by building the linear relationship between the channel data of plane waves with apodizations and the complete dataset of STA. A customized network is proposed to train a set of optimized plane wave apodization coefficients, and to recover the complete dataset of STA from the channel data of apodized plane waves. Compared with a similar method using fixed apodizations and compressed-sensing (CS) based dataset recovery in in-vivo experiments, the proposed method significantly improves the contrast ratio (CR) by around 9 dB and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) by around 6 dB. Meanwhile, the computational time of dataset recovery is reduced from thousands of seconds to less than 2 seconds.","doi":"10.1109/IUS52206.2021.9593334","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Ultrasonics Symposium (IUS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9593294/9593298/09593334.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9593298","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IUS52206.2021.9593334","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Ultrasonics Symposium (IUS)","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Self-supervised Deep Learning Approach for High Frame Rate Plane Wave Beamforming with Two-way Dynamic Focusing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9593334","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-16 Sept. 2021","displayDocTitle":"A Self-supervised Deep Learning Approach for High Frame Rate Plane Wave Beamforming with Two-way Dynamic Focusing","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9593334/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9593334/","publicationDate":"11 Sept. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2021","conferenceDate":"11-16 Sept. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"62001403,61871251,61971367"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003392","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Fujian Province","grantNumber":"2020J05003"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100012226","fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"20720200093,20720210097"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Self-supervised Deep Learning Approach for High Frame Rate Plane Wave Beamforming with Two-way Dynamic Focusing","confLoc":"Xi'an, China","sourcePdf":"5042.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056063S","chronDate":"11-16 Sept. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9593294","isNumber":"9593298","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9593294","xplore-issue":"9593298","articleId":"9593334","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-16"},{"_id":9593368,"authors":[{"name":"Megan Yociss","affiliation":["University of Texas at Dallas, Richardson, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Megan","lastName":"Yociss","id":"37089027112"},{"name":"Katherine Brown","affiliation":["University of Texas at Dallas, Richardson, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Katherine","lastName":"Brown","id":"37087118530"},{"name":"Kenneth Hoyt","affiliation":["University of Texas at Dallas, Richardson, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Kenneth","lastName":"Hoyt","id":"37300295400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-0355-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4777-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1948-5727"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"1948-5719"}],"articleNumber":"9593368","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Ultrasonic imaging","Image resolution","Transducers","Array signal processing","Phantoms","Imaging phantoms","Arrays"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["contrast-enhanced ultrasound","matrix array","microbubble contrast agents","null subtraction beamforming"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9593368","doi":"10.1109/IUS52206.2021.9593368","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Ultrasonics Symposium (IUS)","abstract":"Contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) is a vascular imaging technique that has several clinical and preclinical applications. It is generally performed in 2-dimensional (2-D) space, which is not ideal for imaging complicated blood vessel networks. Alternatively, volumetric data can be acquired at a high frame rate with 2-D matrix arrays, although the image quality is reduced. Alternatives to conventional delay-and-sum (DAS) beamforming can be used to compensate for the poor resolution and high side lobe levels. The purpose of this research was to determine if the recently developed null subtraction beamforming technique can improve vessel resolution during volumetric CEUS imaging. A tissue-mimicking phantom with a 2.5 mm vessel lumen was perfused with a microbubble contrast agent and imaged with a programmable US scanner (Vantage 256, Verasonics Inc) equipped with a 1024-element matrix array transducer (7.5 MHz, Vermon). Volumetric data was acquired and beamformed with both null subtraction and conventional DAS. The resulting temporal maximum intensity projections were compared. Qualitatively, the vessel lumen was clearer and side lobe noise was greatly reduced by null subtraction beamforming. The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the vessel was also improved from 9.8 dB for DAS to 13.3 dB for null subtraction. Null subtraction beamforming is a simple technique that improves the quality of volumetric CEUS images acquired using a 2-D matrix array transducer.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IUS52206.2021.9593368","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9593298","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Ultrasonics Symposium (IUS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9593294/9593298/09593368.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Null Subtraction Beamforming for Improved Vessel Resolution in Volumetric Contrast-Enhanced Ultrasound","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9593368/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-16 Sept. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9593368/","displayDocTitle":"Null Subtraction Beamforming for Improved Vessel Resolution in Volumetric Contrast-Enhanced Ultrasound","conferenceDate":"11-16 Sept. 2021","publicationDate":"11 Sept. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000002","fundingName":"National Institutes of Health (NIH)","grantNumber":"R01DK126833,R01EB025841,RP180670"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100004917","fundingName":"Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas (CPRIT)"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Null Subtraction Beamforming for Improved Vessel Resolution in Volumetric Contrast-Enhanced Ultrasound","confLoc":"Xi'an, China","sourcePdf":"5390.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055736S","chronDate":"11-16 Sept. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9593294","isNumber":"9593298","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9593294","xplore-issue":"9593298","articleId":"9593368","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-18"},{"_id":9593377,"authors":[{"name":"Mohammad Wasih","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, Pennsylvania, USA"],"firstName":"Mohammad","lastName":"Wasih","id":"37089028161"},{"name":"Mohamed Almekkawy","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, Pennsylvania, USA"],"firstName":"Mohamed","lastName":"Almekkawy","id":"38469408100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-0355-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4777-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1948-5727"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"1948-5719"}],"articleNumber":"9593377","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":15},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optical filters","Training","Target tracking","Ultrasonic imaging","Correlation","Neural networks","Video sequences"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Motion Tracking","Correlation Filter Network","Siamese Network","Lucas Kanade","Optic flow"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9593377","abstract":"Siamese neural networks have been used previously for speckle tracking in ultrasound images.

We propose to improve the tracking algorithm by adopting Lucas Kanade method for finding optic flow to account for the background motion.

A Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling solver can be used, but at the expense of massive computation time.

If there is more than 5% fatty hepatorenal steatosis, it is deemed malignant. The traditional procedures for classifying hepatic steatosis mainly need the use of trained radiologists. Methods such as the Hepatorenal Index (HI) and Gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) are routinely employed. A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based strategy to classifying malignant and benign fatty livers from ultrasound images is presented in this research. The pre-trained Inception Resnet is utilized for transfer learning on B-mode ultrasound liver pictures for categorization. It was first trained on the ImageNet dataset. The softmax activation function is employed as an output layer of the fully connected network to calculate the class-wise probabilities, and the features recovered by the Inception Resnet are provided as input to the fully connected network. We used a 550-image open-source ultrasound liver dataset comprising 170 normal and 380 malignant samples.

With the development of the ultrafast ultrasound imaging based on the plane wave technique, the ultrasonic transit time-based method with straightforward principle is preferable for the detection of the local PWV of carotid artery. However, the filtering parameter settings in this method are difficult to be flexibly controlled, and the results of pulse wave transit time estimations are not stable. Aiming at these problems, an adaptive local PWV estimation based on the particle swarm optimization algorithm is proposed. First, An improved particle swarm optimization (PSO) with a fitness function evaluated in terms of the Savitzky-Golay (SG) filter length, SG polynomial degree, tracking position and tracking points parameters in regional upstroke tracking (RUT) approach is used to find the most optimum parameter settings for PWV estimation. To quantitatively evaluate the proposed adaptive local PWV estimation method (PSO_RUT), an ultrasound simulation model for three age groups is used. Results show that the mean PWV deviations from theoretical values estimated by the proposed PSO_RUT method are just within 3.8%, and lower than that estimated by RUT method. Therefore, the PSO_RUT approach proposed in this study can provide effective means for the improvement on the accuracy of ultrasound-based carotid PWV estimation.","doi":"10.1109/IUS52206.2021.9593564","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Ultrasonics Symposium (IUS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9593294/9593298/09593564.pdf","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Ultrasonics Symposium (IUS)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IUS52206.2021.9593564","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9593298","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Adaptive Estimation of Ultrasound Transit Time-based Local PWV in Carotid Artery using Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Adaptation models","Ultrasonic imaging","Ultrasonic variables measurement","Estimation","Filtering algorithms","Acoustics","Stability analysis"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["adaptive estimation","local PWV","particle swarm optimization","carotid artery"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9593564/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-16 Sept. 2021","displayDocTitle":"An Adaptive Estimation of Ultrasound Transit Time-based Local PWV in Carotid Artery using Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9593564/","publicationDate":"11 Sept. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"13 November 2021","conferenceDate":"11-16 Sept. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Adaptive Estimation of Ultrasound Transit Time-based Local PWV in Carotid Artery using Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm","confLoc":"Xi'an, China","sourcePdf":"4924.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.097075S","chronDate":"11-16 Sept. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9593294","isNumber":"9593298","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9593294","xplore-issue":"9593298","articleId":"9593564","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":9593574,"authors":[{"name":"Shaikhah Alkhadhr","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Pennsylvania State University, University Park, Pennsylvania, USA"],"firstName":"Shaikhah","lastName":"Alkhadhr","id":"37089029722"},{"name":"Xilun Liu","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Pennsylvania State University, University Park, Pennsylvania, USA"],"firstName":"Xilun","lastName":"Liu","id":"37088852038"},{"name":"Mohamed Almekkawy","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Pennsylvania State University, University Park, Pennsylvania, USA"],"firstName":"Mohamed","lastName":"Almekkawy","id":"38469408100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-0355-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4777-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1948-5727"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"1948-5719"}],"articleNumber":"9593574","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":32},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9593574","abstract":"Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) are used in modeling problems in nature and are commonly solved using classical methods like Finite Element Method (FEM), Finite Volume Method (FVM), or Finite Difference Method (FDM). However, solving high-dimensional PDEs has been notoriously difficult due to the Curse of Dimensionality (CoD). Among the pool of hyperbolic PDEs, the wave equation in particular is the base for modeling various clinical applications and designing many solutions in the medical fields of therapeutic and diagnostic ultrasound. This draws attention to the importance of accurate and efficient simulation. In recent years, deep neural networks have been proposed to predict numerical solutions of PDEs. Within that context, Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have surfaced as a powerful tool for modeling PDEs. We simulate a linear wave equation with a single time-dependent sinusoidal source function e.g.: sin (\u03c0 t) using PINNs to model one of the most fundamental modeling equations in medical ultrasound applications. Results achieved are validated by an FDM solution with the same problem setup. After training, the PINN prediction takes an average time 47% of the FDM time performed by MATLAB for the same simulation metrics (IC, BC, and domain range) on the same machine. Being a mesh-free approach, PINNs overcome the CoD which is one of the main challenges in traditional modeling methods.","doi":"10.1109/IUS52206.2021.9593574","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Ultrasonics Symposium (IUS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9593294/9593298/09593574.pdf","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Ultrasonics Symposium (IUS)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IUS52206.2021.9593574","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9593298","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modeling of the Forward Wave Propagation Using Physics-Informed Neural Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Ultrasonic imaging","Propagation","Neural networks","Mathematical models","Numerical models","Frequency division multiplexing"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Physics-Informed Neural Networks","Wave Equation","Forward Problem","Numerical Modelling"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9593574/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-16 Sept. 2021","displayDocTitle":"Modeling of the Forward Wave Propagation Using Physics-Informed Neural Networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9593574/","publicationDate":"11 Sept. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"13 November 2021","conferenceDate":"11-16 Sept. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modeling of the Forward Wave Propagation Using Physics-Informed Neural Networks","confLoc":"Xi'an, China","sourcePdf":"5341.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064172S","chronDate":"11-16 Sept. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9593294","isNumber":"9593298","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9593294","xplore-issue":"9593298","articleId":"9593574","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":9593582,"authors":[{"name":"Jingke Zhang","affiliation":["School of Medicine, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jingke","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37088594279"},{"name":"Lijie Huang","affiliation":["School of Medicine, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Lijie","lastName":"Huang","id":"37089027297"},{"name":"Hongen Liao","affiliation":["School of Medicine, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Hongen","lastName":"Liao","id":"37274929700"},{"name":"Jianwen Luo","affiliation":["School of Medicine, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jianwen","lastName":"Luo","id":"37085528690"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-0355-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4777-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1948-5727"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"1948-5719"}],"articleNumber":"9593582","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Location awareness","Ultrasonic imaging","Array signal processing","Microscopy","Spatial coherence","Robustness","Background noise"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Noise suppression","spatial coherence beamforming","ultrasound localization microscopy"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9593582","doi":"10.1109/IUS52206.2021.9593582","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Ultrasonics Symposium (IUS)","abstract":"Recently, the resolution of ultrasound imaging has been dramatically increased using ultrasound localization microscopy (ULM), by localizing the spatially isolated microbubbles (MBs).

These virtual sources are time-delayed and apodized so as to form a synthetic transmit aperture (STA) with dynamic focusing in retrospect. However, a separate time-delay algorithm and geometric model is needed for each case, and the virtual source model limits the granularity with which delays and apodizations can be applied. Multistatic STA has fine granularity due to the use of single element transmits, but suffers from poor electronic signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Retrospective encoding for conventional ultrasound sequences (REFoCUS) has recently been proposed as a technique to recover the multistatic dataset from ordinary ultrasound sequences with high SNR. REFoCUS treats all transmit sequences as multiplicative frequency-domain encodings that can be (pseudo-)inverted to recover multistatic data. Here, we demonstrate a prototype imaging system capable of real-time frame rates using GPU-based processing.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9593648/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-16 Sept. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"11 Sept. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"13 November 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9593648/","conferenceDate":"11-16 Sept. 2021","displayDocTitle":"Real-Time Universal Synthetic Transmit Aperture Beamforming with Retrospective Encoding for Conventional Ultrasound Sequences (REFoCUS)","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000070","fundingName":"National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering","grantNumber":"R01-EB013661"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Real-Time Universal Synthetic Transmit Aperture Beamforming with Retrospective Encoding for Conventional Ultrasound Sequences (REFoCUS)","confLoc":"Xi'an, China","sourcePdf":"5272.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042827S","chronDate":"11-16 Sept. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9593294","isNumber":"9593298","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9593294","xplore-issue":"9593298","articleId":"9593648","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-16"},{"_id":9593649,"authors":[{"name":"Siegfried Schlunk","affiliation":["Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN, USA"],"firstName":"Siegfried","lastName":"Schlunk","id":"37086227752"},{"name":"Brett Byram","affiliation":["Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN, USA"],"firstName":"Brett","lastName":"Byram","id":"37396852900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-0355-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4777-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1948-5727"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"1948-5719"}],"articleNumber":"9593649","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":10},"abstract":"Image quality and computational efficiency of the aperture domain model image reconstruction (ADMIRE) method is dependent on the specific model used.

This hybrid strategy leverages the spatial coherence among signals collected from regions far from the focal depth. As a result, it helps suppress artefacts from the sidelobes and clutter, which can enhance the contrast resolution on the generated image. The new beamformer is evaluated on both simulation and data from an experimental study.

As regularly in digital transmission, for such systems the bit-error probability is the crucial quality criterion - also known as the bit-error ratio (BER). If simple MIMO transmission channel and data source models are assumed, the BER can be computed analytically and the system under consideration can be optimized with the respect to a minimum BER. In this contribution, we consider BER minimization for MIMO links with uncertainty in their channel parameters under good and poor scattering conditions. Optimal solutions such as the Lagrange multiplier method regarding bit and power allocation in the transmitter are designed to achieve the best link performance. However, suboptimum solutions are able to achieve a similar performance with a significantly lower complexity. The obtained analytical results show that the achievable performance strongly depends on the number of active MIMO layers as well as the assigned transmit power per layer and the number of bits per transmitted symbol. Furthermore it turns out that the natural choice of creating MIMO layers with identical BER's does not guarantee the best performance.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 Sept. 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9593782/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9593782/","publicationDate":"20 Sept. 2021","conferenceDate":"20-23 Sept. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2021","displayDocTitle":"Resource Allocation in Correlated and Non-Correlated MIMO Systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Resource Allocation in Correlated and Non-Correlated MIMO Systems","confLoc":"LODZ, Poland","sourcePdf":"Klobe-100.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047718S","chronDate":"20-23 Sept. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9593295","isNumber":"9593296","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9593295","xplore-issue":"9593296","articleId":"9593782","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2020","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-26"},{"_id":9593837,"authors":[{"name":"Christopher Khan","affiliation":["Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN, USA"],"firstName":"Christopher","lastName":"Khan","id":"37087120640"},{"name":"Ruud J.G.

However, although effective, ADMIRE requires solving an inverse problem that is ill-posed, which means that there are infinitely many solutions that can have different impacts on image quality. Currently, linear regression with elastic-net regularization is used to obtain a solution, but there are potentially better methods for performing model fitting. Therefore, in this work, we propose using a deep neural network sparse encoder for performing the model fits of ADMIRE. In particular, we unfold the iterations of the iterative shrinkage and thresholding algorithm (ISTA) as a feedforward neural network and train it using different training schemes to perform sparse coding. Test results using both simulated and in vivo data demonstrate that ADMIRE using a deep neural network sparse encoder has the potential to outperform conventional ADMIRE in terms of ultrasound image quality while still preserving the model-based intuition of ADMIRE.","doi":"10.1109/IUS52206.2021.9593837","pdfPath":"/iel7/9593294/9593298/09593837.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Ultrasonics Symposium (IUS)","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Ultrasonics Symposium (IUS)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IUS52206.2021.9593837","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9593298","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performing Aperture Domain Model Image REconstruction (ADMIRE) Using a Deep Neural Network Sparse Encoder","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9593837/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-16 Sept. 2021","displayDocTitle":"Performing Aperture Domain Model Image REconstruction (ADMIRE) Using a Deep Neural Network Sparse Encoder","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2021","publicationDate":"11 Sept. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9593837/","conferenceDate":"11-16 Sept. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000002","fundingName":"NIH","grantNumber":"R01HL156034,R01EB020040,S10OD016216-01"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performing Aperture Domain Model Image REconstruction (ADMIRE) Using a Deep Neural Network Sparse Encoder","confLoc":"Xi'an, China","sourcePdf":"5363.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054018S","chronDate":"11-16 Sept. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9593294","isNumber":"9593298","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9593294","xplore-issue":"9593298","articleId":"9593837","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":9593901,"authors":[{"name":"Xin Huang","affiliation":["Embedded Computing and Signal Processing (ECASP) Research Laboratory, Chicago, IL, U.S.A."],"firstName":"Xin","lastName":"Huang","id":"37086487531"},{"name":"Jafar Saniie","affiliation":["Embedded Computing and Signal Processing (ECASP) Research Laboratory, Chicago, IL, U.S.A."],"firstName":"Jafar","lastName":"Saniie","id":"37300151000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-0355-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4777-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1948-5727"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"1948-5719"}],"articleNumber":"9593901","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":5},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9593901","abstract":"Ultrasonic communication through solid channels suffers from wave dispersion, attenuation, and multipath effect. It can be observed that the channel is frequency selective, and some frequencies will severely be attenuated as the distance between transmitter and receiver increases. Besides, when the pipes are used as the communication channels, the limited bandwidth and the adversarial reverberations are even worse. Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) has been widely used in modern wireless communication systems due to its robustness against frequency selectivity. The method can separate narrowband channels at different frequencies, which can reduce interference and crosstalk. In this study, we investigate the feasibility of using OFDM to realize intersymbol interference (ISI) mitigation through the steel pipe channel by using a reconfigurable FPGA-based SoC platform. Quadrature Phase Shift Keying (QPSK) modulation scheme and varied bitrates are selected to determine the feasible and reliable transmission rate.

In a carrier aggregation scheme, the solution can be extended to multifrequency scenario to design the block PA + M- plexer using co-design techniques.

This causes irresponsible people to use signatures as objects of forgery. In addition, handwritten signature identification is a challenge because it has less information when compared to digital signatures. This research proposes a new approach to identify handwritten signature forgeries using a convolutional neural network (CNN) using mobile-based. Two model architectures are compared with the same testing scenario. The first architecture is a simplification of the Siamese convolutional network namely adjusted CNN. The second architecture is a standard CNN with 6 convolution layers which in this study is called general CNN. CNN is used for both feature extraction and classification processes. The dataset is built with a limited number of individuals consisting of genuine and forged signatures. Based on the experiments, the accuracy of each network reached 88.89% for adjusted CNN and 84.45% for general CNN. Adjusted CNN then embedded in a mobile-based application to identify the signature directly. The application that is built makes the process of identifying signatures more ease.","doi":"10.1109/IES53407.2021.9594019","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IES53407.2021.9594019","startPage":"423","endPage":"429","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 International Electronics Symposium (IES)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9593288/9593289/09594019.pdf","publicationTitle":"2021 International Electronics Symposium (IES)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9593289","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Mobile Based Offline Handwritten Signature Forgery Identification using Convolutional Neural Network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"29-30 Sept. 2021","displayDocTitle":"Mobile Based Offline Handwritten Signature Forgery Identification using Convolutional Neural Network","conferenceDate":"29-30 Sept. 2021","publicationDate":"29 Sept. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"13 November 2021","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9594019/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9594019/","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100019716","fundingName":"Politeknik Elektronika Negeri Surabaya"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mobile Based Offline Handwritten Signature Forgery Identification using Convolutional Neural Network","confLoc":"Surabaya, Indonesia","sourcePdf":"071_1570750627_Luluil_423-429.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05193S","chronDate":"29-30 Sept. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9593288","isNumber":"9593289","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9593288","xplore-issue":"9593289","articleId":"9594019","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-26"},{"_id":9594021,"authors":[{"name":"Imamah","affiliation":["Faculty of Intelligent Electrical and Informatics Technology, Institut Teknologi Sepuluh Nopember, Surabaya, Indonesia"],"lastName":"Imamah","id":"37086817744"},{"name":"Umi Laili Yuhana","affiliation":["Faculty of Intelligent Electrical and Informatics Technology, Institut Teknologi Sepuluh Nopember, Surabaya, Indonesia"],"firstName":"Umi Laili","lastName":"Yuhana","id":"37085545503"},{"name":"Arif Djunaidy","affiliation":["Faculty of Intelligent Electrical and Informatics Technology, Institut Teknologi Sepuluh Nopember, Surabaya, Indonesia"],"firstName":"Arif","lastName":"Djunaidy","id":"38222793400"},{"name":"Mauridhi Hery Purnomo","affiliation":["Faculty of Intelligent Electrical and Informatics Technology, Institut Teknologi Sepuluh Nopember, Surabaya, Indonesia"],"firstName":"Mauridhi Hery","lastName":"Purnomo","id":"37294902900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4346-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4344-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4345-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4347-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9594021","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":17},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9594021","abstract":"Text classification is advantageous and necessary in a variety of fields.

Hyperparameter Optimization for Speech Emotion and Stress Recognition","abstract":"The most automated speech recognition (ASR) systems are extremely complicated, integrating many approaches and requiring a high variety of tuning parameters. Deep understanding and experience of each component are required to achieve optimal performance in ASR, confining the development of ASR systems to the experts. Hyperparameters are crucial for machine learning algorithms because they directly regulate the behavior of training algorithms and have a major impact on model performance. As a result, developing an effective hyperparameter optimization technique to optimize any given machine learning method would considerably increase machine learning efficiency. This work investigates the use of Random Forest and Bayesian to automatically optimize BiLSTM-CNN systems. We built the ASR based on the BiLSTM-CNN model and customized its hyperparameters value to heed our low-hardware specification during optimization. Furthermore, we gathered 1,000 clips of speech data from various movies, classifying them according to emotion and stress classes. In pursuit of contextual-level understanding in our ASR, we transcribed our speech data and used the bigram textual feature.

This potential is further increased by using industrial robots as manipulators. However, industrial robots are characterized by a low stiffness, which results - due to the acting process forces - in a low dimensional accuracy of the formed flanges. In this paper, the pose dependent stiffness of an industrial robot is modeled by data-driven regression models based on a gaussian process and artificial neural network. Both models are capable to predict the deformation error accurately. The gaussian process model shows a slightly higher generalizability compared to the artificial neural network and is hence used to predict the deformation error in single point incremental forming. An offline compensation method is proposed to generate an adjusted toolpath. Validation experiments with a heavy-duty industrial robot show the effectiveness of the proposed model. The dimensional error of the formed flange diameters could be reduced by about 50 %, resulting in more accurate and circular flanges.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9594061","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/ICAC50006.2021.9594138","publicationTitle":"2021 26th International Conference on Automation and Computing (ICAC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 26th International Conference on Automation and Computing (ICAC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9594055/9594061/09594138.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doi":"10.23919/ICAC50006.2021.9594138","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Deformation error compensation of industrial robots in single point incremental forming by means of data-driven stiffness model","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 Sept. 2021","displayDocTitle":"Deformation error compensation of industrial robots in single point incremental forming by means of data-driven stiffness model","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"2-4 Sept. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9594138/","publicationDate":"2 Sept. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9594138/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Deformation error compensation of industrial robots in single point incremental forming by means of data-driven stiffness model","confLoc":"Portsmouth, United Kingdom","sourcePdf":"p_50.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078348S","chronDate":"2-4 Sept. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9594055","isNumber":"9594061","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9594055","xplore-issue":"9594061","articleId":"9594138","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Chinese Automation and Computing Society in the UK - CACSUK","lastupdate":"2021-12-26"},{"_id":9594173,"authors":[{"name":"Zeyad Elsaraf","affiliation":["School of Computing and Engineering, University of Huddersfield, Huddersfield, United Kingdom"],"firstName":"Zeyad","lastName":"Elsaraf","id":"37088510393"},{"name":"Faheem A.

It has already received serious consideration for implementation in the fifth generation (5G) and beyond wireless communication systems. This is mainly due to NOMA allowing more than one user to utilise one transmission resource simultaneously at the transmitter side and successive interference cancellation (SIC) at the receiver side. However, in order to take advantage of the benefits NOMA provides in an optimal manner, power allocation needs to be considered to maximise the system throughput.This problem is non-deterministic polynomial-time (NP)-hard which is mainly why the use of deep learning techniques for power allocation is required. In this paper, a state-of-the-art review on cutting edge solutions to the power allocation optimisation problem using deep learning is provided. It is shown that the use of deep learning techniques to obtain effective solutions to the power allocation problem in NOMA is paramount for the future of NOMA based wireless communication systems. Furthermore, several possible research directions based on the the use of deep learning in NOMA systems are presented.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9594173/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 Sept. 2021","conferenceDate":"2-4 Sept. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2 Sept. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9594173/","displayDocTitle":"Deep Learning Based Power Allocation Schemes in NOMA Systems: A Review","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Deep Learning Based Power Allocation Schemes in NOMA Systems: A Review","confLoc":"Portsmouth, United Kingdom","sourcePdf":"p_134.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048024S","chronDate":"2-4 Sept. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9594055","isNumber":"9594061","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9594055","xplore-issue":"9594061","articleId":"9594173","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Chinese Automation and Computing Society in the UK - CACSUK","lastupdate":"2021-12-17"},{"_id":9594204,"authors":[{"name":"Gian Marti","affiliation":["ETH Zurich"],"firstName":"Gian","lastName":"Marti","id":"37086107451"},{"name":"Raphael Keusch","affiliation":["ETH Zurich"],"firstName":"Raphael","lastName":"Keusch","id":"37086233043"},{"name":"Hans-Andrea Loeliger","affiliation":["ETH Zurich"],"firstName":"Hans-Andrea","lastName":"Loeliger","id":"37269552300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-0943-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-0944-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9594204","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":10},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9594204","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Estimation","MIMO","Encoding","Bayes methods","MIMO communication"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9594058","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 11th International Symposium on Topics in Coding (ISTC)","publicationTitle":"2021 11th International Symposium on Topics in Coding (ISTC)","doi":"10.1109/ISTC49272.2021.9594204","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiuser MIMO Detection With Composite NUV Priors","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","pdfPath":"/iel7/9594056/9594058/09594204.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISTC49272.2021.9594204","abstract":"Normals with unknown variances (NUV) representations encompass variational representations of sparsifying norms and priors for sparse Bayesian learning.

However, when an electro-bicycle enters a crowded elevator, it will not only affect the service life of the elevator, but also it has great potential safety hazards when the battery charges at home. Thus, this study focuses on detecting various electro-bicycle intelligently in elevators in an online manner through improving the YOLO (You Only Look Once) v4 network. The YOLO v4 algorithm has high detection accuracy and speed due to its single stage mode and the priori frame mechanism. Thus, this study applies YOLO v4 as the fundamental network for electro-bicycle detections. The improved YOLO v4 algorithm, named as W_YOLO v4, reconstructs the YOLO v4 feature pyramid and the corresponding backbone feature extraction network. It also integrates the attention mechanism into the residual network of the backbone network to improve the detection accuracy. The experimental results show that the mAP (mean Average Precision) of W_YOLO v4 algorithm is 91.37 with 5000 data, which is 6.5 higher than the mAP of YOLO v4 algorithm, and the network parameters are reduced, such that the model is lighter than the YOLO v4 model.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 Sept. 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9594217/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9594217/","publicationDate":"2 Sept. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2021","conferenceDate":"2-4 Sept. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Detection Method of Electro-bicycle in Elevators Based on Improved YOLO v4","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Detection Method of Electro-bicycle in Elevators Based on Improved YOLO v4","confLoc":"Portsmouth, United Kingdom","sourcePdf":"p_28.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062214S","chronDate":"2-4 Sept. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9594055","isNumber":"9594061","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9594055","xplore-issue":"9594061","articleId":"9594217","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Chinese Automation and Computing Society in the UK - CACSUK","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":9594226,"authors":[{"name":"Fuhu Che","affiliation":["School of Computing and Engineering, University of Huddersfield, Huddersfield, UK"],"firstName":"Fuhu","lastName":"Che"},{"name":"Qasim Zeeshan Ahmed","affiliation":["School of Computing and Engineering, University of Huddersfield, Huddersfield, UK"],"firstName":"Qasim Zeeshan","lastName":"Ahmed"},{"name":"Faheem A.

Ultra-Wideband (UWB) is an emerging technology that can be employed for IPS as it offers centimetre-level accuracy. However, the UWB system still faces several technical challenges in practice, one of which is Non-Line-of-Sight (NLoS) signal propagation. Several machine learning approaches have been applied for the NLoS component identification. However, when the data contains a very small amount of NLoS components it becomes very difficult for existing algorithms to classify them. This paper focuses on employing an anomaly detection approach based on Gaussian Distribution (GD) and Generalized Gaussian Distribution (GGD) algorithms to detect and identify the NLoS components. The simulation results indicate that the proposed approach can provide a robust NLoS component identification which improves the NLoS signal classification accuracy which results in significant improvement in the UWB positioning system.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/ICAC50006.2021.9594226","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9594061","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 26th International Conference on Automation and Computing (ICAC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9594055/9594061/09594226.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Anomaly Detection Based on Generalized Gaussian Distribution approach for Ultra-Wideband (UWB) Indoor Positioning System","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9594226/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 Sept. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9594226/","displayDocTitle":"Anomaly Detection Based on Generalized Gaussian Distribution approach for Ultra-Wideband (UWB) Indoor Positioning System","conferenceDate":"2-4 Sept. 2021","publicationDate":"2 Sept. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Anomaly Detection Based on Generalized Gaussian Distribution approach for Ultra-Wideband (UWB) Indoor Positioning System","confLoc":"Portsmouth, United Kingdom","sourcePdf":"p_93.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07337S","chronDate":"2-4 Sept. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9594055","isNumber":"9594061","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9594055","xplore-issue":"9594061","articleId":"9594226","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Chinese Automation and Computing Society in the UK - CACSUK","lastupdate":"2021-11-18"},{"_id":9594269,"authors":[{"name":"Samiha Haque","affiliation":["Brac University, Dhaka, Bangladesh"],"firstName":"Samiha","lastName":"Haque","id":"37089034849"},{"name":"Nazibur Rahman","affiliation":["Brac University, Dhaka, Bangladesh"],"firstName":"Nazibur","lastName":"Rahman","id":"37089033776"},{"name":"Moin Mostakim","affiliation":["Brac University, Dhaka, Bangladesh"],"firstName":"Moin","lastName":"Mostakim","id":"38667535700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-86043-557-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4352-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9594269","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":3},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Measurement","Analytical models","Satellites","Computational modeling","Vegetation mapping","Crops"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Convolutional Neural Network","K-Means","Change Detection","Multispectral Image","ResNet-50","Sentinel-2"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9594269","abstract":"Several researches have been made in recent years which use Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to classify multispectral images. However, a scarcity of labelled satellite images makes it difficult to classify damaged forest areas using pre-trained CNNs. If any new destruction hits the forests, then there will be a lack of labelled satellite data and manually labeling the satellite images will be inefficient and will ultimately fail the purpose of rapid reforestation. Hence, this research aims to label the unlabelled Sentinel-2 satellite images by using a pre-trained ResNet-50 to obtain flattened feature maps from difference images of disaster struck vegetation areas followed by applying K-Means clustering algorithm on them. Thus, a complete labelled dataset is produced which is used to train two CNN models to classify the areas into undamaged and damaged classes for Model-1 and undamaged, mildly damaged and severely damaged classes for Model-2. Model-1 achieved 89.77% test accuracy and Model-2 achieved 85.69% test accuracy.

We investigate and compare neural networks\u2019 performance, including AAF, with other common methods such as Multivariate Adaptive Regression Spline (MARS) and lookup table interpolation for solving complex LAR prediction problems for deployment environments with limited hardware resources. We also introduce a novel loss function for training neural networks specific to the solution of the LAR problem. We demonstrate that using AAF in feed-forward neural networks as universal function approximators gives more accurate estimations with fewer model parameters. Experiment results show that our proposed method, using AAF in neural network layers, achieved lower Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Mean Squared Error (MSE) values, as well as higher Intersection over Union (IoU) scores against classical networks and other regression and lookup-table-based methods for a specific guidance mode. Our experiments also elaborate that adding extra trainable parameters in the activation function equations for each layer helped to extend its learning capability and generalization of the networks, and significantly reduced model parameter size for deployment amongst other algorithms. As a result, we observe that this solution is better suited for resource-constrained hardware environments for deployment of the developed models, and AAF theory successfully applies to regression-based LAR prediction task in addition to physics aware and physics informed neural networks.","doi":"10.1109/DASC52595.2021.9594334","startPage":"1","endPage":"10","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE/AIAA 40th Digital Avionics Systems Conference (DASC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9594100/9594288/09594334.pdf","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE/AIAA 40th Digital Avionics Systems Conference (DASC)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DASC52595.2021.9594334","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9594288","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Applying Novel Adaptive Activation Function Theory for Launch Acceptability Region Estimation with Neural Networks in Constrained Hardware Environments: Performance Comparison","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Adaptation models","Adaptive systems","Neural networks","Estimation","Machine learning","Hardware"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9594334/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-7 Oct. 2021","displayDocTitle":"Applying Novel Adaptive Activation Function Theory for Launch Acceptability Region Estimation with Neural Networks in Constrained Hardware Environments: Performance Comparison","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9594334/","publicationDate":"3 Oct. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2021","conferenceDate":"3-7 Oct. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Applying Novel Adaptive Activation Function Theory for Launch Acceptability Region Estimation with Neural Networks in Constrained Hardware Environments: Performance Comparison","confLoc":"San Antonio, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"3026.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073697S","chronDate":"3-7 Oct. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9594100","isNumber":"9594288","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9594100","xplore-issue":"9594288","articleId":"9594334","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-17"},{"_id":9594378,"authors":[{"name":"Chengtao Xu","affiliation":["Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University, FL, USA"],"firstName":"Chengtao","lastName":"Xu","id":"37088530821"},{"name":"Thomas Yang","affiliation":["Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University, FL, USA"],"firstName":"Thomas","lastName":"Yang","id":"37536271100"},{"name":"Houbing Song","affiliation":["Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University, FL, USA"],"firstName":"Houbing","lastName":"Song","id":"37085504009"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3420-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3421-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2155-7209"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2155-7195"}],"articleNumber":"9594378","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":34},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9594378","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Satellite broadcasting","Hardware","Blind source separation","Sensors","Delays","Space exploration","Cognitive radio"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["CubeSat Swarm","Non Terrestrial Network","Blind Signal Separation (BSS)","Improved Least Mean Square (LMS) Algorithm","CubeSat Hardware Design"]}],"abstract":"Low earth orbit CubeSat swarms improve the spatial and temporal resolution of remote sensing, rural communication, and space exploration due to their innovative and economical satellite design. Unlike conventional large satellites, which demand high transmission power for data exchange, the CubeSat swarm communication system provides interoperability, a high data rate between networked nodes, and global coverage with real-time measurement. However, CubeSat swarms\u2019 main challenges include inefficient usage of spectrum resources and delay of data exchange, and the issues become more severe with the increased number of on-orbit CubeSats. Spectrum sensing in cognitive radio is often proposed as a critical solution to efficient spectrum utilization and low delay of data exchange. Typically, the secondary user takes over the link while the primary user does not occupy the channel. This paper proposes blind source separation (BSS) and Least Mean Square (LMS) for primary user detection with MIMO antennas equipped in all CubeSats. Each antenna receives a mixture of radio signals, including primary and interfering signals. Practical implementation issues are studied through simulations, with main performance metrics including algorithm performance and MIMO antenna deployment.

Reducing the occurrence of these precursors may potentially improve flight safety. This may be achieved by increasing pilots exposure to them. This in turn can be realized by training pilots with flights that have multiple accident precursors. To that end, this work focuses on the development of simulated flights that could eventually be integrated within a simulation environment to help increase pilots\u2019 awareness about the precursors that lead to runway excursion events. Simulating flights with precursors require aircraft dynamic behavior to accurately model real world flying conditions. This requires model inputs to be mapped to the states based on real flight data. Real world flying conditions are represented by the flight operational quality assurance (FOQA) data. For this study, FOQA data is used to train long short term neural network model (LSTM) to simulate the aircraft behavior in final approach. Final approach is select as the flight phase of interest based on its significance to most frequent flight accidents such as runway excursion. A neural network model is used to simulate the final approach by sequentially predicting future aircraft states based on current aircraft states and full control trajectories. The accuracy of the aircraft model is evaluated based on the accuracy of predicted and actual state trajectories. Then the aircraft model is used to compare number of precursors triggered by simulated and actual flights. This comparison is used to evaluate the potential for simulated flights to be used for identifying accident precursors and increasing awareness to the precursors.","doi":"10.1109/DASC52595.2021.9594481","startPage":"1","endPage":"9","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE/AIAA 40th Digital Avionics Systems Conference

Sampling","abstract":"A typical scenario-based evaluation framework seeks to characterize a black-box system's safety performance (e.g., failure rate) through repeatedly sampling initialization configurations (scenario sampling) and executing a certain test policy for scenario propagation (scenario testing) with the black-box system involved as the test subject. In this letter, we first present a novel safety evaluation criterion that seeks to characterize the actual operational domain within which the test subject would remain safe indefinitely with high probability. By formulating the black-box testing scenario as a dynamic system, we show that the presented problem is equivalent to finding a certain almost robustly forward invariant set for the given system. Second, for an arbitrary scenario testing strategy, we propose a scenario sampling algorithm that is provably asymptotically optimal in obtaining the safe invariant set with arbitrarily high accuracy. Moreover, as one considers different testing strategies (e.g., biased sampling of safety-critical cases), we show that the proposed algorithm still converges to the unbiased approximation of the safety characterization outcome if the scenario testing satisfies a certain condition. Finally, the effectiveness of the presented scenario sampling algorithms and various theoretical properties are demonstrated in a case study of the safety evaluation of a control barrier function-based mobile robot collision avoidance system.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9594685/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2022","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 October 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9594685/","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2021","publicationDate":"Jan. 2022","accessionNumber":"21273639","volume":"7","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A Formal Characterization of Black-Box System Safety Performance With Scenario Sampling","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000140","fundingName":"U.S. Department of Transportation","grantNumber":"69A3552047138"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100015165","fundingName":"University Transportation Centers"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Formal Characterization of Black-Box System Safety Performance With Scenario Sampling","sourcePdf":"lra-weng-3122517-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.083501S","chronDate":"Jan.  2022","xplore-pub-id":"7083369","isNumber":"9568780","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7083369","xplore-issue":"9568780","articleId":"9594685","onlineDate":"29 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2022","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-10"},{"_id":9594697,"authors":[{"name":"Lin Wu","affiliation":["School of Automation, Key Laboratory of Measurement and Control of Complex System of Engineering, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Lin","lastName":"Wu"},{"name":"Teng Wang","affiliation":["School of Automation, Key Laboratory of Measurement and Control of Complex System of Engineering, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Teng","lastName":"Wang","orcid":"0000-0002-1802-0435"},{"name":"Changyin Sun","affiliation":["School of Automation, Key Laboratory of Measurement and Control of Complex System of Engineering, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Changyin","lastName":"Sun","orcid":"0000-0001-9269-334X"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1070-9908"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2361"}],"articleNumber":"9594697","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":69},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Semantics","Image segmentation","Feature extraction","Loss measurement","Visualization","Image recognition","Image coding"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Visual place recognition","multi-modal fusion","dynamics-invariant space","image translation","deep learning"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-Modal Visual Place Recognition in Dynamics-Invariant Perception Space","abstract":"Visual place recognition is one of the essential and challenging problems in the fields of robotics. In this letter, we for the first time explore the use of multi-modal fusion of semantic and visual modalities in dynamics-invariant space to improve place recognition in dynamic environments. We achieve this by first designing a novel deep learning architecture to generate the static semantic segmentation and recover the static image directly from the corresponding dynamic image. We then innovatively leverage the spatial-pyramid-matching model to encode the static semantic segmentation into feature vectors. In parallel, the static image is encoded using the popular Bag-of-words model. On the basis of the above multi-modal features, we finally measure the similarity between the query image and target landmark by the joint similarity of their semantic and visual codes.

Because of the unique nonvolatility and programmability, the memristor is an ideal nano-device to realize neural synapses in VLSI circuit implementation of neural networks. However, in the hardware implementation, the performance of the memristive neural network is always affected by quantization error, writing error, and conductance drift, which seriously hinders its applications in practice. In this paper, a novel weight optimization scheme combining quantization and Bayesian inference is proposed to alleviate this problem. Specifically, the weight deviation in the memristive neural network is transformed into the weight uncertainty in the Bayesian neural network, which can make the network insensitive to unexpected weight changes. A quantization regularization term is designed and utilized during the training process of the Bayesian neural network, reducing the quantization error and improving the robustness of the network. Furthermore, a partial training method is raised to extend the applicability of the proposed scheme in large-scale neural networks. Finally, the experiments on a Multilayer Perceptron and LeNet demonstrate that the proposed weight optimization scheme can significantly enhance the robustness of memristive neural networks.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9629436","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2021.3115787","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2021.3115787","startPage":"4851","endPage":"4861","pdfPath":"/iel7/8919/9629436/09594715.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9594715","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 October 2021","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9594715/","displayDocTitle":"QuantBayes: Weight Optimization for Memristive Neural Networks via Quantization-Aware Bayesian Inference","volume":"68","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"30 November 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9594715/","isJournal":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100012166","fundingName":"National Key Research and Development Program of China","grantNumber":"2018YFB1306600"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"U20A20227, 61976246, 62076207 and 62076208"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100005230","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Chongqing","grantNumber":"cstc2020jcyj-msxmX0385"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"QuantBayes: Weight Optimization for Memristive Neural Networks via Quantization-Aware Bayesian Inference","sourcePdf":"tcsi-duan-3115787-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.081008S","chronDate":"Dec.  2021","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"9629436","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","xplore-issue":"9629436","articleId":"9594715","onlineDate":"29 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-06"},{"_id":9594716,"authors":[{"name":"Peipei Jin","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information, Hangzhou Dianzi University, Hangzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/9610147/9594716/jin-3121676-small.gif","p":["Peipei Jin received the B.Eng. degree from the School of Electronic Information Engineering, Hebei University of Science and Technology, Hebei, China, in 2014, and the M.S. degree from the School of Electronic Information, Hangzhou Dianzi University, Hangzhou, China, in 2017, where she is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree.

A locally-active memristor, which possesses the capability to amplify infinitesimal fluctuations in energy and can be used to generate neuromorphic behaviors, is a natural candidate for constructing an electronic equivalent of biological neurons. This paper identifies some unknown neuromorphic dynamics of the Chua corsage memristor (CCM), and shows that the CCM, when biased at the edge of chaos domain, can exhibit rich dynamics of biological neurons. Using Chua\u2019s theories of local activity and edge of chaos, we demonstrate that under the destabilizing of the input voltage and the circuit parameters (inductance or capacitance), two CCM-based circuits can produce thirteen types of neuromorphic behaviors either on, or near the edge of chaos domain via supercritical or subcritical Hopf bifurcation. In addition, we give the conditions to test the edge of chaos of the CCM and the CCM-based circuit only by using the poles and the zero of their admittance functions.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.

For ET mode, to further improve efficiency of the ET-SM, the supply voltage of the LA can be modulated using an additional dc-dc converter according to the average output power. An adaptive quiescent current controller for the LA of the ET-SM is proposed to maintain its quiescent current for large variations in voltage and temperature. Due to the insensitive quiescent current over the voltage of the LA, the supply voltage to the LA can be controlled in a wider range for the average output power, which allows the power amplifier (PA) in the ET mode to have a greater improvement in efficiency. The size of the output stage of the LA is also discretely reconfigured using 3-bit digital control to reduce the power consumption of the LA according to the output power level. For the low average output power levels, the operation mode is changed to APT mode, which supplies a reduced dc voltage according to the reduced average output power to the PA. The proposed SM, dc/dc converter and PA ICs were designed and implemented using CMOS processes for 0.9 GHz LTE application. Using an LTE uplink signal with a signal bandwidth of 5 MHz and a PAPR of 7.5 dB, a PAE of 38.4% at an average output power of 24.0 dBm was obtained under an ACLR of \u221230.0 dBc for the overall ET-PA. At a 6 dB back-off for the average output power, a PAE of 24.6% was achieved using the ET mode. A maximum PAE improvement of 8.0% point using the proposed SM IC was achieved compared to the stand-alone PA.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9312710","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3124410","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/9312710/09594803.pdf","startPage":"147768","endPage":"147779","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3124410","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dual-Mode Supply Modulator IC With an Adaptive Quiescent Current Controller for Its Linear Amplifier in LTE Mobile Power Amplifier","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","displayDocTitle":"Dual-Mode Supply Modulator IC With an Adaptive Quiescent Current Controller for Its Linear Amplifier in LTE Mobile Power Amplifier","volume":"9","htmlLink":"/document/9594803/","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"2021","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9594803/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 November 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100004358","fundingName":"Samsung Electronics Company Ltd."},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003836","fundingName":"IC Design Education Center (IDEC), South Korea"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Dual-Mode Supply Modulator IC With an Adaptive Quiescent Current Controller for Its Linear Amplifier in LTE Mobile Power Amplifier","sourcePdf":"access-yang-3124410-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.114627S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"9312710","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","xplore-issue":"9312710","articleId":"9594803","onlineDate":"01 November 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-12-26"},{"_id":9594810,"authors":[{"name":"Wonjik Kim","affiliation":["School of Engineering, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Tokyo, Japan","Artificial Intelligence Research Center, National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology, Tokyo, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7361/9650682/9594810/kim-3124325-small.gif","p":["Wonjik Kim (Member, IEEE) received the B.E. and M.E. degrees from the Department of Systems and Control Engineering, Tokyo Institute of Technology, in 2018 and 2020, respectively, where he is pursuing the Ph.D. degree.

However, due to the architecture of a LiDAR sensor, LiDAR data typically contains much less information in the vertical direction compared to the horizontal direction. In addition, LiDAR data are often defected during measurement. There have been previous researches about LiDAR data interpolation using a high-resolution reference image. However, they suffer from the calibration error due to vibration or shock during operation and do not consider defected data. Here, we propose a reference-free interpolation method with considering the defected LiDAR data using a two-step network architecture. Our proposed method is designed first to exploit the rich information in the horizontal direction of the LiDAR data to restore the defected data and then increase the vertical resolution of LiDAR data. Since the proposed interpolation method is a reference-free approach, it if free from the calibration issue. We confirm that our proposed method shows better performance than existing interpolation methods and is effective as a pre-processing function in other applications. For example, our proposed method can improve the performance of the human segmentation. We also propose a pixelwise dynamic convolution layer as a component of the proposed interpolation method. The proposed dynamic convolution layer adaptively processes each pixel with variable kernels, while existing dynamic layers only use fixed kernels. Experimental results show that the proposed dynamic layer is more effective than existing dynamic layers for LiDAR data interpolation.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.15, 15 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9594810/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 November 2021","isJournal":true,"volume":"21","issue":"24","htmlLink":"/document/9594810/","publicationDate":"15 Dec.15, 2021","dateOfInsertion":"14 December 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Pixelwise Dynamic Convolution Neural Network for LiDAR Depth Data Interpolation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Pixelwise Dynamic Convolution Neural Network for LiDAR Depth Data Interpolation","sourcePdf":"jsen-kim-3124325-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.10352S","chronDate":"Dec.15, 15 2021","xplore-pub-id":"7361","isNumber":"9650682","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7361","xplore-issue":"9650682","articleId":"9594810","onlineDate":"01 November 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":9594819,"authors":[{"name":"Zeliang An","affiliation":["School of Communication and Information Engineering, Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Chongqing, China"],"firstName":"Zeliang","lastName":"An","orcid":"0000-0002-9947-9634"},{"name":"Tianqi Zhang","affiliation":["School of Communication and Information Engineering, Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Chongqing, China"],"firstName":"Tianqi","lastName":"Zhang"},{"name":"Baoze Ma","affiliation":["School of Communication and Information Engineering, Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Chongqing, China"],"firstName":"Baoze","lastName":"Ma"},{"name":"Chen Yi","affiliation":["School of Communication and Information Engineering, Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Chongqing, China"],"firstName":"Chen","lastName":"Yi","orcid":"0000-0002-2844-5787"},{"name":"Yuqing Xu","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Technology, Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Chongqing, China"],"firstName":"Yuqing","lastName":"Xu","orcid":"0000-0002-4246-0369"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"9594819","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":43},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Modulation","Feature extraction","Convolution","Quadrature amplitude modulation","Matrix decomposition","Constellation diagram","Image reconstruction"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Blind modulation recognition","OSTBC-OFDM system","zero-forcing blind equalization","projected constellation vector","temporal convolutional network"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9594819","abstract":"The blind modulation recognition (BMR) of high-order modulation types is a pressing task and needs to be raised in the calendar for the Beyond 5G (B5G) OSTBC-OFDM (Orthogonal Space-Time Block Coded-Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing) system.

Previous works proved that the decoding bandwidth had a tight lower bound related to the number of available participants. Some threshold schemes that achieved the lower bound (optimal decoding bandwidth) and optimal information rate were constructed for a given number (non-universal case) or multiple distinct number (\n<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\triangle $ </tex-math></inline-formula>\n-universal case) of available participants. However, all those CESS schemes have large share sizes. Moreover, they have a common feature that each secret and share are a vector with multiple coordinates, which results in the \n<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">decoding delay</i>\n since the combiner must reconstruct a part of coordinates of the secret at first, and these recovered coordinates will be used to reconstruct another part of coordinates of the secret. In this work, we describe a new construction for CESS schemes of non-universal and \n<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\triangle $ </tex-math></inline-formula>\n-universal cases, whereas each secret and share of our schemes are a \n<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">single</i>\n element of a finite field \n<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\mathbb {F}_{q^{e}}$ </tex-math></inline-formula>\n, and each participant of an authorized subset provides a \n<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">single</i>\n element of a same subfield of \n<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\mathbb {F}_{q^{e}}$ </tex-math></inline-formula>\n to the combiner to reconstruct the secret. We find that the CESS schemes of this type, termed balanced CESS schemes, have an inevitable restriction on the number of available participants, but our schemes has no decoding delay. Furthermore, our schemes have \n<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">smaller</i>\n share sizes than other existing works, which are realized by using a smaller sub-packetization \n<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$e$ </tex-math></inline-formula>\n and a smaller base field \n<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\mathbb {F}_{q}$ </tex-math></inline-formula>\n.

Nevertheless, there are still some limitations and challenges associated with their outcome, one of which is a lack of force feedback.

However, the correlation of various harmonics, which could improve the classification performance especially when evoked EEG components are much weaker than spontaneous EEG components, has not been take into consideration in the design of classifier in previous studies. In this study, we proposed a filter bank convolutional neural network (FBCNN) method to optimize SSVEP classification. Three filters with passbands covering each harmonic of SSVEP signals are used to extract and separate the corresponding components, and the information from them are transformed into frequency domain. Subsequently, we introduce a novel convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture with three parallel CNN channels to extract and learn the harmonic features in passbands, and conclusions on the correlation among harmonics can finally be made by pair-add-up operations and dimension reductions to weigh the feature vectors. The proposed FBCNN is evaluated on two public datasets (Dataset1: 12-class, 10 subjects; Dataset2: 40-class, 35 subjects) to compare with other methods. The experimental results illustrate that FBCNN method improves the performance of CNN-based SSVEP classification methods and has a great potential to be applied in SSVEP-based BCI.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3124238","startPage":"147129","endPage":"147141","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3124238","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9312710","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/9312710/09594841.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Filter Bank Convolutional Neural Network for SSVEP Classification","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9594841/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Filter Bank Convolutional Neural Network for SSVEP Classification","volume":"9","htmlLink":"/document/9594841/","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"2021","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 November 2021","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100005230","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Chongqing, China","grantNumber":"cstc2018jcyjAX0163"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61801069"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Filter Bank Convolutional Neural Network for SSVEP Classification","sourcePdf":"access-jiang-3124238-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.096126S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"9312710","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","xplore-issue":"9312710","articleId":"9594841","onlineDate":"01 November 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":9594911,"authors":[{"name":"Evlampios Apostolidis","affiliation":["Information Technologies Institute/Centre for Research and Technology Hellas, Thessaloniki, Greece","School of Electronic Engineering and Computer Science, Queen Mary University of London, London, U.K."],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5/9594910/9594911/apost-3117472-small.gif","p":["Evlampios Apostolidis received the Diploma degree in electrical and computer engineering from the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Thessaloniki, Greece, in 2007, and the M.Sc. degree in information systems from the University of Macedonia, Thessaloniki, in 2011.

After presenting the motivation behind the development of technologies for video summarization, we formulate the video summarization task and discuss the main characteristics of a typical deep-learning-based analysis pipeline. Then, we suggest a taxonomy of the existing algorithms and provide a systematic review of the relevant literature that shows the evolution of the deep-learning-based video summarization technologies and leads to suggestions for future developments. We then report on protocols for the objective evaluation of video summarization algorithms, and we compare the performance of several deep-learning-based approaches.

However, such applications may be susceptible to attacks by adversarial examples. In this paper, we develop a white-box adversarial attack mechanism to generate adversarial examples for data obtained from smart-meters installed in residential houses, and demonstrate that their statistical properties are indistinguishable from those of the true datapoints. The attack mechanism focuses specifically on Deep Learning based models used to perform appliance classification in smart home environments. The statistical indistinguishability of the adversarial datapoints from the true datapoints indicates that non Machine Learning based solutions may not be able to tackle the challenge posed by adversarial examples. The effectiveness of the proposed techniques is demonstrated using the publicly available United Kingdom-Domestic Appliance-Level Electricity smart-meter dataset.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9594946/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 14 2021-July 31 2021","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"14 June-31 July 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9594946/","dateOfInsertion":"13 November 2021","publicationDate":"14 June 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Adversarial Attack for Deep Learning Based IoT Appliance Classification Techniques","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adversarial Attack for Deep Learning Based IoT Appliance Classification Techniques","confLoc":"New Orleans, LA, USA","sourcePdf":"114_5075.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067149S","chronDate":"June 14 2021-July 31 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9594899","isNumber":"9594917","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9594899","xplore-issue":"9594917","articleId":"9594946","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-26"},{"_id":9595018,"authors":[{"name":"Rahul Kumar","affiliation":["The University of the South Pacific, Suva, Fiji"],"firstName":"Rahul","lastName":"Kumar","id":"37085430768"},{"name":"Shanal Kumar","affiliation":["The University of the South Pacific, Suva, Fiji"],"firstName":"Shanal","lastName":"Kumar","id":"37088911429"},{"name":"Giansalvo Cirrincione","affiliation":["University of Picardy Jules Verne, Amiens, France"],"firstName":"Giansalvo","lastName":"Cirrincione","id":"37278457400"},{"name":"Maurizio Cirrincione","affiliation":["The University of the South Pacific, Suva, Fiji"],"firstName":"Maurizio","lastName":"Cirrincione","id":"37278475800"},{"name":"Damien Guilbert","affiliation":["Universit\u00e9 de Lorraine, GREEN, Nancy, France"],"firstName":"Damien","lastName":"Guilbert","id":"37072604000"},{"name":"Krishnil Ram","affiliation":["The University of the South Pacific, Suva, Fiji"],"firstName":"Krishnil","lastName":"Ram","id":"37086489188"},{"name":"Ali Mohammadi","affiliation":["The University of the South Pacific, Suva, Fiji"],"firstName":"Ali","lastName":"Mohammadi","id":"37073007700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-5135-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-5134-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-6128-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2329-3748"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2329-3721"}],"articleNumber":"9595018","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":19},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Renewable energy sources","Buck converters","Neural networks","Hydrogen","Transportation","Switches"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["neural networks","fuel cell","Interleaved Buck Converter (IBC)","diagnostics","power switch open-circuit fault","Long Short Term Memory (LSTM)"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9595018","abstract":"Hydrogen energy conversion using Fuel Cells is very promising for standalone power as well as transportation applications.

To reduce the computational burden and enable the use of a simpler and more cost-effective microcontroller, two oversampling based control methods are proposed. This type of control exhibits unusual properties, such as unequal switching frequencies at individual ports and across the high frequency transformer.

However, since no or limited information about the internal control details, this matrix can only be obtained using the measured data.

It remains a fundamental aspect, if one plans to take action based on a prediction, or deploy a new ML model. Moreover, leaked and corrupted data during the training process can easily augment unexplainable actions from them. To address these issues, we first interpret the actions of the black box models by calculating a conditional entropy for each input with respect to an output. Using this metric, the averaged relationships between each input-output can be mapped and representative conclusions are firstly drawn on identifying erroneous data. Finally, these abnormal data are then removed from the training database to improve the interpretability & classification abilities of the ML model.

Moreover, many patients are in remote places and in many countries the patients to doctors ration is very poor which calls for a miniature hardware that remotely captures ECG and transmits data to the doctors. However, the exact reproduction of ECG requires high bit rate and thus requires transmitting a compressed set of parameters. Further, sending large volumes of annotated raw data to train diagnostic models also compromises the patients privacy. We design and present a system that generates synthetic ECG signals from clinical data in real-time using a highly minimized set of parameters. The system comprises a nonlinear dynamical model whose parameters are trained in real-time to synthesize a signal which matches clinical data with high accuracy. The parameters of the trained system are then transmitted in each cycle of the ECG wave to reconstruct the original signal using the same model at the medical practitioners\u2019 location. The parameter learning problem is highly complicated as one needs to solve a nonlinear, non-convex dynamic optimization problem, which usually only converges to local optima. To address this issue, we propose a novel two-stage algorithm that automatically chooses an initial set of parameters in the vicinity of the global optimum and then performs stochastic gradient descent iterations. We perform experiments to demonstrate the accuracy and real-time performance of the system. We show that on average our system processes clinical data of one second in 0.68s on a microcontroller, with an RMSE error of 0.0038 the average, and 17 parameters per ECG cycle. Our system is also easy to implement, requires minimal storage i.e. only one ECG cycle at any given time, and does not depend on offline training, unlike existing methods.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9595257/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 14 2021-July 31 2021","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"14 June-31 July 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9595257/","dateOfInsertion":"13 November 2021","publicationDate":"14 June 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Heart Watch: Dynamical Systems Based Real Time Data Driven ECG Synthesis","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Heart Watch: Dynamical Systems Based Real Time Data Driven ECG Synthesis","confLoc":"New Orleans, LA, USA","sourcePdf":"136_5264.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078888S","chronDate":"June 14 2021-July 31 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9594899","isNumber":"9594917","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9594899","xplore-issue":"9594917","articleId":"9595257","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-26"},{"_id":9595434,"authors":[{"name":"Rapha\u00ebl Joud","affiliation":["CEA Tech, Centre CMP, Equipe Commune CEA Tech - Mines Saint-Etienne, Gardanne, France","CEA, Leti, Univ.

DNN models reach impressive performances in several sensitive fields such as medical diagnosis, smart transport or security threat detection, and represent a valuable piece of Intellectual Property. Over the last few years, a major trend is the large-scale deployment of models in a wide variety of devices. However, this migration to embedded systems is slowed down because of the broad spectrum of attacks threatening the integrity, confidentiality and availability of embedded models. In this review, we cover the landscape of attacks targeting the confidentiality of embedded DNN models that may have a major impact on critical IoT systems, with a particular focus on model extraction and data leakage. We highlight the fact that Side-Channel Analysis (SCA) is a relatively unexplored bias by which model\u2019s confidentiality can be compromised. Input data, architecture or parameters of a model can be extracted from power or electromagnetic observations, testifying a real need from a security point of view.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 14 2021-July 31 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9595434/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9595434/","publicationDate":"14 June 2021","dateOfInsertion":"13 November 2021","conferenceDate":"14 June-31 July 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Review of Confidentiality Threats Against Embedded Neural Network Models","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Review of Confidentiality Threats Against Embedded Neural Network Models","confLoc":"New Orleans, LA, USA","sourcePdf":"106_5219.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062539S","chronDate":"June 14 2021-July 31 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9594899","isNumber":"9594917","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9594899","xplore-issue":"9594917","articleId":"9595434","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":9595468,"authors":[{"name":"Yuetao Hou","affiliation":["Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Yuetao","lastName":"Hou","id":"37088542388"},{"name":"Sreyam Sinha","affiliation":["Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Sreyam","lastName":"Sinha","id":"37085791069"},{"name":"Di Ni","affiliation":["Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Di","lastName":"Ni","id":"37086951660"},{"name":"Qing Ji","affiliation":["Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Qing","lastName":"Ji","id":"37304787600"},{"name":"Arun Persaud","affiliation":["Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Arun","lastName":"Persaud","id":"37314154500"},{"name":"Peter Seidl","affiliation":["Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Peter","lastName":"Seidl","id":"37268755400"},{"name":"Thomas Schenkel","affiliation":["Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Thomas","lastName":"Schenkel","id":"37320410900"},{"name":"Amit Lal","affiliation":["Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Amit","lastName":"Lal","id":"37276734200"},{"name":"Khurram K.

In this application, the PA generates a high voltage at a high frequency to accelerate ion beams to high energy levels. Since the PA is designed to provide large gain at a fixed frequency, slight variations in the PA\u2019s load capacitance \u2013 for example, due to manufacturing tolerances in the accelerating plate-pairs \u2013 can detune the PA and drastically reduce its output voltage. The proposed PA addresses this challenge by employing a multistage matching network with a variable capacitor. The value of the variable capacitor is appropriately adjusted to compensate for variation in load capacitance. Since this variable capacitor is connected at an intermediate stage of the matching network, it can be realized using devices with lower voltage rating, which is much lower than load voltage. Furthermore, the multistage matching network efficiently provides a large current step-up, improving the PA\u2019s thermal performance by reducing the current processed by its inverter transistors. A comprehensive methodology which maximizes PA\u2019s compensation range under certain loss constraints is also proposed. A 27.12-MHz prototype PA is designed, built and tested to validate the concept and design methodology.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9595468/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-14 Oct. 2021","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"10-14 Oct. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9595468/","dateOfInsertion":"16 November 2021","publicationDate":"10 Oct. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A 27.12-MHz kV-scale Power Amplifier with a Tunable Multistage Matching Network for a Compact Ion-beam Accelerator","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000015","fundingName":"U.S. Department of Energy"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 27.12-MHz kV-scale Power Amplifier with a Tunable Multistage Matching Network for a Compact Ion-beam Accelerator","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"853_21701.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050643S","chronDate":"10-14 Oct. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9594898","isNumber":"9594919","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9594898","xplore-issue":"9594919","articleId":"9595468","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-26"},{"_id":9595558,"authors":[{"name":"Qiushuo Chen","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Qiushuo","lastName":"Chen","id":"37086281033"},{"name":"Ying Fan","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Ying","lastName":"Fan","id":"37281246400"},{"name":"Yutong Lei","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Yutong","lastName":"Lei","id":"37089032245"},{"name":"Xu Wang","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Xu","lastName":"Wang","id":"37088662755"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-5135-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-5134-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-6128-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2329-3748"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2329-3721"}],"articleNumber":"9595558","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":21},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Torque","Sensitivity","Prototypes","Permanent magnet motors","Linear programming","Permanent magnets","Topology"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["CPUHPMVM","optimization algorithm","sensitivity analysis","Electromagnetic characteristics"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9595558","abstract":"To improve the output performance (torque, torque ripple, cogging torque) of the vernier motor, a consequent-pole unequal Halbach permanent magnet vernier motor (CPUHPMVM) has been proposed.

This problem is further compounded for dynamic inductive power transfer (DIPT) systems since DIPT requires more calculation points than IPT to know the average output power across the primary coil. This paper proposes a new design optimization method for DIPT systems utilizing a combination of FEM simulations and a neural network. A neural network trained by FEM results can generate a significantly larger number of design points than conventional methods in the same simulation time. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, designs using the proposed and conventional methods are compared. The results achieve 20% smaller core volume and 26% higher average output power for the proposed method over conventional one with the same simulation time and design criteria. Furthermore, to verify the accuracy of the proposed method, the final design generated by the proposed method is compared with FEM results.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-14 Oct. 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9595560/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9595560/","publicationDate":"10 Oct. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"16 November 2021","conferenceDate":"10-14 Oct. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A New Design Optimization Method for Dynamic Inductive Power Transfer Systems utilizing a Neural Network","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A New Design Optimization Method for Dynamic Inductive Power Transfer Systems utilizing a Neural Network","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"225_21768.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069974S","chronDate":"10-14 Oct. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9594898","isNumber":"9594919","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9594898","xplore-issue":"9594919","articleId":"9595560","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":9595576,"authors":[{"name":"Tushar Vrind","affiliation":["Samsung Semiconductor India R&D Center, Samsung Electronics, Bangalore, India"],"firstName":"Tushar","lastName":"Vrind","id":"38054618900"},{"name":"Sudharshan Rao","affiliation":["Samsung Semiconductor India R&D Center, Samsung Electronics, Bangalore, India"],"firstName":"Sudharshan","lastName":"Rao","id":"37088504904"},{"name":"Lalit Pathak","affiliation":["Samsung Semiconductor India R&D Center, Samsung Electronics, Bangalore, India"],"firstName":"Lalit","lastName":"Pathak","id":"37086352315"},{"name":"Debabrata Das","affiliation":["Network and Communication Research Lab, International Institute of Information Technology, Bangalore, India"],"firstName":"Debabrata","lastName":"Das","id":"37398132700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4431-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4432-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9595576","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":14},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9595576","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Deep learning","Analytical models","Trajectory planning","Simulation","Predictive models","Data models","Trajectory"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["non-terrestrial network","mMTC aerial communication","network sharing","deep learning","IoT"]}],"abstract":"Terrestrial cellular networks can benefit immensely for both coverage and capacity extension by deploying Low Altitude Platform (LAP)-based aerial cells. Reduction of the capital expenditure (CAPEX) and operation expenditure (OPEX) is a key consideration by telecom operators and sharing of aerial cells can be a great enabler. The available literature on aerial cell sharing amongst operators is limited to the use case of capacity enhancement in enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB), while use cases of massive machine type communication (mMTC) are not analyzed. To the best of our knowledge, for the first time, this paper proposes a novel mMTC-enhanced-Aerial Asset Manager (mMTC-enhanced-AAM) algorithm for trajectory planning and sharing of a LAP-based aerial cell by multiple operators in an mMTC network. mMTC-enhanced-AAM utilizes a deep learning model for data traffic forecasting and using the available hovering time constraint in LAP-based aerial cells, presents a predicted epoch-based time-sliced sharing plan amongst operators. The presented model and simulation results reveal much lower error (less than 10%) in mMTC data traffic forecasting. mMTC-enhanced-AAM minimizes the fleet size for LAPs and improves the utilization of the aerial cells, where the hover time utilization improves by 78%, and the number of LAPs requirement by operators reduces by 34% than the available literature.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9594917","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WF-IoT51360.2021.9595576","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 7th World Forum on Internet of Things (WF-IoT)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 7th World Forum on Internet of Things (WF-IoT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9594899/9594917/09595576.pdf","startPage":"165","endPage":"170","doi":"10.1109/WF-IoT51360.2021.9595576","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Deep Learning based Efficient Trajectory Planning and Sharing for Aerial Cells in mMTC Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 14 2021-July 31 2021","displayDocTitle":"Deep Learning based Efficient Trajectory Planning and Sharing for Aerial Cells in mMTC Networks","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"14 June-31 July 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9595576/","publicationDate":"14 June 2021","dateOfInsertion":"13 November 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9595576/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Deep Learning based Efficient Trajectory Planning and Sharing for Aerial Cells in mMTC Networks","confLoc":"New Orleans, LA, USA","sourcePdf":"030_5059.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.104645S","chronDate":"June 14 2021-July 31 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9594899","isNumber":"9594917","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9594899","xplore-issue":"9594917","articleId":"9595576","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-26"},{"_id":9595599,"authors":[{"name":"Asad Ali Khan","affiliation":["The University of Texas at San Antonio, San Antonio, United States"],"firstName":"Asad Ali","lastName":"Khan","id":"37088509156"},{"name":"Sara Ahmed","affiliation":["The University of Texas at San Antonio, San Antonio, United States"],"firstName":"Sara","lastName":"Ahmed","id":"37400905300"},{"name":"Omar A.

This is because the inductance of the stator across the air gap is not equal and vice versa in the surface-mounted PMSM. Thus, the field-oriented control (FOC) strategies of surface-mounted type is greatly desirable to the IPMSM. In this paper, some contributions of the FOC strategy are proposed. The primary objective is to achieve a high dynamic performance of the IPMSM in the region of flux-weakening under sudden torque turbulence and velocity fluctuation. The concentration of the proposed strategy is on the cost function of the parameter optimization, which is optimized based on a genetic algorithm to obtain parameters that will contribute to further driving stability in this region. Meanwhile, the improvement includes adjusting the saturation limits for the outer control loops to cancel the wave overshoots. Finally, the results of simulation and experimentation have fully verified the proposed approach. When compared to the classical strategy, the proposed algorithms can help decrease the settling time and the overshoot in both velocity and current.","doi":"10.1109/ECCE47101.2021.9595729","startPage":"4927","endPage":"4932","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition (ECCE)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ECCE47101.2021.9595729","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9594919","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition (ECCE)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9594898/9594919/09595729.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improved Controller Optimization of Flux-Weakening Strategy for Salient Permanent-Magnet Synchronous Motor Based on Genetic Algorithm","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9595729/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Improved Controller Optimization of Flux-Weakening Strategy for Salient Permanent-Magnet Synchronous Motor Based on Genetic Algorithm","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9595729/","publicationDate":"10 Oct. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"16 November 2021","conferenceDate":"10-14 Oct. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-14 Oct. 2021","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100012166","fundingName":"National Key Research and Development Program of China"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improved Controller Optimization of Flux-Weakening Strategy for Salient Permanent-Magnet Synchronous Motor Based on Genetic Algorithm","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"729_21408.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062953S","chronDate":"10-14 Oct. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9594898","isNumber":"9594919","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9594898","xplore-issue":"9594919","articleId":"9595729","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":9595800,"authors":[{"name":"Hela Chamkhia","affiliation":["Computer Science and Engineering, Qatar University, Qatar"],"firstName":"Hela","lastName":"Chamkhia"},{"name":"Abdullah Al-Ali","affiliation":["Computer Science and Engineering, Qatar University, Qatar"],"firstName":"Abdullah","lastName":"Al-Ali"},{"name":"Amr Mohamed","affiliation":["Computer Science and Engineering, Qatar University, Qatar"],"firstName":"Amr","lastName":"Mohamed"},{"name":"Mohsen Guizani","affiliation":["Computer Science and Engineering, Qatar University, Qatar"],"firstName":"Mohsen","lastName":"Guizani"},{"name":"Aiman Erbad","affiliation":["College of Science and Engineering, Hamad Bin Khalifa University, Doha, Qatar"],"firstName":"Aiman","lastName":"Erbad"},{"name":"Ahmed Refaey","affiliation":["College of Science and Engineering, Western University, London, ON, Canada","Manhattan College, Riverdale, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Ahmed","lastName":"Refaey"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4431-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4432-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9595800","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Measurement","Geometry","NOMA","Quantization (signal)","Stochastic processes","Tools","Entropy"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Internet of Things","Channel-based Key Generation","Lightweight Communication","NOMA","Physical layer Security."]}],"abstract":"In Internet of Things (IoT), a massive amount of sensitive data is generated and transmitted by IoT devices.

There are many design parameters of the DSBHEM, which lead to the contradiction of speed range, torque output and torque ripple. Therefore, a framework of multi-objective optimization method (MOOM) is proposed to improve the overall performance of the DSBHEM. Firstly, the sensitivity of the design variables is analyzed, and the critical variables are extracted, and the response surface model (RSM) is constructed.

We train a binarized neural network classifier on the UNSW-NB15 data set and achieve an 82.1% accuracy. We implement the binarized neural network in hardware using a generator written in Chisel and integrate it on a Zynq-7000 system-on-a-chip.

To implement this technique on PV modules \u2013 which have a wider impedance bandwidth, the following needs to be considered. Both converter and PV module are non-linear, and since a varying frequency module excitation signal is induced through a bandwidth limited non-linear converter, this presents linearity issues. This study demonstrates the use of a parametric APRBS excitation signal, designed by defining the signal design points as a series of ramp functions This parametric profile mitigates the frequency induced system non-linearities, while producing fast and accurate online impedance estimation across a wide bandwidth. The results show that the APRBS achieves good tolerance for the induced system non-linearities \u2013 this is demonstrated by a small impedance error between the designed system and a Frequency Response Analyzer (FRA) for all frequencies within the bandwidth of the module.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Condition monitoring","Photovoltaic systems","Spectroscopy","Linearity","Bandwidth","Frequency estimation","System identification"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["APRBS","BIS","Converter","PV"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ECCE47101.2021.9595969","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition (ECCE)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition (ECCE)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9594898/9594919/09595969.pdf","startPage":"443","endPage":"450","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9594919","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ECCE47101.2021.9595969","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An amplitude-modulated pseudo-random binary sequence approach to broadband impedance spectroscopy for photovoltaic module system identification","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9595969","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"An amplitude-modulated pseudo-random binary sequence approach to broadband impedance spectroscopy for photovoltaic module system identification","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9595969/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"10 Oct. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9595969/","conferenceDate":"10-14 Oct. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"16 November 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-14 Oct. 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An amplitude-modulated pseudo-random binary sequence approach to broadband impedance spectroscopy for photovoltaic module system identification","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"066_21139.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04093S","chronDate":"10-14 Oct. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9594898","isNumber":"9594919","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9594898","xplore-issue":"9594919","articleId":"9595969","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-26"},{"_id":9596003,"authors":[{"name":"Dongsen Sun","affiliation":["Temple University, Philadelphia, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Dongsen","lastName":"Sun","id":"37595898800"},{"name":"Shengyi Wang","affiliation":["Temple University, Philadelphia, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Shengyi","lastName":"Wang","id":"37086446332"},{"name":"Liang Du","affiliation":["Temple University, Philadelphia, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Liang","lastName":"Du","id":"37086447696"},{"name":"Xiaonan Lu","affiliation":["Temple University, Philadelphia, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Xiaonan","lastName":"Lu","id":"37405860600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-5135-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-5134-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-6128-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2329-3748"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2329-3721"}],"articleNumber":"9596003","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":14},"abstract":"This paper proposes a harmonic compensation control (HCC) scheme for grid-interactive inverters to ensure high-quality grid current injection under distorted grid voltage conditions. Firstly, a generic harmonic state-space (HSS) model of grid-tied inverters is derived to incorporate the harmonic features. Secondly, a data-driven harmonic calculation module (D-HCM) is designed and trained to estimate the harmonic spectrum of inverter voltage in HSS, which enables the closed-loop control of grid-tied inverters. Based on the obtained HSS model as well as the D-HCM, the HCC scheme is presented in details and the corresponding harmonic regulators are further developed. Finally, simulations are carried out in Matlab to verify the proposed D-HCM as well as the HCC scheme of grid-tied inverters. Specifically, numerical validation results verify that the trained D-HCM can achieve accurate harmonics estimation with very small mean squared error (MSE) and very high R value. Moreover, simulation results of the overall closed-loop controlled system including HSS modeling, D-HCM, and HCC verify that grid-tied inverters could present better harmonics disturbance rejection performance with the proposed HCC scheme under distorted grid voltage conditions.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Regulators","Simulation","Estimation","Harmonic analysis","Inverters","Mathematical models","Numerical models"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Grid-tied inverters","background grid harmonics","harmonic state space","harmonic compensation control"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ECCE47101.2021.9596003","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition (ECCE)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition (ECCE)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9594898/9594919/09596003.pdf","startPage":"3134","endPage":"3139","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9594919","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ECCE47101.2021.9596003","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Harmonic Compensation Control of Grid Interactive Inverters Based on Data-driven Harmonic State Space Modeling","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9596003","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Harmonic Compensation Control of Grid Interactive Inverters Based on Data-driven Harmonic State Space Modeling","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9596003/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"10 Oct. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9596003/","conferenceDate":"10-14 Oct. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"16 November 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-14 Oct. 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Harmonic Compensation Control of Grid Interactive Inverters Based on Data-driven Harmonic State Space Modeling","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"469_21915.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.117978S","chronDate":"10-14 Oct. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9594898","isNumber":"9594919","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9594898","xplore-issue":"9594919","articleId":"9596003","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-26"},{"_id":9596033,"authors":[{"name":"Sylvia Worlali Azumah","affiliation":["School of Information Technology, University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, Ohio, United States"],"firstName":"Sylvia Worlali","lastName":"Azumah","id":"37088965938"},{"name":"Nelly Elsayed","affiliation":["School of Information Technology, University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, Ohio, United States"],"firstName":"Nelly","lastName":"Elsayed","id":"37086197316"},{"name":"Victor Adewopo","affiliation":["School of Information Technology, University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, Ohio, United States"],"firstName":"Victor","lastName":"Adewopo","id":"37088375263"},{"name":"Zaghloul Saad Zaghloul","affiliation":["School of Information Technology, University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, Ohio, United States"],"firstName":"Zaghloul Saad","lastName":"Zaghloul","id":"37088844678"},{"name":"Chengcheng Li","affiliation":["School of Information Technology, University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, Ohio, United States"],"firstName":"Chengcheng","lastName":"Li","id":"37088844178"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4431-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4432-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9596033","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":18},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9596033","abstract":"The technological advancement of the Internet of Things (IoT) devices in our world today has become beneficial to many users but has security issues that are left unattended.

If we early predict such misfortunes through the variety of big data collected for such distinct positions at a particular amount of time then certainly can save the life and goods from such big natural calamities. Such normalized data can be updated at a regular interval of time. In view of this, the time series data analysis provides a method to early aware and protects the life of people from such natural disasters.

In this technique, two types of predictions are used which are based on fifteen and twenty days. The comparison results reveal those fifteen days prediction provides more effective classification accuracy than twenty days prediction.","doi":"10.1109/ICRITO51393.2021.9596073","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 9th International Conference on Reliability, Infocom Technologies and Optimization (Trends and Future Directions) (ICRITO)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9596064/9596065/09596073.pdf","publicationTitle":"2021 9th International Conference on Reliability, Infocom Technologies and Optimization (Trends and Future Directions) (ICRITO)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICRITO51393.2021.9596073","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9596065","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Forecasting of Precipitation in India by Different Data Types using Investigation of Radial Basis Function Neural Network Model","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Analytical models","Data analysis","Time series analysis","Neurons","Radial basis function networks","Predictive models","Prediction algorithms"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Feed Forward Neural Network Model","time series data analysis","back propagation algorithm","Natural disaster"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9596073/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-4 Sept. 2021","displayDocTitle":"Forecasting of Precipitation in India by Different Data Types using Investigation of Radial Basis Function Neural Network Model","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9596073/","publicationDate":"3 Sept. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2021","conferenceDate":"3-4 Sept. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Forecasting of Precipitation in India by Different Data Types using Investigation of Radial Basis Function Neural Network Model","confLoc":"Noida, India","sourcePdf":"ICRITO2021Paper0792.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065404S","chronDate":"3-4 Sept. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9596064","isNumber":"9596065","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9596064","xplore-issue":"9596065","articleId":"9596073","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":9596133,"authors":[{"name":"Vinay Kukreja","affiliation":["Chitkara University Institute of Engineering and Technology, Chitkara University, Punjab, India"],"firstName":"Vinay","lastName":"Kukreja","id":"37088493773"},{"name":"Deepak Kumar","affiliation":["Chitkara University Institute of Engineering and Technology, Chitkara University, Punjab, India"],"firstName":"Deepak","lastName":"Kumar","id":"37088598397"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-1703-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-6654-1702-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-1704-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9596133","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9596133","abstract":"Wheat is the staple food for Indians and it is one of the most common grain crops all over the world. The wheat diseases cause a huge amount of yield losses. The wheat yield losses are due to fungi, bacterial and insect-based diseases. Due to fungal diseases, yield loss has a great effect on wheat grain. Based on the type of fungus, the fungal diseases are categorized into four types namely as rust, leaf spot, spike infection, and virus-based diseases. Hence, these rust diseases affect the whole wheat plant and lead to very heavy yield quality loss. To overcome these quality yield issues, a deep learning-based approach known as a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) is proposed which can easily classify the wheat rust diseases automatically without human investigation. Additionally, this DCNN training and testing process produces wheat rust diseases determination and high classification results. A total of 1486 wheat plant images have been accessed through the CGIAR dataset and 514 wheat stem rust images have been collected from secondary sources. A total of 2000 wheat plant images have been used for training and testing purposes in DCNN. During training, a stochastic gradient descent method achieves high classification results. Therefore, our proposed approach achieves high classification accuracy of 97.16% for wheat rust diseases.","doi":"10.1109/ICRITO51393.2021.9596133","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 9th International Conference on Reliability, Infocom Technologies and Optimization (Trends and Future Directions) (ICRITO)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9596064/9596065/09596133.pdf","publicationTitle":"2021 9th International Conference on Reliability, Infocom Technologies and Optimization (Trends and Future Directions) (ICRITO)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICRITO51393.2021.9596133","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9596065","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Automatic Classification of Wheat Rust Diseases Using Deep Convolutional Neural Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Fungi","Neural networks","Market research","Convolutional neural networks","Reliability","Viruses (medical)"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Neural networks","Wheat diseases","Deep learning","Machine learning","Convolutional neural networks"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9596133/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-4 Sept. 2021","displayDocTitle":"Automatic Classification of Wheat Rust Diseases Using Deep Convolutional Neural Networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9596133/","publicationDate":"3 Sept. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2021","conferenceDate":"3-4 Sept. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automatic Classification of Wheat Rust Diseases Using Deep Convolutional Neural Networks","confLoc":"Noida, India","sourcePdf":"ICRITO2021Paper1119.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050495S","chronDate":"3-4 Sept. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9596064","isNumber":"9596065","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9596064","xplore-issue":"9596065","articleId":"9596133","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-17"},{"_id":9596307,"authors":[{"name":"Friedrich D\u00f6rmann","affiliation":["Aarhus University",""],"firstName":"Friedrich","lastName":"D\u00f6rmann","id":"37088844655"},{"name":"Osvald Frisk","affiliation":["Aarhus University",""],"firstName":"Osvald","lastName":"Frisk","id":"37088842937"},{"name":"Lars N\u00f8rvang Andersen","affiliation":["Aarhus University",""],"firstName":"Lars N\u00f8rvang","lastName":"Andersen","id":"37089032920"},{"name":"Christian Fischer Pedersen","affiliation":["Aarhus University",""],"firstName":"Christian Fischer","lastName":"Pedersen","id":"37085447388"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-6338-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-1184-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"1551-2541"}],"articleNumber":"9596307","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":21},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Privacy","Differential privacy","Machine learning algorithms","Gaussian noise","Conferences","Neural networks"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Deep Learning","Privacy","Differential Privacy","Stochastic Gradient Descent","Gradient Noise"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9596307","abstract":"Learning often involves sensitive data and as such, privacy preserving extensions to Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and other machine learning algorithms have been developed using the definitions of Differential Privacy (DP). In differentially private SGD, the gradients computed at each training iteration are subject to two different types of noise. Firstly, inherent sampling noise arising from the use of minibatches. Secondly, additive Gaussian noise from the underlying mechanisms that introduce privacy. In this study, we show that these two types of noise are equivalent in their effect on the utility of private neural networks, however they are not accounted for equally in the privacy budget. Given this observation, we propose a training paradigm that shifts the proportions of noise towards less inherent and more additive noise, such that more of the overall noise can be accounted for in the privacy budget. With this paradigm, we are able to improve on the state-of-the-art in the privacy/utility tradeoff of private end-to-end CNNs.","doi":"10.1109/MLSP52302.2021.9596307","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MLSP52302.2021.9596307","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 31st International Workshop on Machine Learning for Signal Processing (MLSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9596063/9596068/09596307.pdf","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 31st International Workshop on Machine Learning for Signal Processing (MLSP)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9596068","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Not All Noise is Accounted Equally: How Differentially Private Learning Benefits from Large Sampling Rates","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 Oct. 2021","displayDocTitle":"Not All Noise is Accounted Equally: How Differentially Private Learning Benefits from Large Sampling Rates","conferenceDate":"25-28 Oct. 2021","publicationDate":"25 Oct. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2021","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9596307/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9596307/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Not All Noise is Accounted Equally: How Differentially Private Learning Benefits from Large Sampling Rates","confLoc":"Gold Coast, Australia","sourcePdf":"90.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050437S","chronDate":"25-28 Oct. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9596063","isNumber":"9596068","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9596063","xplore-issue":"9596068","articleId":"9596307","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-26"},{"_id":9596357,"authors":[{"name":"Poonam Dhiman","affiliation":["Government PG College, Ambala Cantt, India"],"firstName":"Poonam","lastName":"Dhiman","id":"37085513451"},{"name":"Vinay Kukreja","affiliation":["Chitkara University Institute of Engineering and Technology, Chitkara University, Punjab, India"],"firstName":"Vinay","lastName":"Kukreja","id":"37088493773"},{"name":"Amandeep Kaur","affiliation":["Chitkara University Institute of Engineering and Technology, Chitkara University, Punjab, India"],"firstName":"Amandeep","lastName":"Kaur","id":"37073054600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-1703-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-6654-1702-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-1704-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9596357","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":4},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Deep learning","Uncertainty","Computational modeling","Plants (biology)","Machine vision","Market research","Convolutional neural networks"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Deep learning","Citrus diseases","Normalization","CNN","Pre-processing"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9596357","abstract":"Plant diseases are one of the causes of financial deficits in the agriculture farming industry around the world. It is the most important factor since it reduces both the potential and the quality of the growing crops. Fruits are one of the most important sources of nutrients in plants; although, there's a diverse range of diseases that affect the quality and development of fruits. Machine vision approaches have been developed to deal with these challenges these approaches are very useful in that they not only identify diseases/infections early but also tag them. In this paper, a deep CNN-based approach for disease classification of citrus fruits into healthy and infected classes is proposed. To improve the quality of image samples, the dataset is pre-processed with normalization. CNN model is implemented on the citrus fruits dataset with different sizes of input layers such as 64\u00d764,100\u00d7100and 256\u00d7256.it is observed that the model having the size of 64\u00d764 and 256\u00d725 produces the same accuracy but the size of the model with 64\u00d764 is significantly reduced by the factor of 37.65% on our collected dataset. The maximum accuracy of 96% is obtained with a model of input layer size of 100\u00d7100 with the 38 MB size.","doi":"10.1109/ICRITO51393.2021.9596357","pdfPath":"/iel7/9596064/9596065/09596357.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 9th International Conference on Reliability, Infocom Technologies and Optimization (Trends and Future Directions) (ICRITO)","publicationTitle":"2021 9th International Conference on Reliability, Infocom Technologies and Optimization (Trends and Future Directions) (ICRITO)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICRITO51393.2021.9596357","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9596065","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Citrus Fruits Classification and Evaluation using Deep Convolution Neural Networks: An Input Layer Resizing Approach","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9596357/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-4 Sept. 2021","displayDocTitle":"Citrus Fruits Classification and Evaluation using Deep Convolution Neural Networks: An Input Layer Resizing Approach","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2021","publicationDate":"3 Sept. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9596357/","conferenceDate":"3-4 Sept. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Citrus Fruits Classification and Evaluation using Deep Convolution Neural Networks: An Input Layer Resizing Approach","confLoc":"Noida, India","sourcePdf":"ICRITO2021Paper0235.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046441S","chronDate":"3-4 Sept. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9596064","isNumber":"9596065","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9596064","xplore-issue":"9596065","articleId":"9596357","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":9596448,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaoxue Zhao","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, Shenyang Aerospace University, Shenyang, China"],"firstName":"Xiaoxue","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37088875428"},{"name":"Cuiwei Liu","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, Shenyang Aerospace University, Shenyang, China"],"firstName":"Cuiwei","lastName":"Liu","id":"37086615436"},{"name":"Xiangbin Shi","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, Shenyang Aerospace University, Shenyang, China"],"firstName":"Xiangbin","lastName":"Shi","id":"37853665700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-6338-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-1184-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"1551-2541"}],"articleNumber":"9596448","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":21},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Convolution","Fuses","Conferences","Merging","Machine learning","Predictive models","Feature extraction"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["action recognition","skeleton","GCN","multi-stream","early fusion"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9596448","abstract":"Skeleton-based action recognition has attracted much attention in computer vision.

In this paper, we propose a novel Early Fusion Graph Convolutional Network (EF-GCN), which fuses hidden features extracted from multiple skeleton data streams at different levels to enhance the discriminative power of features. Unlike the previous GCN-based models that train networks corresponding to different streams independently, all the subnetworks in the proposed EF-GCN are jointly learned in an end-to-end manner. Experiments conducted on two skeleton datasets (i.e., NTU-RGB+D and NTU-120 RGB+D) show the superior performance of EF-GCN.","doi":"10.1109/MLSP52302.2021.9596448","pdfPath":"/iel7/9596063/9596068/09596448.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 31st International Workshop on Machine Learning for Signal Processing (MLSP)","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 31st International Workshop on Machine Learning for Signal Processing (MLSP)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MLSP52302.2021.9596448","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9596068","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Early Fusion Graph Convolutional Network for Skeleton-Based Action Recognition","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9596448/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 Oct. 2021","displayDocTitle":"Early Fusion Graph Convolutional Network for Skeleton-Based Action Recognition","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2021","publicationDate":"25 Oct. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9596448/","conferenceDate":"25-28 Oct. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of China(NSFC)","grantNumber":"61602320"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Early Fusion Graph Convolutional Network for Skeleton-Based Action Recognition","confLoc":"Gold Coast, Australia","sourcePdf":"186.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054624S","chronDate":"25-28 Oct. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9596063","isNumber":"9596068","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9596063","xplore-issue":"9596068","articleId":"9596448","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":9596461,"authors":[{"name":"Manivarsh Adi","affiliation":["Lovely Professional University, Phagwara, Punjab, India"],"firstName":"Manivarsh","lastName":"Adi","id":"37088881534"},{"name":"Ruthvik Reddy Karakala","affiliation":["St Martins Engineering College, Secunderabad, Telangana, India"],"firstName":"Ruthvik Reddy","lastName":"Karakala","id":"37089034834"},{"name":"Pooja Rana","affiliation":["Lovely Professional University, Phagwara, Punjab, India"],"firstName":"Pooja","lastName":"Rana","id":"37088504211"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-1703-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-6654-1702-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-1704-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9596461","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":12},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9596461","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["TV","Merging","Neural networks","Linear regression","Machine learning","Market research","Reliability"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Simple Linear Regression","Perceptron","Neural Network and Random Sampling"]}],"abstract":"In recent years hybrid systems have gained more popularity in soft computing and machine learning applications.

NN has numerous real life applications in almost every field like medicines, biometrics, automation industry, pharmaceutical etc. This has prompted mathematicians to explore NN technique to get the approximate solutions of many physical problems for which analytical solutions may not exist. In mathematical modelling, differential equations play a crucial role for solving the physical problems. In this paper, application of NN as universal solvers for Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) and Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) has been explained. The Neural Network is developed for initial and boundary value problems of different order ODEs and PDEs. The main objective here is to develop the single neural network for solving these equations. This is achieved by applying back-propagation learning algorithm with single layer and logistic sigmoid function. The results are tested for different number of neurons and various losses are generated to get the best loss corresponding to the output.

The self-driving object is an emerging technology that has the potential to transform the entire planet. The steering control of an automated item is critical to ensuring a safe and secure voyage. Consequently, in this study, we developed a methodology for predicting the steering angle only by looking at the front images of a vehicle. In addition, we used an Internet of Things-based system for collecting front images and steering angles. A Raspberry Pi (RP) camera is used in conjunction with a Raspberry Pi (RP) processing unit to capture images from vehicles, and the RP processing unit is used to collect the angles associated with each image. Apart from that, we've made use of deep learning-based algorithms such as VGG16, ResNet-152, DenseNet-201, and Nvidia's models, all of which were trained using labeled training data. Our models are End-to-End CNN models, which do not require extracting elements from data such as roads, lanes, or other objects before predicting steering angle. As a result of our comparative investigation, we can conclude that the Nvidia model's performance was satisfactory, with a Mean Squared Error (MSE) value of 0.3521. But the Nvidia model outperforms the other pre-trained models, even though other models work well.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-4 Sept. 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9596499/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9596499/","publicationDate":"3 Sept. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2021","conferenceDate":"3-4 Sept. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Comparative Analysis of Steering Angle Prediction for Automated Object using Deep Neural Network","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparative Analysis of Steering Angle Prediction for Automated Object using Deep Neural Network","confLoc":"Noida, India","sourcePdf":"ICRITO2021Paper1628.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.093946S","chronDate":"3-4 Sept. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9596064","isNumber":"9596065","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9596064","xplore-issue":"9596065","articleId":"9596499","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":9596526,"authors":[{"name":"Victor Sanchez","affiliation":["University of Warwick, UK"],"firstName":"Victor","lastName":"Sanchez","id":"37394525300"},{"name":"Miguel Hern\u00e1ndez-Cabronero","affiliation":["Universitat Aut\u00f2noma de Barcelona, Spain"],"firstName":"Miguel","lastName":"Hern\u00e1ndez-Cabronero","id":"38340274700"},{"name":"Joan Serra-Sagrist\u00e0","affiliation":["Universitat Aut\u00f2noma de Barcelona, Spain"],"firstName":"Joan","lastName":"Serra-Sagrist\u00e0","id":"38276160300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-6338-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-1184-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"1551-2541"}],"articleNumber":"9596526","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":3},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Conferences","Neural networks","Training data","Imaging","Machine learning","Signal processing","Video codecs"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["online learning","intra-prediction","overfitted neural networks"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9596526","abstract":"Block-wise intra-prediction is a key technique used by modern video codecs to reduce the amount of data to be compressed. Recently, machine learning (ML) has successfully improved block-wise intra-prediction by employing neural networks. Notwithstanding, the performance of such ML-based methods depends on the amount, quality, and relevance of the training data. Furthermore, they require signalling the learned parameters into the bitstream to be able to reconstruct the original data after decompression, thus increasing bitrates. This work proposes a novel block-wise intra-prediction strategy based on fully connected neural networks (FC-NNs) that avoids the two aforementioned shortcomings within the context of lossless compression. To do so, shallow FC-NNs are used, whose parameters are refined in an on-line manner using only the data being predicted. This allows to accurately fit the FC-NNs to the data of interest and replicate the optimization process, avoiding signaling the learned parameters. Experimental results indicate that the proposed ML-based intra-prediction strategy can outperform the intra-prediction used by modern video codecs with prediction accuracy gains of up to 7.01 dB PSNR.","doi":"10.1109/MLSP52302.2021.9596526","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 31st International Workshop on Machine Learning for Signal Processing (MLSP)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MLSP52302.2021.9596526","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9596068","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 31st International Workshop on Machine Learning for Signal Processing (MLSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9596063/9596068/09596526.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Block-Wise Intra-Prediction of Imaging Data Based on Overfitted Neural Networks with On-Line Learning","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9596526/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Block-Wise Intra-Prediction of Imaging Data Based on Overfitted Neural Networks with On-Line Learning","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9596526/","publicationDate":"25 Oct. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2021","conferenceDate":"25-28 Oct. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 Oct. 2021","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Block-Wise Intra-Prediction of Imaging Data Based on Overfitted Neural Networks with On-Line Learning","confLoc":"Gold Coast, Australia","sourcePdf":"70.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070957S","chronDate":"25-28 Oct. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9596063","isNumber":"9596068","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9596063","xplore-issue":"9596068","articleId":"9596526","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":9596542,"authors":[{"name":"J.

To address this challenge, we propose a Hardware-Oriented Memory-Limited Online ASR (HMO-ASR) algorithm. The proposed HMO-ASR algorithm consists of (1) two-level window-based preprocessing including PCA-based and z-score-based preprocessing to clean the data in each window, (2) iterative mean, standard deviation, and covariance update using a parallel algorithm to achieve window-based processing, and (3) early eigenvector matrix determination to save the computation. With the three schemes, the HMO-ASR method can be implemented on mobile devices, application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) or field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) with limited memory. The study results showed that the proposed HMO-ASR algorithm can achieve comparable performance to those obtained by the offline ASR algorithm with a 98.64% reduction in memory size.

In this article, we present a thorough and comprehensive survey of the literature surrounding edge intelligence. We first identify four fundamental components of edge intelligence, i.e., edge caching, edge training, edge inference, and edge offloading based on theoretical and practical results pertaining to proposed and deployed systems. We then aim for a systematic classification of the state of the solutions by examining research results and observations for each of the four components and present a taxonomy that includes practical problems, adopted techniques, and application goals. For each category, we elaborate, compare, and analyze the literature from the perspectives of adopted techniques, objectives, performance, advantages and drawbacks, and so on. This article provides a comprehensive survey of edge intelligence and its application areas. In addition, we summarize the development of the emerging research fields and the current state of the art and discuss the important open issues and possible theoretical and technical

proposed. The input of ANN is a vector composed of radiated electric or magnetic fields in the near-field region of the unknown radiator, and the output is the value of 3-meter field in the far-field region. We verified the effectiveness of the proposed method by the simulation data, where the randomly distributed dipoles are taken as the unknown radiator. The trained ANN model can directly predict the 3-meter field by the scanned near-field of dipoles. Compared with other near-field to far-field transform methods, the major benefit of the proposed method is its robust and efficiency.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 Sept. 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9596690/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9596690/","publicationDate":"27 Sept. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"16 November 2021","conferenceDate":"27-30 Sept. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Reactive Near-field to 3-Meter Field Transformation Based on Artificial Neural Networks","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100015224","fundingName":"Science and Technology Project of State Grid Zhejiang Electric Power Co., Ltd.","grantNumber":"5211DS180039"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61871467,62027805"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reactive Near-field to 3-Meter Field Transformation Based on Artificial Neural Networks","confLoc":"Nusa Dua - Bali, Indonesia","sourcePdf":"016_PID1570725916_cr.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042595S","chronDate":"27-30 Sept. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9596615","isNumber":"9596636","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9596615","xplore-issue":"9596636","articleId":"9596690","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":9596713,"authors":[{"name":"Amarildo Rista","affiliation":["Faculty of Contemporary Sciences and Technologies, SEE University, Tetovo, North Macedonia"],"firstName":"Amarildo","lastName":"Rista","id":"37085710094"},{"name":"Arbana Kadriu","affiliation":["Faculty of Contemporary Sciences and Technologies, SEE University, Tetovo, North Macedonia"],"firstName":"Arbana","lastName":"Kadriu","id":"37847715800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-953-233-101-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-953-233-101-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4761-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2623-8764"}],"articleNumber":"9596713","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":10},"abstract":"Deep learning technology nowadays is considered one of the most advances in machine learning that have led to significant and widespread improvements in how people interact with the world.

Recently Deep Learning is well known for its applicability in speech recognition. This stems mainly by the flexibility and predicting power of deep neural networks. This research paper introduces an end-to-end speech recognition model applicable for Albanian language. The model is based on Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) architecture, which will be created and implemented in Pytorch tool. It is composed by two main neural network modules - N layers of Residual Convolutional Neural Networks (ResCNN) to learn the relevant audio features, and a set of Bidirectional Recurrent Neural Networks (BiRNN) to leverage the learned ResCNN audio features. The model will be trained and evaluated using a corpus in Albanian, created for this purpose and a corpus in English derived by LibriSpeech. The experimental results show a very satisfactory WER, CER and Loss.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Deep learning","Recurrent neural networks","Speech recognition","Tools","Brain modeling","Convolutional neural networks","Biological neural networks"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Deep learning","Albanian language","end-to-end ASR"]}],"doi":"10.23919/MIPRO52101.2021.9596713","publicationTitle":"2021 44th International Convention on Information, Communication and Electronic Technology (MIPRO)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 44th International Convention on Information, Communication and Electronic Technology (MIPRO)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9594913/9596611/09596713.pdf","startPage":"442","endPage":"446","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9596611","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/MIPRO52101.2021.9596713","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"End-to-End Speech Recognition Model Based on Deep Learning for Albanian","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9596713","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"End-to-End Speech Recognition Model Based on Deep Learning for Albanian","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9596713/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"27 Sept. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9596713/","conferenceDate":"27 Sept.-1 Oct. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 27 2021-Oct. 1 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"End-to-End Speech Recognition Model Based on Deep Learning for Albanian","confLoc":"Opatija, Croatia","sourcePdf":"0442-0446.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061863S","chronDate":"Sept. 27 2021-Oct. 1 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9594913","isNumber":"9596611","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9594913","xplore-issue":"9596611","articleId":"9596713","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-26"},{"_id":9596852,"authors":[{"name":"Jurica Kundrata","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computing, University of Zagreb, Zagreb, Croatia"],"firstName":"Jurica","lastName":"Kundrata"},{"name":"Dubravko Tomi\u0107","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computing, University of Zagreb, Zagreb, Croatia"],"firstName":"Dubravko","lastName":"Tomi\u0107"},{"name":"Ivan Mareti\u0107","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computing, University of Zagreb, Zagreb, Croatia"],"firstName":"Ivan","lastName":"Mareti\u0107"},{"name":"Adrijan Bari\u0107","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computing, University of Zagreb, Zagreb, Croatia"],"firstName":"Adrijan","lastName":"Bari\u0107"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-953-233-101-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-953-233-101-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4761-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2623-8764"}],"articleNumber":"9596852","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9596852","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Measurement units","Atmospheric measurements","Pipelines","Particle measurements","Information filters","Particle filters","Software"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["particle filters","digital integrated circuits","microprocessor core"]}],"doi":"10.23919/MIPRO52101.2021.9596852","publicationTitle":"2021 44th International Convention on Information, Communication and Electronic Technology (MIPRO)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 44th International Convention on Information, Communication and Electronic Technology (MIPRO)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9594913/9596611/09596852.pdf","startPage":"154","endPage":"159","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/MIPRO52101.2021.9596852","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9596611","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Particle filter implemented as a hardware accelerator in Cortex-M core periphery","abstract":"Particle filters are a group of filtering methods based on recursive Bayesian filters which can be used to estimate the state of an observed dynamical system. The main advantage of the particle filters when compared to other similar filtering methods is that it can handle a nonlinear system which includes non-Gaussian noise sources. A hardware accelerator represents a digital module which is specifically made to perform some function. The module is adapted exclusively to the designed function which the module executes more efficiently and faster than it is possible using a software implementation on a general-purpose processing core. This paper analyses a hardware accelerator which implements a particle filter used in the inertial measurement unit (IMU) measurements. The accelerator is used in periphery of a low power and low gate count Cortex-M1 core. The accelerator is evaluated with respect to the area utilization and execution performance and it is compared to a software implementation of an equivalent particle filter executed on the Cortex-M1 core. The results show that the hardware accelerator has a 30% smaller cell count than the accompanying Cortex-M1 core. The hardware implementation of the particle filter has a two-orders of magnitude shorter execution time than the reference software implementation running on the Cortex-M1 core.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 27 2021-Oct. 1 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9596852/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"27 Sept. 2021","conferenceDate":"27 Sept.-1 Oct. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9596852/","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Particle filter implemented as a hardware accelerator in Cortex-M core periphery","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004955","fundingName":"FFG"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Particle filter implemented as a hardware accelerator in Cortex-M core periphery","confLoc":"Opatija, Croatia","sourcePdf":"0154-0159.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070439S","chronDate":"Sept. 27 2021-Oct. 1 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9594913","isNumber":"9596611","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9594913","xplore-issue":"9596611","articleId":"9596852","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-18"},{"_id":9596861,"authors":[{"name":"Xiang Gao","affiliation":["School of International Education, Beijing University of Chemical Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xiang","lastName":"Gao","id":"37089035037"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3718-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3717-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3719-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9596861","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":14},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9596861","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Visualization","Uncertainty","Neural networks","Soft robotics","Control systems","Manipulators","Steady-state"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["robotic control system","neural network","soft robot","formation control","manipulator control"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ISRIMT53730.2021.9596861","pdfPath":"/iel7/9596614/9596639/09596861.pdf","publicationTitle":"2021 3rd International Symposium on Robotics & Intelligent Manufacturing Technology (ISRIMT)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 3rd International Symposium on Robotics & Intelligent Manufacturing Technology (ISRIMT)","startPage":"37","endPage":"41","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9596639","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISRIMT53730.2021.9596861","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Formation control, manipulator control and soft robot based on neural network control system","abstract":"Recent years, significant efforts for the applications of neural network on robotic adaptive control system are presented in many good quality research papers. Because neural network can learn to adapt to environmental changes and approximate functions, it is widely used in control systems. In order to further develop intelligent control, the application of learning neural network in control system is very important. In this paper, variety of schemes and molds on applications of N eural Networks (NN s) used in robotic area are reviewed and discussed in order to have an outlook of how Neural Network have been utilized in control of robots. By analyzing the existing research, the author found that the neural network has been well developed in the control system and used as a function approximator as usual. In fact, neural networks are sometimes used to control a single part of the system. For example, visual recognition using convolutional neural network in formation control, neural network as a general approximator to deal with the uncertain nonlinearity or uncertainty of the control system, such as radial basis function neural network (RBFNN) and so on. ThenDa new soft climbing robot based on Neural Networks, which is designed by author, is discussed in this paper to show some future directions of robotic control system.

In order to successfully recognize individuals using fingerprints, the biometric samples need to be prepared first. This is particularly important for latent fingerprints, which are captured in unconstrained environments, e.g., crime scenes, and usually contain a significant amount of background noise. The first step is to segment the friction ridge impression from the background and determine the region of interest for further processing. In this paper we compare some of the most popular state-of-the-art methods for semantic image segmentation (FCN, UNet, SegNet, PSPNet) and use them to tackle latent fingerprint segmentation. We evaluate trained models on the IIITD MSLFD dataset and compare our results against the state-of-the-art for latent fingerprint segmentation, SegFinNet. We show that unmodified generic architectures are able to match the more complex SegFinNet in terms of false detection rate (FDR) and intersection over union (IoU), with greatly improved computational speed, reducing time required to process single batch by up to four times.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image segmentation","Computational modeling","Friction","Semantics","Computer architecture","Fingerprint recognition","Predictive models"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["latent fingerprints","convolutional neural networks","biometrics","semantic segmentation"]}],"doi":"10.23919/MIPRO52101.2021.9597100","publicationTitle":"2021 44th International Convention on Information, Communication and Electronic Technology (MIPRO)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 44th International Convention on Information, Communication and Electronic Technology (MIPRO)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9594913/9596611/09597100.pdf","startPage":"1010","endPage":"1014","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9596611","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/MIPRO52101.2021.9597100","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Automatic Latent Fingerprint Segmentation Using Convolutional Neural Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9597100","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Automatic Latent Fingerprint Segmentation Using Convolutional Neural Networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9597100/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"27 Sept. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9597100/","conferenceDate":"27 Sept.-1 Oct. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 27 2021-Oct. 1 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automatic Latent Fingerprint Segmentation Using Convolutional Neural Networks","confLoc":"Opatija, Croatia","sourcePdf":"1010-1014.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.085813S","chronDate":"Sept. 27 2021-Oct. 1 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9594913","isNumber":"9596611","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9594913","xplore-issue":"9596611","articleId":"9597100","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-26"},{"_id":9597213,"authors":[{"name":"Alfonso Maria Ponsiglione","affiliation":["University of Naples Federico II, Naples, Italy"],"firstName":"Alfonso Maria","lastName":"Ponsiglione","id":"37089035570"},{"name":"Giuseppe Cesarelli","affiliation":["University of Naples Federico II, Naples, Italy"],"firstName":"Giuseppe","lastName":"Cesarelli","id":"37088440541"},{"name":"Francesco Amato","affiliation":["University of Naples Federico II, Naples, Italy"],"firstName":"Francesco","lastName":"Amato","id":"37285462900"},{"name":"Maria Romano","affiliation":["University of Naples Federico II, Naples, Italy"],"firstName":"Maria","lastName":"Romano","id":"37594411900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4135-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4134-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4136-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2687-6817"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2687-6809"}],"articleNumber":"9597213","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":8},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9597213","abstract":"Given the importance of accelerations of the foetal health rate (FHR) in the monitoring of the foetal wellbeing along the course of the pregnancy, and taking into consideration the contribution of computerized analysis of biosignals as well as the emerging role of artificial intelligence in medicine, this study describes the optimization and use of artificial neural networks (ANNs) as a tool for predicting and investigating FHR accelerations. To this aim, nineteen features have been extracted from 187 FHR signals recorded from healthy women by cardiotocography. Three training methods, including Levenberg-Marquardt (LM), Scaled Conjugate Gradient (SCG), and Bayesian Regularization (BR), have been tested by training ANNs with increasing number of neurons in the hidden layer. The optimal network configuration has been selected by checking at the coefficient of determination (R2) and the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE).

Unfortunately most of them uses FP32 (32bits floating point) or INT8 (8bits integer) precision for activation and weights. Communities such as TinyML are paying more and more attention to memory and energy-saving to achieve mW and below power consumptions and therefore to Deeply Quantized Neural Networks (DQNNs). Two frameworks: QKeras and Larq, are gaining momentum for defining and training DQNNs. To best of our knowledge, the only available zoo for DQNN is the Larq framework. In this work we developed a new QKeras zoo and comparing the accuracy with the available Larq zoo. To avoid costly re-training, we show how to re-use the weights from Larq zoo. We also developed the zoo with ten networks and matched the performance of the Larq zoo for seven out of ten networks. Our work will be made publicly available through a GitHub repository.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9597341/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-9 Sept. 2021","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"6-9 Sept. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9597341/","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2021","publicationDate":"6 Sept. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A QKeras Neural Network Zoo for Deeply Quantized Imaging","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A QKeras Neural Network Zoo for Deeply Quantized Imaging","confLoc":"Naples, Italy","sourcePdf":"30.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064945S","chronDate":"6-9 Sept. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9597204","isNumber":"9597208","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9597204","xplore-issue":"9597208","articleId":"9597341","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-26"},{"_id":9597387,"authors":[{"name":"Piergiulio Mannocci","affiliation":["Informazione e Bioingegneria, Politecnico di Milano, Milan, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/9629436/9597387/manno-3122278-small.gif","p":["Piergiulio Mannocci (Graduate Student Member, IEEE) received the B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees from the Politecnico di Milano, Milan, Italy, in 2016 and 2020, respectively, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree.

Among the new paradigms, in-memory computing (IMC) with analogue devices is attracting significant interest for its large-scale integration potential, together with unrivaled speed and energy performance. Here, we present a fully-analogue, universal primitive capable of executing linear algebra operations such as regression, generalized least-square minimization and linear system solution with and without preconditioning. We study the impact of the main circuit parameters on accuracy and bandwidth with analytical closed-form expressions and SPICE simulations. Scaling challenges due to parasitic resistance/capacitance and their impact on key parameters such as bandwidth and accuracy are discussed. Finally, a comparison with existing solvers belonging to the same IMC framework is made to assess advantages and disadvantages of the proposed circuit.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Universal, Analog, In-Memory Computing Primitive for Linear Algebra Using Memristors","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2021.3122278","endPage":"4899","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel7/8919/9629436/09597387.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","startPage":"4889","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2021.3122278","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9629436","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9597387","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Linear systems","Integrated circuit modeling","Linear regression","Mathematical models","Covariance matrices","Bandwidth","SPICE"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["In-memory computing","resistive memory","hardware accelerator","linear regression","linear systems"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Universal, Analog, In-Memory Computing Primitive for Linear Algebra Using Memristors","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9597387/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 November 2021","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2021","volume":"68","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/9597387/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"30 November 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000781","fundingName":"European Research Council","grantNumber":"ERC-PoC-2018-842472-CIRCUS and ERC-CoG-2014-648635-RESCUE"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Universal, Analog, In-Memory Computing Primitive for Linear Algebra Using Memristors","sourcePdf":"tcsi-mannocci-3122278-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.096071S","chronDate":"Dec.  2021","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"9629436","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","xplore-issue":"9629436","articleId":"9597387","onlineDate":"13 November 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-01"},{"_id":9597469,"authors":[{"name":"Mohamed Elshamy","affiliation":["Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS), LIP6, Sorbonne Universit\u00e9, Paris, France","Laboratory of Nanotechnology Application in Electronics, Electronics Research Institute, Cairo, Egypt"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/92/9627316/9597469/elsha-3117584-small.gif","p":["Mohamed Elshamy received the M.Sc. degree in electronics and communications engineering from Cairo University, Giza, Egypt, in 2015, and the Ph.D. degree from Sorbonne Universit\u00e9, Paris, France, in 2021.","He is currently a Research Assistant in electronics with the Laboratory of Nanotechnology Application, Electronics Research Institute, Cairo, Egypt.

The security approach relies on functionality locking by leveraging the inherent programmability and utilizing the configuration settings as secret keys or, equivalently, the programming bits as key bits. When invalid keys are applied, the circuit is untuned and, as a result, its functionality breaks, i.e., at least one of the performances violates its specification. As long as the calibration algorithm that produces the configuration settings can be kept secret, the proposed approach can serve as a countermeasure against all types of counterfeiting, i.e., cloning, overbuilding, remarking, and recycling. An important advantage of the proposed approach is that it is lock-less. It leaves the design intact, there is no change to the design flow, and there are no performance penalty and no area or power overheads due to the lock operation.

In previous studies, many studies recognized texts containing positive, negative and neutral sentiments, but few studies focus on emotions according to multiple categories, such as happiness, sadness, anger, fear, disgust and surprise. In this paper, we propose an individual emotion-identifying model called semantic emoticon emotion recognition (SEER). First, we divide the input short text into four categories by using the emotion dictionary and emoticons. Second, we combine a bidirectional gated recurrent unit (Bi-GRU) network with an attention mechanism to capture the emotion vectors of input text from the word aspect. Third, we construct an emoticon distribution model to obtain the emotion vectors in a large quantity of social network data. Fourth, according to different types of input short texts, we select different fusion weights to fuse the emoticon emotion features in text and the semantic emotion features of the texts. Finally, we classify the short text emotions into six categories depending on the final emotion vector. The experimental results show that the SEER is an effective method for improving the accuracy of emotion recognition. In addition, our proposed approach achieves the highest accuracy of 86.35% in emotion recognition, which indicates that the accuracy of our proposed approach achieves improvements of 12.66%, 14.56%, 5.38%, 4.48%, 4.9%, 2.68%, and 3.17% compared to SVM, WL, LSTM, BiLSTM, GRU, Bi-GRU, and CNN+BiLSTM, respectively.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 November 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9597507/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","volume":"9","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"2021","isOpenAccess":true,"dateOfInsertion":"17 December 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9597507/","displayDocTitle":"Individual Emotion Recognition Approach Combined Gated Recurrent Unit With Emoticon Distribution Model","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation","grantNumber":"61872298 and 61802316"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004829","fundingName":"Science and Technology Department of Sichuan Province","grantNumber":"2021YFQ0008"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Individual Emotion Recognition Approach Combined Gated Recurrent Unit With Emoticon Distribution Model","sourcePdf":"access-du-3124585-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.087307S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"9312710","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","xplore-issue":"9312710","articleId":"9597507","onlineDate":"13 November 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-12-24"},{"_id":9597514,"authors":[{"name":"Bo Li","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Integrated Services Networks, School of Telecommunications Engineering, Xidian University, Xi\u2019an, China"],"firstName":"Bo","lastName":"Li","orcid":"0000-0003-4417-2691"},{"name":"Jianping Zheng","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Integrated Services Networks, School of Telecommunications Engineering, Xidian University, Xi\u2019an, China"],"firstName":"Jianping","lastName":"Zheng","orcid":"0000-0002-4244-9223"},{"name":"Yaoxin Gao","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Integrated Services Networks, School of Telecommunications Engineering, Xidian University, Xi\u2019an, China"],"firstName":"Yaoxin","lastName":"Gao","orcid":"0000-0003-1609-6425"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"9597514","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":101},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Heuristic algorithms","Matching pursuit algorithms","Multiuser detection","Message passing","Correlation","Channel estimation","NOMA"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Grant-free","non-orthogonal multiple access","compressed sensing","message passing","multiuser detection"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9597514","doi":"10.1109/LCOMM.2021.3124608","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCOMM.2021.3124608","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9674048","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/4234/9674048/09597514.pdf","startPage":"143","endPage":"147","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Compressed Sensing Based Multiuser Detection of Grant-Free NOMA With Dynamic User Activity","abstract":"In this letter, by exploiting both the temporal correlation of active user and signal statistical information, we propose a compressed sensing based multi-user detection for uplink grant-free non-orthogonal multiple access where the user activity varies dynamically in one frame consisting of multiple time slots.

One of the most widely investigated DL algorithms is the convolutional neural network (CNN), which has been proven to have strong feature extraction capability. However, the training of CNN requires large samples and thus entails a heavy computational load, resulting in high hardware and software costs.

There have been a number of research studies that have presented bitcoin price prediction models, but none of them have looked at the controlling variables linked with bitcoin transaction timestamps. It might be that price is not the only key criteria influencing bitcoin transactions, or the available model for bitcoin price prediction is yet to consider timestamp as a determining factor in its transaction. A better and more accurate model would be required to predict how the Timestamp influences changes of bitcoin transactions. That is why this current study utilized a Nonlinear Autoregressive Exogenous (NARX) Neural Network Model for the prediction of timestamp influence on Bitcoin value. Bitcoin historical datasets which are converted to a nonlinear regression into a \u201cwell-formulated\u201d statistical problem in the manner of a ridge regression are used. Simulation analysis indicates that bitcoin digital currency\u2019s performance variation is highly influenced by its transaction timestamp with the prediction accuracy of 96%. The contributions of this research lies with the fact that specific Bitcoin transaction events repeat themselves over and over again, meaning that the Open-Price, High-Price, Low-Price, and Close-Price of Bitcoin price over timestamp developed a pattern that was predicted by NARX with less That means those involved in the transaction of bitcoin at the wrong timestamp will certainly face the uncertainty negative effect of the bitcoin market.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9597552/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 November 2021","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"volume":"9","htmlLink":"/document/9597552/","publicationDate":"2021","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Nonlinear Autoregressive Exogenous (NARX) Neural Network Model for the Prediction of Timestamp Influence on Bitcoin Value","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100015624","fundingName":"Deanship of Scientific Research (DSR), University of Jeddah, Jeddah","grantNumber":"UJ-20-121-DR"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"A Nonlinear Autoregressive Exogenous (NARX) Neural Network Model for the Prediction of Timestamp Influence on Bitcoin Value","sourcePdf":"access-aljojo-3124629-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.110076S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"9312710","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","xplore-issue":"9312710","articleId":"9597552","onlineDate":"01 November 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-11-17"},{"_id":9597562,"authors":[{"name":"Michael P.

Although the fundamental technology is not yet mature, research on quantum internet should be conducted. To implement quantum internet, an architecture that describes how quantum nodes are linked to form networks and how protocol functions are vertically composed need to be developed urgently. In this paper, we present a novel design of a cluster-based structure to describe how quantum nodes are interconnected, and how the structure can improve the performance of qubit transmission and reduce the network complexity. The idea of the quantum local area network (QLAN) is proposed as an essential component of the quantum internet. Besides, each quantum repeater links to neighboring repeaters to form a core network, and multiple QLANs are connected through the core network. The core network can be grouped into different hierarchical quantum repeater networks according to needed service requirements. For the sake of interoperability and fast prototyping, we adopt the idea of OSI layering model of the current Internet in the design of quantum internet. Finally, we elaborate on the composition of quantum nodes and the realization of end-to-end communication.","displayPublicationTitle":"China Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/6245522/9597610/09597613.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"14","publicationTitle":"China Communications","doi":"10.23919/JCC.2021.10.001","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/JCC.2021.10.001","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9597610","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9597613","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Building a large-scale and wide-area quantum Internet based on an OSI-alike model","keywords":[{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["quantum internet","entanglement swapping","quantum repeater","teleportation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9597613/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2021","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 November 2021","displayDocTitle":"Building a large-scale and wide-area quantum Internet based on an OSI-alike model","volume":"18","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"01 November 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Building a large-scale and wide-area quantum Internet based on an OSI-alike model","sourcePdf":"1.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.019372S","chronDate":"Oct.  2021","isNumber":"9597610","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6245522","articleId":"9597613","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-11-01"},{"_id":9597634,"authors":[{"name":"Ning Liu","affiliation":["School of Electronics, Information and Electrical Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai 200240, China"],"firstName":"Ning","lastName":"Liu"},{"name":"Kuikui Li","affiliation":["Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd., Shanghai 201206, China"],"firstName":"Kuikui","lastName":"Li"},{"name":"Meixia Tao","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai 200240, China"],"firstName":"Meixia","lastName":"Tao"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1673-5447"}],"articleNumber":"9597634","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"keywords":[{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["mobile edge computing","distributed matrix multiplication","coded computing","cooperative transmission"]}],"abstract":"This paper exploits coding to speed up computation offloading in a multi-server mobile edge computing (MEC) network with straggling servers and channel fading. The specific task we consider is to compute the product between a user-generated input data matrix and a large-scale model matrix that is stored distributively across the multiple edge nodes. The key idea of coding is to introduce computation redundancy to improve robustness against straggling servers and to create communication redundancy to improve reliability against channel fading. We utilize the hybrid design of maximum distance separable (MDS) coding and repetition coding. Based on the hybrid coding scheme, we conduct theoretical analysis on the average task uploading time, average edge computing time, and average output downloading time, respectively and then obtain the end-to-end task execution time. Numerical results demonstrate that when the task uploading phase or the edge computing phase is the performance bottleneck, the hybrid coding reduces to MDS coding; when the downlink transmission is the bottleneck, the hybrid coding reduces to repetition coding. The hybrid coding also outperforms the entangled polynomial coding that causes higher uplink and downlink communication loads.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Code design and latency analysis of distributed matrix multiplication with straggling servers in fading channels","publicationTitle":"China Communications","doi":"10.23919/JCC.2021.10.002","displayPublicationTitle":"China Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/6245522/9597610/09597634.pdf","startPage":"15","endPage":"29","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/JCC.2021.10.002","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9597610","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9597634","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9597634/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 November 2021","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2021","displayDocTitle":"Code design and latency analysis of distributed matrix multiplication with straggling servers in fading channels","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"18","issue":"10","dateOfInsertion":"01 November 2021","publicationDate":"Oct. 2021","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Code design and latency analysis of distributed matrix multiplication with straggling servers in fading channels","sourcePdf":"2.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.013266S","chronDate":"Oct.  2021","isNumber":"9597610","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6245522","articleId":"9597634","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-11-01"},{"_id":9597635,"authors":[{"name":"Demin Gao","affiliation":["College of Information Science and Technology, Nanjing Forestry University, Nanjing 210037, China; Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Minnesota, 55414, USA"],"firstName":"Demin","lastName":"Gao"},{"name":"Zhihao Guan","affiliation":["College of Information Science and Technology, Nanjing Forestry University, Nanjing 210037, China"],"firstName":"Zhihao","lastName":"Guan"},{"name":"Shuo Zhang","affiliation":["College of Information Science and Technology, Nanjing Forestry University, Nanjing 210037, China"],"firstName":"Shuo","lastName":"Zhang"},{"name":"Bin Hu","affiliation":["College of Artificial Intelligence, Nanjing Agriculture University, Nanjing 210095, China"],"firstName":"Bin","lastName":"Hu"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1673-5447"}],"articleNumber":"9597635","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"keywords":[{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["network throughput","cross-technology communication","sensor networks"]}],"abstract":"The exponentially increasing number of heterogeneous Internet of Things (IoT) devices (e.g., WiFi and ZigBee) crowed in the same ISM band (2.4G) and recent advances in Cross-Technology Communications (CTC) motivate us to explore more efficient data collection and maximize network throughput.

In this work, we propose a distributed algorithm, named MaxBee, to compute the maximum network throughput, which is formulated as a linear programming problem. Considering that the problem turns out to be non-convex and hard to solve exactly, we propose a distributed algorithm to solve nonlinear programming by using the dual decomposition method and gradient/subgradient algorithms.

The goal of this paper is to recover the line spectral as well as its corresponding parameters including the model order, frequencies and amplitudes from heavily quantized samples. To this end, we propose an efficient grid-less Bayesian algorithm named VALSE-EP, which is a combination of the high resolution and low complexity gridless variational line spectral estimation (VALSE) and expectation propagation (EP). The basic idea of VALSE-EP is to iteratively approximate the challenging quantized model of line spectral estimation as a sequence of simple pseudo unquantized models, where VALSE is applied. Moreover, to obtain a benchmark of the performance of the proposed algorithm, the Cramer Rao bound (CRB) is derived. Finally, numerical experiments on both synthetic and real data are performed, demonstrating the near CRB performance of the proposed VALSE-EP for line spectral estimation from quantized samples.","displayPublicationTitle":"China Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/6245522/9597610/09597637.pdf","startPage":"77","endPage":"95","publicationTitle":"China Communications","doi":"10.23919/JCC.2021.10.005","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/JCC.2021.10.005","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9597610","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9597637","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Gridless variational Bayesian inference of line spectral from quantized samples","keywords":[{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["variational Bayesian inference","expectation propagation","quantization","line spectral estimation","mmse","gridless"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9597637/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2021","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 November 2021","displayDocTitle":"Gridless variational Bayesian inference of line spectral from quantized samples","volume":"18","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"01 November 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Gridless variational Bayesian inference of line spectral from quantized samples","sourcePdf":"5.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.017029S","chronDate":"Oct.  2021","isNumber":"9597610","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6245522","articleId":"9597637","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-11-01"},{"_id":9597638,"authors":[{"name":"Zhongjie Li","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Information Engineering, South Central University for Nationalities, Wuhan 430074, China"],"firstName":"Zhongjie","lastName":"Li"},{"name":"Wei Gao","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Information Engineering, South Central University for Nationalities, Wuhan 430074, China"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Gao"},{"name":"Min Zhang","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Information Engineering, South Central University for Nationalities, Wuhan 430074, China"],"firstName":"Min","lastName":"Zhang"},{"name":"Jiyuan Xiong","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Information Engineering, South Central University for Nationalities, Wuhan 430074, China"],"firstName":"Jiyuan","lastName":"Xiong"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1673-5447"}],"articleNumber":"9597638","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"keywords":[{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["millimeter wave","massive MIMO","hybrid precoding","uniform channel decomposition","multitask learning"]}],"abstract":"Due to the different signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of each subchannel, the bit error rate (BER) of hybrid precoding based on singular value decomposition (SVD) decreases. In this paper, we propose a multi-task learning based precoding network (PN) model to solve the BER loss problem caused by SVD based hybrid precoding under imperfect channel state information (CSI). Specifically, we firstly generate a dataset including imcomplete CSI input channel matrix and corresponding output labels to train the PN model. The output labels are designed based on uniform channel decomposition (UCD) which decomposes the channel into multiple subchannels with same gain, while the vertical-bell layered space-time structure (V-BLAST) signal processing technology is combined to eliminate the inner interference of the subchannels. Then, the PN model is trained to design the analog and digital precoding/combining matrix simultaneous. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme has only negligible gap in spectrum efficiency compared with the fully digital precoding, while achieves better BER performance than SVD based hybrid precoding.","doi":"10.23919/JCC.2021.10.006","publicationTitle":"China Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"China Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/6245522/9597610/09597638.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/JCC.2021.10.006","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9597610","startPage":"96","endPage":"106","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-task deep learning based hybrid precoding for mmWave massive MIMO system","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9597638","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Multi-task deep learning based hybrid precoding for mmWave massive MIMO system","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9597638/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 November 2021","isJournal":true,"volume":"18","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"01 November 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-task deep learning based hybrid precoding for mmWave massive MIMO system","sourcePdf":"6.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.018135S","chronDate":"Oct.  2021","isNumber":"9597610","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6245522","articleId":"9597638","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-11-01"},{"_id":9597639,"authors":[{"name":"Zheng Shi","affiliation":["School of Intelligent Systems Science and Engineering, Jinan University, Zhuhai 519070, China; State Key Laboratory of Internet of Things for Smart City and the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Macau, Macao 999078, China"],"firstName":"Zheng","lastName":"Shi"},{"name":"Hong Wang","affiliation":["School of Communication and Information Engineering, Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Nanjing 210003, China"],"firstName":"Hong","lastName":"Wang"},{"name":"Yaru Fu","affiliation":["School of Science and Technology, Hong Kong Metropolitan University, Hong Kong SAR, China"],"firstName":"Yaru","lastName":"Fu"},{"name":"Guanghua Yang","affiliation":["School of Intelligent Systems Science and Engineering, Jinan University, Zhuhai 519070, China"],"firstName":"Guanghua","lastName":"Yang"},{"name":"Shaodan Ma","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Internet of Things for Smart City and the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Macau, Macao 999078, China"],"firstName":"Shaodan","lastName":"Ma"},{"name":"Xinrong Ye","affiliation":["School of Physics and Electronic Information, Anhui Normal University, Wuhu 241002, China"],"firstName":"Xinrong","lastName":"Ye"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1673-5447"}],"articleNumber":"9597639","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"keywords":[{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["imperfect channel-state information (CSI)","multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)","non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA)","small cell networks (SCNs)"]}],"abstract":"This paper focuses on boosting the performance of small cell networks (SCNs) by integrating multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) and nonorthogonal multiple access (NOMA) in consideration of imperfect channel-state information (CSI).

The outage probabilities of MIMO-NOMA enhanced SCNs are first derived in closed-form by taking into account two grouping policies, including random grouping and distance-based grouping. It is revealed that the average outage probabilities are irrelevant to the intensity of BSs in the interference-limited regime, while the outage performance deteriorates if the intensity is sufficiently low. Besides, as the channel uncertainty lessens, the asymptotic analyses manifest that the target rates must be restricted up to a bound to achieve an arbitrarily low outage probability in the absence of the inter-cell interference. Moreover, highly correlated estimation error ameliorates the outage performance under a low quality of CSI, otherwise it behaves oppositely. Afterwards, the goodput is maximized by choosing appropriate precoding matrix, receiver filters and transmission rates. In the end, the numerical results verify our analysis and corroborate the superiority of our proposed algorithm.","doi":"10.23919/JCC.2021.10.007","publicationTitle":"China Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"China Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/6245522/9597610/09597639.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/JCC.2021.10.007","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9597610","startPage":"107","endPage":"128","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Outage performance and optimal design of MIMO-NOMA enhanced small cell networks with imperfect channel-state information","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9597639","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Outage performance and optimal design of MIMO-NOMA enhanced small cell networks with imperfect channel-state information","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9597639/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 November 2021","isJournal":true,"volume":"18","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"01 November 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Outage performance and optimal design of MIMO-NOMA enhanced small cell networks with imperfect channel-state information","sourcePdf":"7.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.017562S","chronDate":"Oct.  2021","isNumber":"9597610","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6245522","articleId":"9597639","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-11-01"},{"_id":9597640,"authors":[{"name":"Qingbo Zhai","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Marine Resource Utilization in South China Sea, College of Information and Communication Engineering, Hainan University, Haikou 570228, Hainan Province, China"],"firstName":"Qingbo","lastName":"Zhai"},{"name":"Yong Bai","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Marine Resource Utilization in South China Sea, College of Information and Communication Engineering, Hainan University, Haikou 570228, Hainan Province, China"],"firstName":"Yong","lastName":"Bai"},{"name":"Dake Liu","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Marine Resource Utilization in South China Sea, College of Information and Communication Engineering, Hainan University, Haikou 570228, Hainan Province, China"],"firstName":"Dake","lastName":"Liu"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1673-5447"}],"articleNumber":"9597640","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"abstract":"This paper proposes a flexible eight-mode high parallel Galois SIMD ASIP(Application Specific Instruction Set Processor).

An accurate form of object tracking task necessitates a robust object tracking procedures irrespective of hardware assistance. Such approaches inferred a vast computational complexity to track an object with high accuracy in a stipulated amount of processing time. On the other hand, the tracking gets affected owing to the existence of varied quality diminishing factors such as occlusion, illumination changes, shadows etc., In order to rectify all these inadequacies in tracking an object, a novel background normalization procedure articulated on the basis of a textural pattern is proposed in this paper. After preprocessing an acquired image, employment of an Environmental Succession Prediction algorithm for discriminating disparate background environment by background clustering approach have been accomplished. Afterward, abstract textural characterizations through utilization of a Probability based Gradient Pattern (PGP) approach for recognizing the similarity between patterns obtained so far. Comparison between standardized frame obtained in prior and those processed patterns detects the motion exposed by an object and the object concerned gets identified within a blob. Hence, the system is resistant towards illumination variations. These illumination variation was interpreted in object tracking residing within a dynamic background. Devised approach certainly outperforms other object tracking methodologies like Group Target Tracking (GTT), ViPER-GT, grabcut, snakes in terms of accuracy and average time.

In this paper, an intelligence enabled physical (PHY-)layer user signature code acquisition (USCA) algorithm is proposed to overcome the random access congestion problem with reduced signaling and control overhead. In the proposed scheme, the detector aims at approximating the optimal observation on both active user detection and user data reception by iteratively learning and predicting the convergence of the user signature codes that are in active. The cross-entropy based low-complexity iterative updating rule is present to guarantee that the proposed USCA algorithm is computational feasible. A closed-form bit error rate (BER) performance analysis is carried out to show the efficiency of the proposed intelligence USCA algorithm. Simulation results confirm that the proposed USCA algorithm provides an inherent tradeoff between performance and complexity and allows the detector achieves an approximate optimal performance with a reasonable computational complexity.","doi":"10.23919/JCC.2021.10.013","publicationTitle":"China Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"China Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/6245522/9597610/09597645.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/JCC.2021.10.013","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9597610","startPage":"181","endPage":"192","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Catalyzing random access at physical layer for Internet of Things: An intelligence enabled user signature code acquisition approach","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9597645","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Catalyzing random access at physical layer for Internet of Things: An intelligence enabled user signature code acquisition approach","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9597645/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 November 2021","isJournal":true,"volume":"18","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"01 November 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Catalyzing random access at physical layer for Internet of Things: An intelligence enabled user signature code acquisition approach","sourcePdf":"13.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.019926S","chronDate":"Oct.  2021","isNumber":"9597610","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6245522","articleId":"9597645","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-11-01"},{"_id":9597646,"authors":[{"name":"Ahmed Bannour","affiliation":["University of Carthage InnovCom Laboratory, Higher School of Communications of Tunis, Sup'Com, Cit\u00e9 Technologique des Communications Route de Raoued Km 3,5 2083 El Ghazala Ariana Tunisie Tunis, Tunisia"],"firstName":"Ahmed","lastName":"Bannour"},{"name":"Yichuang Sun","affiliation":["University of Hertfordshire, School of Engineering and Technology, Hatfield, Herts, AL10 9AB, UK"],"firstName":"Yichuang","lastName":"Sun"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1673-5447"}],"articleNumber":"9597646","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"keywords":[{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["future circular collider","LHC","tunnel","low latency","harsh indoor","wireless communications"]}],"abstract":"The European organization for nuclear research (CERN) is planning a high performance particle collider by 2050, which will update the currently used Large Hadron Collider (LHC). The design of the new experiment facility includes the definition of a suitable communication infrastructure to support the future needs of scientists. The huge amount of data collected by the measurement devices call for a data rate of at least 1Gb/s per node, while the need of timely control of instruments requires a low latency of the order of 0.01\u03bcs. Moreover, the main tunnel will be 100 km long, and will need appropriate coverage for voice and data traffic, in a special underground environment subject also to strong radiations. Reliable voice, data and video transmission in a tunnel of this length is necessary to ensure timely and localized intervention, reducing access time. In addition, using wireless communication for voice, control and data acquisition of accelerator technical systems could lead to a significant reduction in cabling costs, installation times and maintenance efforts. The communication infrastructure of the Future Circular Collider (FCC) tunnel must be able to circumvent the problems of radioactivity, omnipresent in the tunnel. Current technologies transceivers cannot transmit in such a severely radioactive environment. This is due to the immediate destruction of any active or passive equipment by radioactivity. The scope of this paper is to determine the feasibility of robust wireless transmission in an underground radioactive tunnel environment. The network infrastructure design to meet the demand will be introduced, and the performance of different wireless technologies will be evaluated.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Wireless network requirements and solutions for the future circular collider: A hostile indoor environment","publicationTitle":"China Communications","doi":"10.23919/JCC.2021.10.014","displayPublicationTitle":"China Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/6245522/9597610/09597646.pdf","startPage":"193","endPage":"203","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/JCC.2021.10.014","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9597610","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9597646","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9597646/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 November 2021","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2021","displayDocTitle":"Wireless network requirements and solutions for the future circular collider: A hostile indoor environment","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"18","issue":"10","dateOfInsertion":"01 November 2021","publicationDate":"Oct. 2021","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wireless network requirements and solutions for the future circular collider: A hostile indoor environment","sourcePdf":"14.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.019375S","chronDate":"Oct.  2021","isNumber":"9597610","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6245522","articleId":"9597646","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-11-01"},{"_id":9597647,"authors":[{"name":"Bo Chen","affiliation":["Information Technology Institute, Information Engineering University, Zhengzhou 450002, China"],"firstName":"Bo","lastName":"Chen"},{"name":"Penghao Sun","affiliation":["War Research Insititute, Academy of Military Science, Beijing 100091, China"],"firstName":"Penghao","lastName":"Sun"},{"name":"Peng Zhang","affiliation":["Information Technology Institute, Information Engineering University, Zhengzhou 450002, China"],"firstName":"Peng","lastName":"Zhang"},{"name":"Julong Lan","affiliation":["Information Technology Institute, Information Engineering University, Zhengzhou 450002, China"],"firstName":"Julong","lastName":"Lan"},{"name":"Youjun Bu","affiliation":["Information Technology Institute, Information Engineering University, Zhengzhou 450002, China"],"firstName":"Youjun","lastName":"Bu"},{"name":"Juan Shen","affiliation":["Information Technology Institute, Information Engineering University, Zhengzhou 450002, China"],"firstName":"Juan","lastName":"Shen"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1673-5447"}],"articleNumber":"9597647","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"keywords":[{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["SDN","deep reinforcement learning","segment routing","traffic engineering","equal cost multiple paths"]}],"abstract":"Segment Routing (SR) is a new routing paradigm based on source routing and provide traffic engineering (TE) capabilities in IP network.

Hybrid IP/SR network will last for some time. Aiming at the low flexibility problem of static TE policies in the current SR networks, this paper proposes a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) based TE scheme. The proposed scheme employs multi-path transmission and use DRL to dynamically adjust the traffic splitting ratio among different paths based on the network traffic distribution. As a result, the network congestion can be mitigated and the performance of the network is improved.

Realizing the overall resource allocation of the dispersed computing system is a significant challenge. In detail, by jointly managing the task requests of external users and the resource allocation of the internal system to achieve dynamic balance, the efficient and stable operation of the system can be guaranteed. In this paper, we first propose a task-resource joint management model, which quantifies the dynamic transformation relationship between the resources consumed by task requests and the resources occupied by the system in dispersed computing. Secondly, to avoid downtime caused by an overload of resources, we introduce intelligent control into the task-resource joint management model. The existence and stability of the positive periodic solution of the model can be obtained by theoretical analysis, which means that the stable operation of dispersed computing can be guaranteed through the intelligent feedback control strategy. Additionally, to improve the system utilization, the task-resource joint management model with bi-directional intelligent control is further explored. Setting control thresholds for the two resources not only reverse restrains the system resource overload, but also carries out positive incentive control when a large number of idle resources appear. The existence and stability of the positive periodic solution of the model are proved theoretically, that is, the model effectively avoids the two extreme cases and ensure the efficient and stable operation of the system. Finally, numerical simulation verifies the correctness and validity of the theoretical results.","displayPublicationTitle":"China Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/6245522/9597610/09597648.pdf","startPage":"214","endPage":"232","publicationTitle":"China Communications","doi":"10.23919/JCC.2021.10.016","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/JCC.2021.10.016","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9597610","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9597648","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A task-resource joint management model with intelligent control for mission-aware dispersed computing","keywords":[{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["dispersed computing","computing resource management","intelligent control"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9597648/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2021","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 November 2021","displayDocTitle":"A task-resource joint management model with intelligent control for mission-aware dispersed computing","volume":"18","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"01 November 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A task-resource joint management model with intelligent control for mission-aware dispersed computing","sourcePdf":"16.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.01376S","chronDate":"Oct.  2021","isNumber":"9597610","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6245522","articleId":"9597648","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-11-01"},{"_id":9597649,"authors":[{"name":"Yongrui Su","affiliation":["School of Economics and Management, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing 100876, China"],"firstName":"Yongrui","lastName":"Su"},{"name":"Ling Zhao","affiliation":["School of Marxism, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing 100876, China"],"firstName":"Ling","lastName":"Zhao"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1673-5447"}],"articleNumber":"9597649","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"keywords":[{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["information and communications technology(ICT)","consumer choice behavior","rational choice theory","the fifth-Generation mobile communication system(5G)","online education"]}],"abstract":"The application of information and communications technology(ICT) in the education industry is becoming more and more extensive, and online education realized through ICT is developing in full swing.

increasing utilization of lithium-ion batteries, prognostics and health management (PHM) of batteries has become inevitable in energy system studies. Amongst, state-of-health (SOH) analysis introduces several challenges in online applications. In this respect, this paper presents a novel data-driven SOH prediction model based on machine learning methods, namely, feed-forward neural network (FFNN), support vector machine (SVM), and relevance vector machine (RVM). A novel feature extraction technique is employed, and a large dataset including 44 batteries with different cycle patterns is considered to test the accuracy of the proposed method. The results show that the maximum mean-absolute-percentage error (MAPE) of the proposed models for test batteries is 1.95%. The results demonstrate that the accuracy of the proposed method is suitable, and it can be easily implemented in large-scale applications.","doi":"10.1109/AUPEC52110.2021.9597754","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AUPEC52110.2021.9597754","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 31st Australasian Universities Power Engineering Conference (AUPEC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9597674/9597694/09597754.pdf","publicationTitle":"2021 31st Australasian Universities Power Engineering Conference (AUPEC)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9597694","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel data-driven SOH prediction model for lithium-ion batteries","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 Sept. 2021","displayDocTitle":"A novel data-driven SOH prediction model for lithium-ion batteries","conferenceDate":"26-30 Sept. 2021","publicationDate":"26 Sept. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"16 November 2021","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9597754/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9597754/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel data-driven SOH prediction model for lithium-ion batteries","confLoc":"Perth, Australia","sourcePdf":"Paper50_2021213065.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059262S","chronDate":"26-30 Sept. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9597674","isNumber":"9597694","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9597674","xplore-issue":"9597694","articleId":"9597754","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-26"},{"_id":9597758,"authors":[{"name":"Murilo E.

The recent development of Wide-Area Measurement Systems allows data from Phasor Measurement Units (PMUs) to be used to compose a Wide-Area Damping Controller (WADC) and dampen these oscillation modes. However, the vulnerability of PMU data to cyber-attacks that can compromise the stability of the power system makes the implementation of the WADC difficult. This article proposes a WADC resilient design method based on an optimization problem. A metaheuristic called African Vultures Optimization Algorithm will be used to solve the optimization problem. Case studies show the effectiveness of the designed controller in the dynamic performance of the system in continuous operation or under attack in its communication channels.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9597758/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 Sept. 2021","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"26-30 Sept. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9597758/","dateOfInsertion":"16 November 2021","publicationDate":"26 Sept. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Design of a Resilient Wide-Area Damping Controller Using African Vultures Optimization Algorithm","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001807","fundingName":"S\u00e3o Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP)","grantNumber":"2015/24245-8"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002322","fundingName":"Coordena\u00e7\u00e3o de Aperfei\u00e7oamento de Pessoal de N\u00edvel Superior - Brasil (CAPES)","grantNumber":"88887.510888/2020-00"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of a Resilient Wide-Area Damping Controller Using African Vultures Optimization Algorithm","confLoc":"Perth, Australia","sourcePdf":"Paper137_2021213307.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.088254S","chronDate":"26-30 Sept. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9597674","isNumber":"9597694","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9597674","xplore-issue":"9597694","articleId":"9597758","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-26"},{"_id":9597791,"authors":[{"name":"Chirag V.

The oscillatory mode instability occurs in the power system due to various reasons like fast-acting exciters with high gain, heavy power transfer over a weak transmission line, etc. In this paper, static var compensator (SVC) is used to improve the system stability and performance by providing damping to the low-frequency inter-area mode of oscillation. To provide damping effectively to such mode simultaneous tuning of SVC and power system stabilizer (PSS) is mendatory under the different operating conditions of the power system. Moreover, to achieve controllability in the power system, the flexible ac transmission systems (FACTS) device and the PSS should be located optimally. In this paper, a residue-based method has been used to find the optimal location of the SVC controller for damping of the inter-area mode of oscillations and the optimal location of PSS is determined by participation factors. The proposed method is implemented on Four-machine, Ten-bus, Two-area test system. Simulation studies have been carried out in MATLAB/Simulink platform to verify the performance of with and without SVC and PSS for the test systems under three operating conditions, i.e., light loading, nominal loading, heavy loading conditions. In addition to this, eigenvalue analysis and time-domain simulation results are used to evaluate the performance of the system under above three loading conditions. The results confirm that the proposed approach significantly enhances the stability of the inter-area oscillation mode under all loading conditions.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9597694","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AUPEC52110.2021.9597791","publicationTitle":"2021 31st Australasian Universities Power Engineering Conference (AUPEC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 31st Australasian Universities Power Engineering Conference (AUPEC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9597674/9597694/09597791.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doi":"10.1109/AUPEC52110.2021.9597791","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal Placement of SVC using Residue Technique and Coordination with PSS for Damping Inter-Area Oscillations","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 Sept. 2021","displayDocTitle":"Optimal Placement of SVC using Residue Technique and Coordination with PSS for Damping Inter-Area Oscillations","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"26-30 Sept. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9597791/","publicationDate":"26 Sept. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"16 November 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9597791/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal Placement of SVC using Residue Technique and Coordination with PSS for Damping Inter-Area Oscillations","confLoc":"Perth, Australia","sourcePdf":"Paper65_2021166384.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063994S","chronDate":"26-30 Sept. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9597674","isNumber":"9597694","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9597674","xplore-issue":"9597694","articleId":"9597791","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-26"},{"_id":9598176,"authors":[{"name":"Sachin Maheshwari","affiliation":["Centre for Electronics Frontiers, University of Southampton, Southampton, U.K."],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/9629436/9598176/mahes-3122343-small.gif","p":["Sachin Maheshwari (Member, IEEE) received the bachelor\u2019s degree in electrical and electronic engineering from ICFAI University, India, the master\u2019s degree in microelectronics from the Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani, India, and the Ph.D. degree in electronics engineering from the University of Westminster, London, U.K. He is currently a Research Fellow at the Centre of Electronics Frontiers, University of Southampton, U.K. His research interests include energy recovery logic and neural network design with memristive crossbar arrays."]},"firstName":"Sachin","lastName":"Maheshwari","orcid":"0000-0002-9192-2961"},{"name":"Spyros Stathopoulos","affiliation":["Centre for Electronics Frontiers, University of Southampton, Southampton, U.K."],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/9629436/9598176/stath-3122343-small.gif","p":["Spyros Stathopoulos received the Ph.D. degree in applied physics researching on shallow junction engineering in silicon and germanium from the National Technical University of Athens, Greece.

In this work, we demonstrate the behaviour of our in-house fabricated custom memristor model and its integration into the Cadence Electronic Design Automation (EDA) tools for verification. Various input stimuli were given to record the memristive device characteristics both at the device level as well as the schematic level for verification of the memristor model. This design flow from device to industrial level EDA tools is the first step before the model can be used and integrated with Complementary Metal-Oxide Semiconductor (CMOS) in applications for hybrid memristor/CMOS system design.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design Flow for Hybrid CMOS/Memristor Systems\u2014Part I: Modeling and Verification Steps","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2021.3122343","endPage":"4875","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel7/8919/9629436/09598176.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","startPage":"4862","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2021.3122343","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9629436","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9598176","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Memristors","Semiconductor device modeling","Voltage control","Switches","Mathematical models","Integrated circuit modeling","Electrodes"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["EDA tools","hybrid CMOS/memristor","modelling","verification"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Design Flow for Hybrid CMOS/Memristor Systems\u2014Part I: Modeling and Verification Steps","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9598176/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 November 2021","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2021","volume":"68","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/9598176/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"30 November 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000266","fundingName":"EPSRC Programme Grant FORTE","grantNumber":"EP/R024642/1"},{"fundingName":"SYNCH","grantNumber":"H2020-FETPROACT-2018-01"},{"fundingName":"RAEng Chair in Emerging Technologies","grantNumber":"CiET1819/2/93"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design Flow for Hybrid CMOS/Memristor Systems\u2014Part I: Modeling and Verification Steps","sourcePdf":"tcsi-maheshwari-3122343-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.126594S","chronDate":"Dec.  2021","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"9629436","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"9629436","articleId":"9598176","onlineDate":"13 November 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","relatedContent":{"multipart":["10.1109/TCSI.2021.3122381"]},"publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-06"},{"_id":9598180,"authors":[{"name":"Sachin Maheshwari","affiliation":["Centre for Electronics Frontiers, University of Southampton, Southampton, U.K."],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/9629436/9598180/mahes-3122381-small.gif","p":["Sachin Maheshwari (Member, IEEE) received the bachelor\u2019s degree in electrical and electronic engineering from ICFAI University, India, the master\u2019s degree in microelectronics from the Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani, India, and the Ph.D. degree in electronics engineering from the University of Westminster, London, U.K. He is currently a Research Fellow with the Centre of Electronics Frontiers, University of Southampton, U.K. His research interests include energy recovery logic and neural network design with memristive crossbar arrays."]},"firstName":"Sachin","lastName":"Maheshwari","orcid":"0000-0002-9192-2961"},{"name":"Spyros Stathopoulos","affiliation":["Centre for Electronics Frontiers, University of Southampton, Southampton, U.K."],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/9629436/9598180/stath-3122381-small.gif","p":["Spyros Stathopoulos received the Diploma degree in applied physics, the M.Sc. degree in microelectronics and nanodevices, and the Ph.D. degree in applied physics researching on shallow junction engineering in silicon and germanium from the National Technical University of Athens, Athens, Greece.

By employing the presented unified framework, the finite-time and fixed-time synchronization of MCSs can be realized simultaneously. On the one hand, based on the Lyapunov stability and sliding-mode control theories, the finite-/fixed-time synchronization results are obtained. It is proved that the trajectories of error states come near and get to the designed sliding-mode surface, stay on it accordingly and approach the origin in a finite/fixed time. On the other hand, we develop an image encryption algorithm as well as its implementation process to show the application of the synchronization. Finally, the theoretical results and the corresponding image encryption application are carried out by numerical simulations and statistical performances.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9629436","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2021.3121555","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2021.3121555","startPage":"4957","endPage":"4969","pdfPath":"/iel7/8919/9629436/09598183.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9598183","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 November 2021","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9598183/","displayDocTitle":"Finite-/Fixed-Time Synchronization of Memristor Chaotic Systems and Image Encryption Application","volume":"68","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"30 November 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9598183/","isJournal":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"62076229, 62073301, 61963033 and 61876192"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Finite-/Fixed-Time Synchronization of Memristor Chaotic Systems and Image Encryption Application","sourcePdf":"tcsi-wang-3121555-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.168306S","chronDate":"Dec.  2021","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"9629436","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","xplore-issue":"9629436","articleId":"9598183","onlineDate":"13 November 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-01"},{"_id":9598209,"authors":[{"name":"Trang Hoang","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Ho Chi Minh City University of Technology (HCMUT), Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam"],"firstName":"Trang","lastName":"Hoang","id":"38551653200"},{"name":"Thinh Do Quang","affiliation":["Vietnam National University Ho Chi Minh City, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam"],"firstName":"Thinh Do","lastName":"Quang","id":"37089031544"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3379-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3380-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2162-1039"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2162-1020"}],"articleNumber":"9598209","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":10},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Backpropagation","Computer architecture","Feature extraction","Hardware","Convolutional neural networks","Feeds"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["AI","CNN","flower classification","hardware implementation","feed forward","back propagation"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9598209","abstract":"Flower classification becomes more and more important as the medical and industrial world grows.

This study proposes the hardware architecture for CNN which is tested with FPGA. Numbers and type of layers, as well as their properties are also proposed for effective hardware implementation. Math functions that engine the CNN are also well-cared for the smoothness of both feed forward and back propagation processes. Measurements were taken on the proposed CNN; its accuracy and yield were verified. It also appeared that the classification accuracy of the CNN is strongly affected by the training conditions as well as the flower characteristics. This indicates that further image pre-processing can improve the accuracy of the CNN, which can be implemented separately with the CNN or embedded in CNN\u2019s first layers by controlling the weights.","doi":"10.1109/ATC52653.2021.9598209","startPage":"178","endPage":"183","publicationTitle":"2021 International Conference on Advanced Technologies for Communications (ATC)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ATC52653.2021.9598209","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9598172","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 International Conference on Advanced Technologies for Communications (ATC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9598167/9598172/09598209.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Convolutional Neural Network Hardware Implementation for Flower Classification","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9598209/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Convolutional Neural Network Hardware Implementation for Flower Classification","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9598209/","publicationDate":"14 Oct. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2021","conferenceDate":"14-16 Oct. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 Oct. 2021","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Convolutional Neural Network Hardware Implementation for Flower Classification","confLoc":"Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam","sourcePdf":"1570742022.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.123347S","chronDate":"14-16 Oct. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9598167","isNumber":"9598172","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9598167","xplore-issue":"9598172","articleId":"9598209","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-17"},{"_id":9598524,"authors":[{"name":"Jahnavi Jonnalagadda","affiliation":["George Mason University, Fairfax, VA, USA"],"firstName":"Jahnavi","lastName":"Jonnalagadda","id":"37088500900"},{"name":"Mahdi Hashemi","affiliation":["George Mason University, Fairfax, VA, USA"],"firstName":"Mahdi","lastName":"Hashemi","orcid":"0000-0003-0212-0228","id":"37088499303"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3875-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4611-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9598524","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":17},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9598524","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Support vector machines","Social networking (online)","Roads","User-generated content","Information filters","Rough surfaces","Kernel"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Traffic event","Social media","Twitter","Machine learning","Knowledge discovery"]}],"abstract":"Traffic events, such as congestion and accidents, lead to driver frustration, longer travel times, blocked emergency vehicles, and increased fuel consumption. Timely detection of traffic events is necessary for trip planning and restoring smooth operating conditions. Social media platforms allow users to post about their interests and experiences. Traffic is one of the topics for which users generate freely and publicly available content. Thus, extracting and analyzing such user-generated content can yield valuable traffic information. Detecting traffic information from social media data using machine learning, in the literature, is mostly limited to detecting whether or not they contain traffic-related information. This study goes one step further to detect specific traffic-related information from social media, such as accidents, congestion, disabled vehicle, road closure, road hazard, work/construction zone, and traffic condition information. To this aim, by adjusting kernel size and the number of filters, the experimental results showed that, with the proper setting of the kernel size and number filters, convolutional neural network outperforms bidirectional long-short term memory network, multi-layer perceptron, random forest, and support vector machines, in terms of F1 score and generalization accuracy.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9598515","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IRI51335.2021.00007","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 22nd International Conference on Information Reuse and Integration for Data Science (IRI)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 22nd International Conference on Information Reuse and Integration for Data Science (IRI)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9599090/9598515/09598524.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","doi":"10.1109/IRI51335.2021.00007","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Deep Learning-based Traffic Event Detection From Social Media","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 Aug. 2021","displayDocTitle":"A Deep Learning-based Traffic Event Detection From Social Media","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"10-12 Aug. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9598524/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"17 November 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9598524/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Deep Learning-based Traffic Event Detection From Social Media","confLoc":"Las Vegas, NV, USA","sourcePdf":"387500a001.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.102723S","chronDate":"10-12 Aug. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9599090","isNumber":"9598515","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9599090","xplore-issue":"9598515","articleId":"9598524","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-26"},{"_id":9598527,"authors":[{"name":"Haidar Abdulrahman Abbas","affiliation":["University of Sulaimani, Sulaymaniyah, Iraq"],"firstName":"Haidar Abdulrahman","lastName":"Abbas","id":"37089032801"},{"name":"Najmadin Wahid Boskany","affiliation":["University of Sulaimani, Sulaymaniyah, Iraq"],"firstName":"Najmadin Wahid","lastName":"Boskany","id":"37089033736"},{"name":"Kayhan Zrar Ghafoor","affiliation":["Salahaddin University, Knowledge University, Erbil, Iraq"],"firstName":"Kayhan Zrar","lastName":"Ghafoor","id":"37889515100"},{"name":"Danda B.

Wi-Fi fingerprints which is a vector of Received Signal Strength (RSS) values in a specific location are considered a good feature for indoor localization due to their simplicity. However, the existing methods such as decision tree (DT) and Na\u00efve Bayes (NB) techniques have some drawbacks. DT has low efficiency because it uses the Boolean function, and NB provides a low accuracy of prediction for the sparse dataset. In this research, fingerprint referencing with two important methods, Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) machine learning algorithms, are used to enable accurate indoor localization. Furthermore, data normalization is implemented to reduce positioning error by increasing the inconsistency of the RSS values. Further, several experiments have been conducted by using three mobile devices in the area of 280 m\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\nto create our dataset by taking 480 RSS records for both training and testing phases. The results show that the accuracy LSTM algorithm is 0.9 m, whereas the SVM algorithm accuracy is 1.1 m.

LSTM, on the other hand, can store information better thanks to its extra layers that communicate. Thus, the learning process takes place more efficiently.

Hence, the paper describes the collection and preparation of a dataset of contact forces, obtained with a wearable instrumented system, mixed with the information of the robot internal inertial sensor to classify the type of underlying surface of a walking humanoid robot. For this classification, the data are acquired for four different slippery floors at a rate of 100 Hz and it is used as input for a long short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network (RNN).

In many of such systems, multiple sources share a limited network resource and therefore the AoIs defined for the individual sources should be correlated with each other. However, there are not found any results in the literature studying the correlation of two or more AoIs in a status update system with multiple sources. In this work, we consider a multi-source system sharing a common service facility and provide a framework to investigate joint performance of the multiple AoIs. We then apply our framework to a simple pushout server with multiple sources and derive a closed-form expression for the joint Laplace transform of the AoIs in the case with independent M/G inputs. We further show some properties of the correlation coefficient of AoIs in the two-source system.","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2021.3124872","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel7/18/9687099/09598815.pdf","startPage":"965","endPage":"975","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9687099","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2021.3124872","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2022","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 November 2021","displayDocTitle":"Joint Performance Analysis of Ages of Information in a Multi-Source Pushout Server","volume":"68","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/9598815/","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2022","publicationDate":"Feb. 2022","isJournal":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9598815/","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001691","fundingName":"Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research (C)","grantNumber":"19K11838"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint Performance Analysis of Ages of Information in a Multi-Source Pushout Server","sourcePdf":"tit-miyoshi-3124872-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.071035S","chronDate":"Feb.  2022","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"9687099","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","xplore-issue":"9687099","articleId":"9598815","onlineDate":"13 November 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2022","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-25"},{"_id":9598832,"authors":[{"name":"Insha Amin","affiliation":["Indian Institute of Technology Jammu, Jammu & Kashmir, India"],"firstName":"Insha","lastName":"Amin"},{"name":"Deepak Mishra","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Telecommunications, UNSW, Sydney, NSW, Australia"],"firstName":"Deepak","lastName":"Mishra","orcid":"0000-0002-3225-6495"},{"name":"Ravikant Saini","affiliation":["Indian Institute of Technology Jammu, Jammu & Kashmir, India"],"firstName":"Ravikant","lastName":"Saini","orcid":"0000-0001-7879-9754"},{"name":"Sonia A\u00efssa","affiliation":["Institut National de la Recherche Scientifique (INRS), Montreal, Canada"],"firstName":"Sonia","lastName":"A\u00efssa","orcid":"0000-0002-6880-4772"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"9598832","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":73},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["NOMA","Quality of service","Resource management","Relays","Silicon carbide","Jamming","Signal to noise ratio"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["NOMA","untrusted users","secrecy rate","relaying"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9598832","doi":"10.1109/LCOMM.2021.3124902","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCOMM.2021.3124902","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9674048","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/4234/9674048/09598832.pdf","startPage":"31","endPage":"34","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"QoS-Aware Secrecy Rate Maximization in Untrusted NOMA With Trusted Relay","abstract":"This letter considers a trusted decode-and-forward relay-assisted two-user non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) communication system, and tackles the secure rate maximization problem at the near user.

However, the limited battery capacity of the UAV restricts its application on many occasions, e.g., the networks deployed in the wild. In this paper, we propose a cooperative trajectory planning scheme to deal with the energy issue of the UAV, where a truck carrying backup batteries moves along with the UAV acting as a \u201cmobile recharging station\u201d. Our optimization task is to minimize the total mission time for gathering data from all the sensor nodes, which can be achieved by solving two problems: First, we need to divide the entire mission area into multiple subregions so that the UAV can hover over each subregion to collect the data of the sensor nodes through just one taking-off and landing under the constraint of battery capacity; second, we should find out the optimal trajectory of the truck so that the UAV can get to the hovering positions of each subregion from the truck and fly back to it before the battery drains considering the road condition in real world. We introduce an efficient clustering algorithm to partition the area into subregions in a load-balanced way to minimize the number of movements of the UAV. The trajectory planning task is formulated as a coordinated traveling salesman problem, which is solved by a three-step trajectory planning algorithm heuristically, and we also give the analysis of the upper bound and lower bound to demonstrate the performance guarantee. Numerical results show that our proposed scheme provides an effective and cost-efficient way for the data collection of large-scale wireless sensor networks in practical scenarios.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2021.3124950","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/9681827/09598833.pdf","startPage":"433","endPage":"444","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9681827","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2021.3124950","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2022","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 November 2021","displayDocTitle":"Efficient Aerial Data Collection With Cooperative Trajectory Planning for Large-Scale Wireless Sensor Networks","volume":"70","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/9598833/","dateOfInsertion":"14 January 2022","publicationDate":"Jan. 2022","isJournal":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9598833/","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61931023 and U1936202"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient Aerial Data Collection With Cooperative Trajectory Planning for Large-Scale Wireless Sensor Networks","sourcePdf":"tcomm-wang-3124950-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.107188S","chronDate":"Jan.  2022","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"9681827","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","xplore-issue":"9681827","articleId":"9598833","onlineDate":"13 November 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2022","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-23"},{"_id":9598842,"authors":[{"name":"Farzin Salek","affiliation":["F\u00edsica Te\u00f2rica: Informaci\u00f3 i Fen\u00f2mens Qu\u00e0ntics, Universitat Aut\u00f2noma de Barcelona, Bellaterra, Barcelona, Spain","Universitat Polit\u00e8cnica de Catalunya, Barcelona, Spain","Zentrum Mathematik, Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen, M\u00fcnchen, Germany"],"bio":{"p":["Farzin Salek is a Post-Doctoral Researcher at the Department of Mathematics of the Technical University of Munich (TUM), Munich, Germany.

The former task is known as common randomness (CR) distillation, and it requires offsetting the amount of classical communication against the randomness created. We obtain a new lower bound on the \u201cdistillable common randomness,\u201d an operational measure of the total genuine (classical) correlations in a quantum state. Our proof relies on a generalization of communication for omniscience (CO) [Csisz\u00e1r and Narayan, IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory 50:3047-3061, 2004], and our contribution here is a novel simultaneous decoder for the compression of correlated classical sources by random binning with quantum side information at the decoder. For the latter task, we derive two lower bounds on the rate at which Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states can be asymptotically distilled from any given pure state under LOCC. Our approach consists in \u201cmaking coherent\u201d the proposed CR distillation protocols and recycling of resources [Devetak \n<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">et al.</i>\n IEEE Trans.

However, the learning latency increases with the neural network scale due to the limited local computing power and communication bandwidth. To tackle this issue, we introduce model pruning for wireless FL to reduce the neural network scale. Device selection is also considered to further improve the learning performance. By removing the stragglers with low computing power or bad channel condition, the model aggregation loss caused by model pruning can be alleviated and the communication overhead can be effectively reduced. We analyze the convergence rate and learning latency of the proposed model pruning method and formulate an optimization problem to maximize the convergence rate under the given learning latency budget via jointly optimizing the pruning ratio, device selection, and wireless resource allocation. By solving the problem, the closed-form solutions of pruning ratio and wireless resource allocation are derived and the threshold-based device selection strategy is developed. Finally, extensive experiments are carried out to demonstrate that the proposed model pruning algorithm outperforms other existing schemes.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9598845/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 November 2021","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2022","volume":"70","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"14 January 2022","publicationDate":"Jan. 2022","htmlLink":"/document/9598845/","displayDocTitle":"Joint Model Pruning and Device Selection for Communication-Efficient Federated Edge Learning","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100012166","fundingName":"National Key Research and Development Program of China","grantNumber":"2018YFB1802302"},{"fundingName":"Zhejiang Lab\u2019s International Talent Fund for Young Professionals"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint Model Pruning and Device Selection for Communication-Efficient Federated Edge Learning","sourcePdf":"tcomm-yu-3124961-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.111954S","chronDate":"Jan.  2022","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"9681827","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","xplore-issue":"9681827","articleId":"9598845","onlineDate":"13 November 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2022","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-23"},{"_id":9598846,"authors":[{"name":"Zule Xu","affiliation":["Systems Design Lab, School of Engineering, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/92/9627316/9598846/xu-3122027-small.gif","p":["Zule Xu (Member, IEEE) received the B.E. degree in electrical engineering from the Dalian University of Technology, Dalian, China, in 2006, the M.E. degree in electrical communication engineering from Tohoku University, Sendai, Japan, in 2011, and the Ph.D. degree in physical electronics engineering from the Tokyo Institute of Technology, Tokyo, Japan, in 2015.","From 2015 to 2016, he was a Researcher with the Tokyo Institute of Technology.

For higher feasibility and wider input range, a differential architecture is proposed with an inverter-based resistive digital-to-analog converter (RDAC) and a four-input comparator. MOSFET gate capacitance is employed for the sampling capacitor. To mitigate its capacitance variation due to input voltage and the leakage between gate and diffusion, we leave the diffusion of the standard cell floating and only use the capacitance between gate and bulk. Two prototypes have been designed in 65-nm bulk CMOS. Prototype I has been fabricated and achieves 10 MS/s, 14.3 mW, and 28.1-dB SNDR in a 6-bit architecture. The performance is improved in Prototype II by proposing a lookup table (LUT)-compensating transistor-configurable inverter-based RDAC and an OR-AND-Inverter (OAI)-based comparator and by employing a thick-oxide diffusion-floating decoupling cell for the sampling capacitor. The default LUT is created during the design phase by a script-controlled automatic simulation routine. The power consumption is significantly reduced as well through improved timing control. Layout-parasitic-extraction (LPE) simulations of Prototype II suggest 35.7- and 47.2-dB SNDRs in 6- and 8-bit versions, respectively. The power consumptions are reduced to 0.91 and 2.52 mW, respectively.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An All-Standard-Cell-Based Synthesizable SAR ADC With Nonlinearity-Compensated RDAC","doi":"10.1109/TVLSI.2021.3122027","endPage":"2162","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/92/9627316/09598846.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","startPage":"2153","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVLSI.2021.3122027","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9627316","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9598846","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Prototypes","Logic gates","Capacitors","MOSFET","Inverters","Capacitance","Voltage"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Resistive DAC (RDAC)","standard cell","synthesizable","synthesizable successive-approximation-register analog-to-digital converter (SAR ADC)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"An All-Standard-Cell-Based Synthesizable SAR ADC With Nonlinearity-Compensated RDAC","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9598846/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 November 2021","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2021","volume":"29","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/9598846/","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"25 November 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002241","fundingName":"Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST) Adaptable and Seamless Technology Transfer Program through the Target-Driven Research and Development (A-STEP)","grantNumber":"JPMJTR201C"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001691","fundingName":"Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) KAKENHI","grantNumber":"20K14786"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"An All-Standard-Cell-Based Synthesizable SAR ADC With Nonlinearity-Compensated RDAC","sourcePdf":"tvlsi-xu-3122027-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.067071S","chronDate":"Dec.  2021","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"9627316","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","xplore-issue":"9627316","articleId":"9598846","onlineDate":"13 November 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"CCBYNCND","lastupdate":"2021-11-30"},{"_id":9598863,"authors":[{"name":"Xiuhong Wei","affiliation":["Beijing National Research Center for Information Science and Technology (BNRist), Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xiuhong","lastName":"Wei","orcid":"0000-0002-6117-3189"},{"name":"Linglong Dai","affiliation":["Beijing National Research Center for Information Science and Technology (BNRist), Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Linglong","lastName":"Dai","orcid":"0000-0002-4250-7315"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"9598863","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":126},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","Channel models","Transmission line matrix methods","Transforms","Antenna arrays","Sparse matrices","Estimation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Extremely large-scale massive MIMO","hybrid-field channel modeling","channel estimation"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9598863","doi":"10.1109/LCOMM.2021.3124927","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCOMM.2021.3124927","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9674048","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/4234/9674048/09598863.pdf","startPage":"177","endPage":"181","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Channel Estimation for Extremely Large-Scale Massive MIMO: Far-Field, Near-Field, or Hybrid-Field?","abstract":"Extremely large-scale massive MIMO (XL-MIMO) is a promising technique for future 6G communications.

Thus, existing far-field and near-field channel estimation schemes cannot be directly used to accurately estimate the hybrid-field XL-MIMO channel. To solve this problem, we propose an efficient hybrid-field channel estimation scheme by accurately modeling the XL-MIMO channel. Specifically, we firstly reveal the hybrid-field channel feature of the XL-MIMO channel, where different scatters may be in far-field or near-field region. Then, we propose a hybrid-field channel model to capture this feature, which contains both the far-field and near-field path components.

The sensors share orthogonal sub-channels to transmit such information in the form of status update packets. A central controller can control the sampling actions of the sensors to trade-off between the transmit power consumption and information freshness which is quantified by the Age of Information (AoI). We jointly optimize the sampling action of each sensor, the transmit power allocation, and the sub-channel assignment to minimize the average total transmit power of all sensors, subject to a maximum average AoI constraint for each sensor. To solve the problem, we develop a dynamic control algorithm using the Lyapunov drift-plus-penalty method and provide optimality analysis of the algorithm. According to the Lyapunov drift-plus-penalty method, to solve the main problem, we need to solve an optimization problem in each time slot which is a mixed integer non-convex optimization problem.

The objective of the protocol is to utilize minimum resources, in terms of classical bits needed by Alice and Bob to communicate their measurement outcomes to Charlie, and the common randomness shared among the three parties, while faithfully simulating independent repeated instances of the original measurement. To achieve this, we develop a mutual covering lemma and a technique for random binning of distributed quantum measurements, and, in turn, characterize a set of sufficient communication and common randomness rates required for asymptotic simulatability in terms of single-letter quantum information quantities. In the special case, where the Charlie\u2019s action is restricted to a deterministic mapping, we develop a one-shot performance characterization of the distributed faithful simulation problem. Furthermore, using these results we address a distributed quantum rate-distortion problem, where we characterize the achievable rate distortion region through a single-letter inner bound. Finally, via a technique of single-letterization of multi-letter quantum information quantities, we provide an outer bound for the rate-distortion region.","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2021.3124976","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2021.3124976","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9687099","startPage":"1085","endPage":"1118","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel7/18/9687099/09598878.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9598878","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Protocols","Distortion measurement","Rate-distortion","Quantum mechanics","Quantum state","Distortion","Particle measurements"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Quantum measurement","distributed measurements","measurement compression","channel simulation","mutual covering","quantum Shannon theory"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Faithful Simulation of Distributed Quantum Measurements With Applications in Distributed Rate-Distortion Theory","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2022","isJournal":true,"volume":"68","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 2022","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2022","htmlLink":"/document/9598878/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 November 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9598878/","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"NSF","grantNumber":"CCF-1717523 and CCF-2007878"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Faithful Simulation of Distributed Quantum Measurements With Applications in Distributed Rate-Distortion Theory","sourcePdf":"tit-pradhan-3124976-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.175731S","chronDate":"Feb.  2022","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"9687099","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","xplore-issue":"9687099","articleId":"9598878","onlineDate":"13 November 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2022","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-25"},{"_id":9598889,"authors":[{"name":"Sergio Saponara","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Ingegneria dell\u2019Informazione, University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/9312710/9598889/sapon-3124746-small.gif","p":["Sergio Saponara received the Ph.D. degree in electronic engineering from the University of Pisa, Italy.

Deep learning, especially Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) has made a tremendous success in the field of computer vision for pattern recognition. Several approaches have been applied to reconstruct fingerprint images. However, these algorithms encountered problems with various overlapping patterns and poor quality on the images. In this work, a convolutional neural network autoencoder has been used to reconstruct fingerprint images. An autoencoder is a technique, which is able to replicate data in the images. The advantage of convolutional neural networks makes it suitable for feature extraction. Four datasets of fingerprint images have been used to prove the robustness of the proposed architecture. The dataset of fingerprint images has been collected from various real resources. These datasets include a fingerprint verification competition (FVC2004) database, which has been distorted. The proposed approach has been assessed by calculating the cumulative match characteristics (CMC) between the reconstructed and the original features. We obtained promising results of identification rate from four datasets of fingerprints images (Dataset I, Dataset II, Dataset III, Dataset IV) with 98.1%, 97%, 95.9%, and 95.02% respectively by CNN autoencoder. The proposed architecture was tested and compared to the other state-of-the-art methods. The achieved experimental results show that the proposed solution is suitable for recreating a complex context of fingerprinting images.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3124746","startPage":"147888","endPage":"147899","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/9312710/09598889.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3124746","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9312710","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Recreating Fingerprint Images by Convolutional Neural Network Autoencoder Architecture","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fingerprint recognition","Image matching","Deep learning","Convolutional neural networks","Feature extraction","Filtering","Image reconstruction"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Fingerprint images","convolution neural networks","autoencoder","feature extraction","system identification"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9598889/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 November 2021","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","displayDocTitle":"Recreating Fingerprint Images by Convolutional Neural Network Autoencoder Architecture","volume":"9","htmlLink":"/document/9598889/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"2021","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2021","isOpenAccess":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100007514","fundingName":"Ministero Istruzione Universit\u00e0 Ricerca (MIUR)\u2013Dipartimento di Eccellenza Crosslab Project at the University of Pisa"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003971","fundingName":"Abdussalam Elhanashi was supported by Islamic Development Bank for his Ph.D. degree"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Recreating Fingerprint Images by Convolutional Neural Network Autoencoder Architecture","sourcePdf":"access-saponara-3124746-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.10284S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"9312710","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","xplore-issue":"9312710","articleId":"9598889","onlineDate":"02 November 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-11-17"},{"_id":9598892,"authors":[{"name":"Eleni Demarchou","affiliation":["IRIDA Research Centre for Communication Technologies, University of Cyprus, Nicosia, Cyprus"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/9681827/9598892/demar-3124945-small.gif","p":["Eleni Demarchou (Member, IEEE) received the B.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from the University of Cyprus, Cyprus, in 2014, the M.Sc. degree in wireless communications from the University of Southampton, U.K., in 2015, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from the University of Cyprus in 2021.

In this work, we focus on the cross-layer co-design of wireless edge caching schemes with sophisticated physical layer techniques, which facilitate non-orthogonal multiple access and interference mitigation. A flexible caching-aided RS (CRS) technique is proposed that operates in various modes that specify the cache placement at the receivers. We consider two caching policies: the intelligent coded caching (CC), as well as the well-known most popular content (MPC) policy. Both caching policies are integrated within the design parameters of RS in order to serve multiple cache-enabled receivers. The proposed technique is investigated from a system level perspective by taking into account spatial randomness. We consider a single cell network consisting of center and edge receivers and provide a comprehensive analytical framework for the evaluation of the proposed technique in terms of achieved rates. Specifically, we derive the rate achieved at each receiver under minimum rate constraints while incorporating the cache placement characteristics. Numerical results are presented which highlight the flexibility of the proposed technique and show how caching can be exploited in order to further boost the performance of RS.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2021.3124945","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2021.3124945","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9681827","startPage":"664","endPage":"679","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/9681827/09598892.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9598892","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Receivers","NOMA","MISO communication","Transmitters","Interference cancellation","Resource management","Europe"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Wireless edge caching","coded caching","rate splitting","spatial randomness","stochastic geometry"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Rate Splitting With Wireless Edge Caching: A System-Level-Based Co-Design","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2022","isJournal":true,"volume":"70","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2022","dateOfInsertion":"14 January 2022","htmlLink":"/document/9598892/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 November 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9598892/","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100008530","fundingName":"European Regional Development Fund and the Republic of Cyprus through the Research and Innovation Foundation","grantNumber":"INFRASTRUCTURES/1216/0017 (IRIDA)"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000781","fundingName":"European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union\u2019s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme","grantNumber":"819819"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Rate Splitting With Wireless Edge Caching: A System-Level-Based Co-Design","sourcePdf":"tcomm-demarchou-3124945-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.133976S","chronDate":"Jan.  2022","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"9681827","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","xplore-issue":"9681827","articleId":"9598892","onlineDate":"13 November 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2022","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-23"},{"_id":9598898,"authors":[{"name":"Kunzan Liu","affiliation":["Beijing National Research Center for Information Science and Technology (BNRist), Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/9681827/9598898/liu-3124953-small.gif","p":["Kunzan Liu is currently pursuing the B.E. degree with the Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China.

However, due to the constraints of size, cost, and power consumption, it is usually considered unrealistic to use a large-scale antenna array at the user side. Inspired by the emerging technique of reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS), we firstly propose the concept of user-specific RIS (US-RIS) for facilitating the employment of a large-scale antenna array at the user side in a cost- and energy-efficient way. In contrast to the existing employments of RIS, which belong to the family of base-station-specific RISs (BSS-RISs), the US-RIS concept by definition facilitates the employment of RIS at the user side for the first time. This is achieved by conceiving a multi-layer structure to realize a compact form-factor. Furthermore, our theoretical results demonstrate that, in contrast to the existing single-layer structure, where only the phase of the signal reflected from RIS can be adjusted, the amplitude of the signal penetrating multi-layer US-RIS can also be partially controlled, which brings about a new degree of freedom (DoF) for beamformer design that can be beneficially exploited for performance enhancement. In addition, based on the proposed multi-layer US-RIS, we formulate the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) maximization problem of US-RIS-aided communications. Due to the non-convexity of the problem introduced by this multi-layer structure, we propose a multi-layer transmit beamformer design relying on an iterative algorithm for finding the optimal solution by alternately updating each variable. Finally, our simulation results verify the superiority of the proposed multi-layer US-RIS as a compact realization of a large-scale antenna array at the user side for uplink transmission.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2021.3124953","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2021.3124953","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9681827","startPage":"680","endPage":"692","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/9681827/09598898.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9598898","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Costs","Wireless communication","Uplink","Signal to noise ratio","Radio frequency","Phased arrays","Employment"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS)","large-scale antenna arrays","multi-layer structure","transmit beamformer design"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Compact User-Specific Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces for Uplink Transmission","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2022","isJournal":true,"volume":"70","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2022","dateOfInsertion":"14 January 2022","htmlLink":"/document/9598898/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 November 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9598898/","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100012166","fundingName":"National Key Research and Development Program of China","grantNumber":"2020YFB1807201"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"62031019"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000780","fundingName":"European Commission through the H2020-MSCA-ITN META WIRELESS Research Project","grantNumber":"956256"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000266","fundingName":"Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council projects EP/P034284/1 and EP/P003990/1 (COALESCE) as well as of the European Research Council\u2019s Advanced Fellow Grant QuantCom","grantNumber":"789028"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Compact User-Specific Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces for Uplink Transmission","sourcePdf":"tcomm-hanzo-3124953-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.103349S","chronDate":"Jan.  2022","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"9681827","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","xplore-issue":"9681827","articleId":"9598898","onlineDate":"13 November 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2022","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-23"},{"_id":9598911,"authors":[{"name":"Fan Meng","affiliation":["Purple Mountain Laboratories, Nanjing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/9681827/9598911/meng-3124963-small.gif","p":["Fan Meng received the B.S. degree from the School of Electronic Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC), in 2015, and the Ph.D. degree from the School of Information Science and Engineering, Southeast University, China, in 2020.

To tackle this challenge, we propose a learning-aided beam prediction scheme for HSR networks, which predicts the beam directions and the channel amplitudes within a period of future time with fine time granularity, using a group of observations. Concretely, we transform the problem of high-dimensional beam prediction into a two-stage task, i.e., a low-dimensional parameter estimation and a cascaded hybrid beamforming operation. In the first stage, the location and speed of a certain terminal are estimated by maximum likelihood criterion, and a data-driven data fusion module is designed to improve the final estimation accuracy and robustness. Then, the probable future beam directions and channel amplitudes are predicted, based on the HSR scenario priors including deterministic trajectory, motion model, and channel model. Furthermore, we incorporate a learnable non-linear mapping module into the overall beam prediction to allow non-linear tracks. Both of the proposed learnable modules are model-based and have a good interpretability. Compared to the existing beam management scheme, the proposed beam prediction has (near) zero overhead cost and time delay. Simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2021.3124963","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/9681827/09598911.pdf","startPage":"693","endPage":"706","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9681827","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2021.3124963","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2022","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 November 2021","displayDocTitle":"Learning-Aided Beam Prediction in mmWave MU-MIMO Systems for High-Speed Railway","volume":"70","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/9598911/","dateOfInsertion":"14 January 2022","publicationDate":"Jan. 2022","isJournal":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9598911/","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Key R&D Program of China","grantNumber":"2020YFB1806600"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61720106003 and 62001103"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100018615","fundingName":"Research Project of Jiangsu Province","grantNumber":"BE2018121"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Learning-Aided Beam Prediction in mmWave MU-MIMO Systems for High-Speed Railway","sourcePdf":"tcomm-meng-3124963-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.09896S","chronDate":"Jan.  2022","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"9681827","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","xplore-issue":"9681827","articleId":"9598911","onlineDate":"13 November 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2022","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-23"},{"_id":9598912,"authors":[{"name":"Jia Ye","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering, Computer Electrical and Mathematical Sciences and Engineering (CEMSE) Division, King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), Thuwal, Saudi Arabia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/9681827/9598912/ye-3124962-small.gif","p":["Jia Ye (Student Member, IEEE) was born in Chongqing, China.

Moreover, both channel estimation errors and pilot contamination effects caused by re-use of pilot sequences in neighboring cells are taken into consideration in this work.

Furthermore, the obtained exact expressions and deterministic approximations of the ergodic rates are expressed in simplified closed-forms under the special case of multi-keyhole channels to yield useful insights. They reveal that signal-to-noise plus interference ratio (SINR) without user grouping in a multi-keyhole channel is similar to that under standard Rayleigh channel in the asymptotic regime. However, under user grouping, we show that the massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) gains promised by deploying large-scale antenna arrays in multi-cell settings are limited by the number of scatterers even if the number of antennas grows large. Simulation results illustrate the close match provided by the asymptotic analysis for moderate system dimensions and confirm the insights drawn from the theoretical findings.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2021.3124962","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2021.3124962","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9681827","startPage":"332","endPage":"349","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/9681827/09598912.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9598912","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Scattering","MIMO communication","MISO communication","Precoding","Interference","Correlation","Channel models"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Double scattering channel","multiple-input single-output (MISO)","multi-cell systems","maximum ratio transmission (MRT) precoding","minimum-mean-square-error (MMSE) channel estimation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Sum-Rate Analysis of a Multi-Cell Multi-User MISO System Under Double Scattering Channels","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2022","isJournal":true,"volume":"70","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2022","dateOfInsertion":"14 January 2022","htmlLink":"/document/9598912/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 November 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9598912/","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"KAUST Office of Sponsored Research"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sum-Rate Analysis of a Multi-Cell Multi-User MISO System Under Double Scattering Channels","sourcePdf":"tcomm-ye-3124962-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.102238S","chronDate":"Jan.  2022","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"9681827","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","xplore-issue":"9681827","articleId":"9598912","onlineDate":"13 November 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2022","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-23"},{"_id":9598915,"authors":[{"name":"Muntadher Alsabah","affiliation":["The University of Sheffield, Sheffield, U.K."],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/9312710/9598915/alsab-3124812-small.gif","p":["Muntadher Alsabah received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from the University of Baghdad, Iraq, in 2007, the M.S. degree in wireless communication engineering from Universiti Putra Malaysia (UPM), Malaysia, in 2014, and the Ph.D. degree in wireless communication from The University of Sheffield, Sheffield, U.K., in 2020.

However, the rapid growth in the number of smart devices and the emergence of the Internet of Everything (IoE) applications, which require an ultra-reliable and low-latency communication, will result in a substantial burden on the 5G wireless networks. As such, the data rate that could be supplied by 5G networks will unlikely sustain the enormous ongoing data traffic explosion. This has motivated research into continuing to advance the existing wireless networks toward the future generation of cellular systems, known as sixth generation (6G). Therefore, it is essential to provide a prospective vision of the 6G and the key enabling technologies for realizing future networks. To this end, this paper presents a comprehensive review/survey of the future evolution of 6G networks. Specifically, the objective of the paper is to provide a comprehensive review/survey about the key enabling technologies for 6G networks, which include a discussion about the main operation principles of each technology, envisioned potential applications, current state-of-the-art research, and the related technical challenges. Overall, this paper provides useful information for industries and academic researchers and discusses the potentials for opening up new research directions.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9312710","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3124812","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/9312710/09598915.pdf","startPage":"148191","endPage":"148243","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3124812","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"6G Wireless Communications Networks: A Comprehensive Survey","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","displayDocTitle":"6G Wireless Communications Networks: A Comprehensive Survey","volume":"9","htmlLink":"/document/9598915/","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"2021","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9598915/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 November 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"T","title":"6G Wireless Communications Networks: A Comprehensive Survey","sourcePdf":"access-alutaibi-3124812-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.752266S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"9312710","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"9312710","articleId":"9598915","onlineDate":"02 November 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-12-26"},{"_id":9598927,"authors":[{"name":"Yalei Wang","affiliation":["Beijing National Research Center for Information Science and Technology, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/9681827/9598927/wang-3124946-small.gif","p":["Yalei Wang (Graduate Student Member, IEEE) received the B.S. degree from Tsinghua University in 2017, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree with the Department of Electronic Engineering.

In URLLC with random channel gains and a hard delay constraint, the scheduling of backlogged queues and finite blocklength coding in the physical layer will make it very challenging to specify its performance limits. In this paper, we focus our attention on the asymptotic cross-layer analysis of URLLC when the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) is sufficiently high. More specifically, we find that a fundamental tradeoff exists among the service capability, latency, and error probability in the high SNR regime, which is characterized by a gain conservation equation. The main result of this work reveals that the sum of our defined service rate gain, real-time gain, and reliability gain is equal to one under the optimal policy. Numerical simulations are also exploited to validate that the derived gain conservation equation holds even with bounded random arrival.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2021.3124946","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/9681827/09598927.pdf","startPage":"149","endPage":"162","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9681827","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2021.3124946","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2022","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 November 2021","displayDocTitle":"Ultra-Reliable and Low-Latency Wireless Communications in the High SNR Regime: A Cross-Layer Tradeoff","volume":"70","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/9598927/","dateOfInsertion":"14 January 2022","publicationDate":"Jan. 2022","isJournal":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9598927/","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004826","fundingName":"Beijing Natural Science Foundation","grantNumber":"4191001"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61971264"},{"fundingName":"National Key R&D Program of China","grantNumber":"2018YFB1801102"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"U.S. National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"CCF-0939370, CCF-1513915 and CCF-1908308"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ultra-Reliable and Low-Latency Wireless Communications in the High SNR Regime: A Cross-Layer Tradeoff","sourcePdf":"tcomm-chen-3124946-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.102936S","chronDate":"Jan.  2022","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"9681827","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","xplore-issue":"9681827","articleId":"9598927","onlineDate":"13 November 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2022","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-23"},{"_id":9598933,"authors":[{"name":"Mohammad Nassar","affiliation":["Technion\u2013Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, Israel"],"bio":{"p":["Mohammad Nassar (Student Member, IEEE) received the B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees in computer science from the Technion\u2014Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, Israel, in 2018 and 2020, respectively.

In addition, the widespread use of electric vehicles creates the need for optimal locating electric vehicle charging stations in urban areas. In this study, a Genetic Algorithm approach based on graph theory is developed to locate a certain number of charging stations in urban areas. In the proposed method, some points in the urban area are accepted as reference nodes. By considering the path relation and distance information between these reference nodes, the urban area is expressed with a weighted graph. The minimum cost paths between the reference points in the urban area expressed by graph were determined by the Dijkstra method. The obtained minimum cost paths are used in the fitness function of the GA. Then, a GA-based method is developed to distribute the charging stations homogeneously at the urban area. The proposed method is tested on a virtual urban area with 20 reference nodes. The obtained results showed that the proposed method is a suitable method for distance-based charging station location determination.","doi":"10.1109/ASYU52992.2021.9598951","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 Innovations in Intelligent Systems and Applications Conference (ASYU)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9598463/9598942/09598951.pdf","publicationTitle":"2021 Innovations in Intelligent Systems and Applications Conference (ASYU)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASYU52992.2021.9598951","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9598942","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Genetic Algorithm Approach based on Graph Theory for Location Optimization of Electric Vehicle Charging Stations","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Technological innovation","Costs","Urban areas","Internal combustion engines","Charging stations","Electric vehicle charging","Graph theory"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Charging Station","Dijkstra","Electric Vehicle","Genetic Algorithm","Graph Theory"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9598951/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 Oct. 2021","displayDocTitle":"Genetic Algorithm Approach based on Graph Theory for Location Optimization of Electric Vehicle Charging Stations","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9598951/","publicationDate":"6 Oct. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2021","conferenceDate":"6-8 Oct. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Genetic Algorithm Approach based on Graph Theory for Location Optimization of Electric Vehicle Charging Stations","confLoc":"Elazig, Turkey","sourcePdf":"ASYU_2021_paper_108.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053982S","chronDate":"6-8 Oct. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9598463","isNumber":"9598942","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9598463","xplore-issue":"9598942","articleId":"9598951","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-17"},{"_id":9598969,"authors":[{"name":"B\u00fc\u015franur Bahat","affiliation":["Istanbul University-Cerrahpasa, Istanbul, Turkey"],"firstName":"B\u00fc\u015franur","lastName":"Bahat","id":"37089152122"},{"name":"Pelin G\u00f6rgel","affiliation":["Istanbul University-Cerrahpasa, Istanbul, Turkey"],"firstName":"Pelin","lastName":"G\u00f6rgel","id":"38093818000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3405-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3406-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9598969","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":12},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Deep learning","Training","Technological innovation","Lung cancer","Medical treatment","Lung","Transforms"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["CNN deep learning","Gabor filter","lung cancer"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9598969","abstract":"In our study, we present a lung cancer diagnosis system to classify the cancerous and healthy lung images using the latest deep learning techniques.

In this stage, Gabor Filter method was applied with different orientation values to the images. Then the modified images were given to the deep learning architecture. Gabor Filter transform was provided with the orientation values of 60 and 90 separately for comparison. The accuracy value in case the orientation is 60 is 96.48% and the loss rate is 23.69%. On the other hand the accuracy value in case the orientation is 90, is 98.37% and the loss rate is 8.35%.

In order to reduce this rate, automated systems should be activated in fabric quality inspection. In recent years, many studies have been carried for this purpose. With the developing technology, correct fabric defect detection is about 100% success rate.

In autonomous driving and other safety-critical domains, high reliability must be assured. However, failure metrics measuring reliability post deployment can be costly. To explore more efficient ways of assessing reliability, we leverage metamorphic testing where a follow-up test case (TC) can be automatically generated to account for unseen conditions once a source TC is given. We further determine source TCs by investigating various TC prioritization strategies based on risk, fault, similarity, and coverage. Our experiment on a convolutional neural network's image classifications shows that TC priorities determined by code coverage are prominent in exposing reliability issues, combined with the metamorphic TCs generated by semantic input data changes. The results also show that, in order to safely operate the neural networks, reliability engineers shall pay attention to the potential network structural changes and the evolving requirements-level risks.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Measurement","Semantics","Reliability engineering","Software","Software reliability","Reliability","Convolutional neural networks"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Metamorphic testing","test case prioritization","convolutional neural network (CNN)","image classification"]}],"doi":"10.1109/IRI51335.2021.00017","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 22nd International Conference on Information Reuse and Integration for Data Science (IRI)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 22nd International Conference on Information Reuse and Integration for Data Science (IRI)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9599090/9598515/09599118.pdf","startPage":"75","endPage":"82","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9598515","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IRI51335.2021.00017","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reliability of Convolutional Neural Networks: Failure Metrics with Metamorphic Test Cases","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9599118","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Reliability of Convolutional Neural Networks: Failure Metrics with Metamorphic Test Cases","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9599118/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9599118/","conferenceDate":"10-12 Aug. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 Aug. 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reliability of Convolutional Neural Networks: Failure Metrics with Metamorphic Test Cases","confLoc":"Las Vegas, NV, USA","sourcePdf":"387500a075.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.20189S","chronDate":"10-12 Aug. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9599090","isNumber":"9598515","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9599090","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"9598515","articleId":"9599118","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-26"},{"_id":9599144,"authors":[{"name":"Kuo Yang","affiliation":["Lakehead University, Thunder Bay, Canada"],"firstName":"Kuo","lastName":"Yang","id":"37089033374"},{"name":"Emad A.

Methods: We construct the similarity graph using embedded features of the input image (i.e., Non-Demented (ND), Very Mild Demented (VMD), Mild Demented (MD), and Moderated Demented (MDTD)). We experiment and compare different dimension-reduction and clustering algorithms to construct the best similarity graph to capture the similarity between the same class images using the cosine distance as a similarity measure. We utilize the similarity graph to present (sample) the training data to a convolutional neural network (CNN). We use the similarity graph as a regularizer in the loss function of a CNN model to minimize the distance between the input images and their k-nearest neighbours in the similarity graph while minimizing the categorical cross-entropy loss between the training image predictions and the actual image class labels. Results: We conduct a baseline experiment with a standard, none-tuned VGG-19 CNN model with different settings and compare the results to identify the best settings to classify (ND vs VMD vs MD vs MDTD). Conclusion: Our method achieves an adequate performance on the testing dataset (accuracy = 0.71, area under receiver operating characteristics curve = 0.86, F1 measure = 0.71). Significance: The classification results show that utilizing a structural similarity graph with none tuned standard CNN model can achieve adequate prediction accuracy and motivate fine-tuning several pre-trained models for better classification performance.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 Aug. 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9599144/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9599144/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2021","conferenceDate":"10-12 Aug. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Detection of Alzheimer's Disease Using Graph-Regularized Convolutional Neural Network Based on Structural Similarity Learning of Brain Magnetic Resonance Images","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Detection of Alzheimer's Disease Using Graph-Regularized Convolutional Neural Network Based on Structural Similarity Learning of Brain Magnetic Resonance Images","confLoc":"Las Vegas, NV, USA","sourcePdf":"387500a326.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.108939S","chronDate":"10-12 Aug. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9599090","isNumber":"9598515","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9599090","xplore-issue":"9598515","articleId":"9599144","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":9599163,"authors":[{"name":"Shida Zhang","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering Inner Mongolia University, Hohhot, China"],"firstName":"Shida","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37088849487"},{"name":"Jingyu Zhang","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering Inner Mongolia University, Hohhot, China"],"firstName":"Jingyu","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37089034631"},{"name":"Zehua Wang","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering Inner Mongolia University, Hohhot, China"],"firstName":"Zehua","lastName":"Wang","id":"37089031123"},{"name":"Quanhu Li","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering Inner Mongolia University, Hohhot, China"],"firstName":"Quanhu","lastName":"Li","id":"37086406531"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4160-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4161-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9599163","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":6},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Chaotic communication","Simulation","Neural networks","Sociology","Mean square error methods","Predictive models"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["component","Sparrow search algorithm","BP neural network","Tent chaotic mapping","Cauchy mutation","Grinding particle size prediction"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9599163","abstract":"Aiming at the problem that the common material grinding factors in the industry are complex and it is difficult to accurately predict the output particle size, this paper introduces the sparrow search algorithm, and proposes two improved strategies for the sparrow search algorithm.

To improve the energy efficiency and performance of compute-demanding CNN, FPGA-based acceleration appears to be the best solution. In this article, we design and implement a hardware / software accelerator to efficiently accelerate the entificient and reusable FPGA-based accelerator that maximizes the FPGA compute capacity by exploiting the reorganization and parallelism of weights is proposed. The accelerator also supports computation of \n<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$3\\times 3$</tex>\n convolutional layers and MLPs layers without interaction with the CPU. This accelerator is integrated into the tensorflow deep learning framework to provide software programmers with an easy-to-use interface so that they can declare a network definition while taking advantage of an FPGA engine. This system implemented on a Xilinx Zynq SoC using the PYNQ-Z1 platform achieves a frame rate equivalent to 5.91 fps using 16-bit fixed point and an energy efficiency of 186.25x the Intel\u00ae Xeon\u00ae processre CNN on FPGAs. First, we use tiling techniques to partition the input data. Second, we integrate the proposed accelerator into the tensorflow deep learning framework. We are evaluating the proposed hardware/software system and its integration with tensorflow by implementing the Deep Network In Network. The proposed accelerator achieves peak performance of 57.6 GOPS on a Xilinx PYNQ-Z1 FPGA board. End-to-end evaluation shows performance and power savings of up to 105.91x compared to an Intel\u00ae Xeon\u00ae CPU E5-2620 V4 under the working frequency of 200 MHz and a frame rate equivalent to 3.42 fps using 16-bit fixed point.

The majority of existing results focus on the problems with decoupled constraints. Some recent works have studied the problems subject to separable globally coupled constraints. This paper considers the distributed optimization problems with globally coupled constraints over networks without requiring the separability of the globally coupled constraints. This is made possible by the local estimates of the constraint violations. For solving such a problem, we propose a primal-dual algorithm in the augmented Lagrangian framework, combining the average consensus technique.

In particular, we assume all agents have private beliefs for the true prior probability, based on which they perform Bayesian decision making. We focus on the Bayes risk of the fusion agent and counterintuitively find that incorrect beliefs could achieve a smaller risk than that when agents know the true prior. It is of independent interest for sociotechnical system design that the optimal beliefs of local agents resemble human probability reweighting models from cumulative prospect theory. We also consider asymptotic characterization of the optimal beliefs and fusion agent's risk in the number of local agents. We find that the optimal risk of the fusion agent converges to zero exponentially fast as the number of local agents grows. Furthermore, having an identical constant belief is asymptotically optimal in the sense of the risk exponent. For additive Gaussian noise, the optimal belief turns out to be a simple function of only error costs and the risk exponent can be explicitly characterized.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9307529","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2021.3123891","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2021.3123891","startPage":"6221","endPage":"6236","pdfPath":"/iel7/78/9307529/09599462.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9599462","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 November 2021","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9599462/","displayDocTitle":"Decision Making in Star Networks With Incorrect Beliefs","volume":"69","publicationDate":"2021","dateOfInsertion":"02 December 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9599462/","isJournal":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100008982","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"CCF-1717530"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Decision Making in Star Networks With Incorrect Beliefs","sourcePdf":"tsp-seo-3123891-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.095592S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"9307529","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","xplore-issue":"9307529","articleId":"9599462","onlineDate":"13 November 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-03"},{"_id":9599498,"authors":[{"name":"Takayuki Shinohara","affiliation":["Department of Architecture and Building Engineering, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Yokohama, Japan"],"bio":{"p":["Takayuki Shinohara (Member, IEEE) received the B.S. degree in earth science from Tsukuba University, Ibaraki, Japan, in 2013 and the M.E. degree in architecture, in 2015 from the Tokyo Institute of Technology, Yokohama, Japan, where he is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree in engineering with the Department of Architecture and Building Engineering.","In 2015, he joined the Department of Research and Development, PASCO Corp., Tokyo, Japan, as a Software Engineer.

Moreover, not only a deep learning method for airborne 3-D point clouds but also a deep learning method for points and their waveforms observed by full-waveform LiDAR (airborne FW data) was proposed. We need to achieve highly accurate land cover classification by using airborne FW data, but open data often only have airborne 3-D point clouds available. Therefore, to improve the performance of land cover classification when using airborne 3-D point clouds published as open data, it is important to restore waveforms from airborne 3-D point clouds. In this article, we propose a deep learning model to translate an airborne 3-D point cloud to airborne FW data (called a point-to-waveform translation model, point2wave) using a conditional generative adversarial net (cGAN). Our point2wave is a cGAN pipeline consisting of a generator that translates the waveform corresponding to each point from the input airborne 3-D point cloud and discriminators that calculate the distance between the translated waveform and the ground truth waveform. Using a set of point clouds and waveforms dataset, we have experimented to translate points into the waveforms by point2wave. Experimental results showed that point2wave could translate waveforms from the airborne 3-D point cloud and the translated fake waveforms achieved nearly the same land cover classification performance as the real waveforms.","doi":"10.1109/JSTARS.2021.3124610","startPage":"11630","endPage":"11642","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel7/4609443/9314330/09599498.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSTARS.2021.3124610","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9314330","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Point2Wave: 3-D Point Cloud to Waveform Translation Using a Conditional Generative Adversarial Network With Dual Discriminators","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Three-dimensional displays","Laser radar","Atmospheric modeling","Superresolution","Deep learning","Generators","Feature extraction"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Airborne LiDAR","conditional generative adversarial network","deep learning","full waveform LiDAR"]}],"topic":"Towards Deep Learning-based Reconstruction and Interpretation of Real-World Scenes from LiDAR Point Clouds","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9599498/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 November 2021","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","displayDocTitle":"Point2Wave: 3-D Point Cloud to Waveform Translation Using a Conditional Generative Adversarial Network With Dual Discriminators","volume":"14","htmlLink":"/document/9599498/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"2021","dateOfInsertion":"24 November 2021","isOpenAccess":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Tokyo Metropolitan Resilience Project"},{"fundingName":"Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of the Japanese Government"},{"fundingName":"National Research Institute for Earth Science and Disaster Resilience"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Point2Wave: 3-D Point Cloud to Waveform Translation Using a Conditional Generative Adversarial Network With Dual Discriminators","sourcePdf":"jstars-shinohara-3124610-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.120743S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"4609443","isNumber":"9314330","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4609443","xplore-issue":"9314330","topics":["Towards Deep Learning-based Reconstruction and Interpretation of Real-World Scenes from LiDAR Point Clouds"],"articleId":"9599498","onlineDate":"13 November 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":9599509,"authors":[{"name":"Zhiyu Zhu","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, City University of Hong Kong, Kowloon Tong, Hong Kong"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6745852/9318600/9599509/zhu-3124364-small.gif","p":["Zhiyu Zhu (Graduate Student Member, IEEE) received the B.E. and M.E. degrees in mechatronic engineering, both from the Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China, in 2017 and 2019, respectively.

To tackle such a severely ill-posed problem, we propose a physically-interpretable, compact, efficient, and end-to-end learning-based framework, namely AGD-Net. Precisely, by taking advantage of the imaging process, we first formulate the problem explicitly based on the classic gradient descent algorithm. Then, we design a lightweight neural network with a multi-stage architecture to mimic the formed amended gradient descent process, in which efficient convolution and novel spectral zero-mean normalization are proposed to effectively extract spatial-spectral features for regressing an initialization, a basic gradient, and an incremental gradient. Besides, based on the approximate low-rank property of HS images, we propose a novel rank loss to promote the similarity between the global structures of reconstructed and ground-truth HS images, which is optimized with our singular value weighting strategy during training. Moreover, AGD-Net, a single network after one-time training, is flexible to handle the reconstruction with various spectral response functions. Extensive experiments over three commonly-used benchmark datasets demonstrate that AGD-Net can improve the reconstruction quality by more than 1.0 dB on average while saving 67\u00d7 parameters and 32\u00d7 FLOPs, compared with state-of-the-art methods.

In this work, we comprehensively studied the transfer function of this circuit, resulting in a quadratic eigenvalue problem that describes the distribution of poles. The minimal real part of non-zero eigenvalues defines the dominant pole, which in turn dominates the response time. Simulations for multiple linear regression solutions with different datasets evidence that, the computing time does not necessarily increase with problem size. The dominant pole is related to parameters in the circuit, including feedback conductance, and gain bandwidth products of operational amplifiers. By optimizing these parameters synergistically, the dominant pole shifts to higher frequencies and the computing speed is consequently optimized. Our results provide a guideline for design and optimization of in-memory machine learning accelerators with analog memristor arrays. Also, issues including power consumption, impact of noise and variation of sources and memristors are investigated to offer a comprehensive evaluation of the circuit performance.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimization Schemes for In-Memory Linear Regression Circuit With Memristor Arrays","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2021.3122327","endPage":"4909","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel7/8919/9629436/09599582.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","startPage":"4900","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2021.3122327","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9629436","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9599582","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Memristors","Linear regression","Mathematical models","Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","Optimization","Integrated circuit modeling","Computational modeling"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Analog computing","in-memory computing","linear regression","machine learning","memristor"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Optimization Schemes for In-Memory Linear Regression Circuit With Memristor Arrays","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9599582/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 November 2021","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2021","volume":"68","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/9599582/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"30 November 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100012166","fundingName":"National Key Research and Development Program of China","grantNumber":"2020YFB2206001"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)","grantNumber":"62004002 and 92064004"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100013314","fundingName":"111 Project","grantNumber":"B18001"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimization Schemes for In-Memory Linear Regression Circuit With Memristor Arrays","sourcePdf":"tcsi-sun-3122327-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.12197S","chronDate":"Dec.  2021","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"9629436","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","xplore-issue":"9629436","articleId":"9599582","onlineDate":"13 November 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-01"},{"_id":9599587,"authors":[{"name":"Kung-Jeng Wang","affiliation":["National Taiwan University of Science and Technology, Taipei, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/19/9259274/9599587/wang-3124044-small.gif","p":["Kung-Jeng Wang (Member, IEEE) received the Ph.D. degree in industrial engineering from the University of Wisconsin at Madison, Madison, WI, USA, in 1997.","He is currently a Professor with the Department of Industrial Management, National Taiwan University of Science and Technology, Taipei, Taiwan.

As a result, human is more adaptive and sometimes unreplaceable by machines in complex assembly. However, with the increasing complexity of tasks, product quality has become highly susceptible to human error due to increments in operators\u2019 cognitive load. One of the errors that affect assembly quality is the operator\u2019s use of a handheld tool with an unfavorable working angle when handling the workpiece. In this case, an assistive mechanism to remind workers about the wrong working angle is necessary to support the process. To this end, this study proposes an angle monitoring system to inspect the working angle of handheld tools and provide feedback in real time with minimal interruption to the assembly process. The proposed system consists of an angle measurement model and an action recognition model, which are both built using deep-learning-based object detection algorithm. Besides, the system was designed with flexibility that it is applicable to different tools and assembly tasks. A case study on fastening a high-end graphical processing unit card is investigated to evaluate their performance. Results show 95.83% and 99.83% accuracies of the models. In practice, the proposed study is expected to facilitate assembly quality by preventing the failure of angle-related operations in a timely and reliable manner.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Monitoring","Tools","Task analysis","Three-dimensional displays","Object detection","Production","Location awareness"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Action recognition","angle measurement","deep learning","operator advice system","task monitoring"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TIM.2021.3124044","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","pdfPath":"/iel7/19/9259274/09599587.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"14","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9259274","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIM.2021.3124044","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Smart Operator Assistance System Using Deep Learning for Angle Measurement","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9599587","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Smart Operator Assistance System Using Deep Learning for Angle Measurement","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9599587/","volume":"70","externalId":"5019014","publicationDate":"2021","htmlLink":"/document/9599587/","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"13 November 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 November 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Smart Operator Assistance System Using Deep Learning for Angle Measurement","sourcePdf":"tim-wang-3124044-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.111749S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"19","isNumber":"9259274","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"19","xplore-issue":"9259274","articleId":"9599587","onlineDate":"03 November 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-26"},{"_id":9599632,"authors":[{"name":"Guangyue Han","affiliation":["The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"bio":{"p":["Guangyue Han (Senior Member, IEEE) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in mathematics from Peking University, China, in 1997 and 2000, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in mathematics from the University of Notre Dame, USA, in 2004.

However, mission-critical applications impose stringent quality of service (QoS) requirements that entail ultra-reliability low-latency communications (URLLC). The primary feature of URLLC is that the blocklength of channel codes is short, and the conventional Shannon\u2019s Capacity is not applicable. In this paper, we consider the URLLC in a factory automation (FA) scenario. Due to densely deployed equipment in FA, wireless signal are easily blocked by the obstacles. To address this issue, we propose to deploy intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) to create an alternative transmission link, which can enhance the transmission reliability. In this paper, we focus on the performance analysis for IRS-aided URLLC-enabled communications in a FA scenario. Both the average data rate (ADR) and the average decoding error probability (ADEP) are derived under finite channel blocklength for seven cases: 1) Rayleigh fading channel; 2) With direct channel link; 3) Nakagami-m fading channel; 4) Imperfect phase alignment; 5) Multiple-IRS case; 6) Rician fading channel; 7) Correlated channels. Extensive numerical results are provided to verify the accuracy of our derived results.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2021.3125057","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2021.3125057","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9681827","startPage":"707","endPage":"723","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/9681827/09599656.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9599656","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decoding","Error probability","Ultra reliable low latency communication","Signal to noise ratio","Wireless communication","Production facilities","Performance analysis"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS)","reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)","URLLC","short-packet transmission"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Intelligent Reflecting Surface-Aided URLLC in a Factory Automation Scenario","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2022","isJournal":true,"volume":"70","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2022","dateOfInsertion":"14 January 2022","htmlLink":"/document/9599656/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 November 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9599656/","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Key Research and Development Project","grantNumber":"2019YFE0123600"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"62101128"},{"fundingName":"Basic Research Project of Jiangsu Provincial Department of Science and Technology","grantNumber":"BK20210205"},{"fundingName":"High Level Personal Project of Jiangsu Province","grantNumber":"JSSCBS20210105"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100015013","fundingName":"Research Fund of National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University","grantNumber":"2018A01"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Intelligent Reflecting Surface-Aided URLLC in a Factory Automation Scenario","sourcePdf":"tcomm-pan-3125057-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.134399S","chronDate":"Jan.  2022","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"9681827","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","xplore-issue":"9681827","articleId":"9599656","onlineDate":"13 November 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2022","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-23"},{"_id":9599670,"authors":[{"name":"Yong Gao","affiliation":["Ocean University of China, Qingdao, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/9312710/9599670/gao-3125138-small.gif","p":["Yong Gao was born in Ulanqab, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, China, in 1991.

It is still a major challenge to achieve miniaturization and enhance the maneuverability and underwater reliability of trans-domain UAVs. In this paper, a novel bullet shape Trans-Domain Amphibious Vehicle (TDAV) is proposed which achieves free trans-domain motion and has the advantages of small size, high maneuverability and high reliability for both rotary-wing UAV and Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) operation. Compared with traditional amphibious machines, the TDAV design is streamlined and thus inherits the advantages of both the Bamboo Dragonfly and underwater AUVs. The proposed TDAV has a coaxial counter-propeller-tilting platform which satisfies the power and small diameter fuselage requirements, and the blades fold to reduce underwater drag and facilitate transportation. Further, a stable and efficient trans-domain attitude adjustment system is presented which effectively realizes trans-domain attitude switching. Based on the characteristics of the symmetric TDAV body, a rudder blade allocation algorithm is proposed to realize free movement in water. Finally, an improved particle swarm optimization algorithm is used to obtain suitable hierarchical fractional-order PID parameters. Both simulation and outdoor tests were performed and the results demonstrate that the proposed TDAV achieves outstanding performance in terms of lift altitude, trans-domain attitude switching time, and free trans-domain movement in both water and air.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3125138","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3125138","startPage":"149433","endPage":"149446","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/9312710/09599670.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9312710","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Trans-Domain Amphibious Unmanned Platform Based on Coaxial Counter-Propellers: Design and Experimental Validation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 November 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","displayDocTitle":"Trans-Domain Amphibious Unmanned Platform Based on Coaxial Counter-Propellers: Design and Experimental Validation","publicationDate":"2021","dateOfInsertion":"13 November 2021","volume":"9","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9599670/","isOpenAccess":true,"accessionNumber":"21257717","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9599670/","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100015047","fundingName":"Marine S and T Fund of Shandong Province for the Pilot National Laboratory for Marine Science and Technology, Qingdao","grantNumber":"2018SDKJ0210"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61701462 and 41527901"},{"fundingName":"Equipment for the Pre-research Field Fund Project","grantNumber":"61404160502"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100016083","fundingName":"Scientific Research Startup Foundation of Taishan University","grantNumber":"Y-01-2020016"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100012226","fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"201713018"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Trans-Domain Amphibious Unmanned Platform Based on Coaxial Counter-Propellers: Design and Experimental Validation","sourcePdf":"access-g-3125138-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.174725S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"9312710","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"9312710","articleId":"9599670","onlineDate":"05 November 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-12-27"},{"_id":9599671,"authors":[{"name":"Wided Belloumi","affiliation":["Laboratoire Amp\u00e8re, Ecole Centrale de Lyon, Ecully, France","LATIS\u2014Laboratory of Advanced Technology and Intelligent Systems, Ecole Nationale d\u2019Ing\u00e9nieurs de Sousse, Universit\u00e9 of Sousse, Sousse, Tunisia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/9312710/9599671/bello-3124935-small.gif","p":["Wided Belloumi received the B.S. degree in electronics engineering and the M.S. degree in intelligent and communicating systems from the National Engineering School of Sousse, University of Sousse, Tunisia, in 2015 and 2016, respectively.

As an advanced cyber-physical system, UAVs are exposed to a wide range of cyberattacks. This paper first surveys existing literature for different cyberattacks. Then, we classify these attacks based on their attack entry points, which can be radio channels, messages or on-board systems. There are six classes of UAV cyberattacks, namely channel jamming, message interception, message deletion, message injection, message spoofing and on-board system attack. In the existing literature, there is no survey focusing on UAV cyberattack countermeasures. To close this gap, we survey existing countermeasures for the six attack classes. A comprehensive review of countermeasures is important because countermeasure may not be exclusive to an attack. Knowing a wide range of existing countermeasures can prepare us against existing and new cyberattacks. We classify countermeasure into three classes, namely prevention, detection and mitigation. Prevention countermeasures stop a cyberattack from starting. When prevention countermeasures fail, detection countermeasures alert UAV operator of an attack. After detecting an attack, mitigation countermeasures limits the damage. Following the survey, we further discuss the open challenges in developing countermeasures and propose some potential future research works.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9599697/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 November 2021","volume":"9","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"2021","htmlLink":"/document/9599697/","dateOfInsertion":"09 November 2021","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A Survey of Cyberattack Countermeasures for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles","openAccessFlag":"T","title":"A Survey of Cyberattack Countermeasures for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles","sourcePdf":"access-kong-3124996-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.232654S","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"9312710","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","xplore-issue":"9312710","articleId":"9599697","onlineDate":"03 November 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-11-10"},{"_id":9599698,"authors":[{"name":"Jun-Yong Jang","affiliation":["Convergence Engineering for Intelligent Drone, Sejong University, Seoul, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/9312710/9599698/jang-3125002-small.gif","p":["Jun-Yong Jang received the B.S. degree from the Department of Information and Communication Engineering, Sejong University, Seoul, South Korea, in 2020, where he is currently pursuing the M.S. degree with the Department of Information and Communication Engineering, and Convergence Engineering for Intelligent Drone.

Recently, as the demanded data rates increase, the massive multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) system has drawn attention in wireless communication. In massive MIMO, the implementation of traditional detectors for high reliability has become impractical, and the reduction for the complexity of detectors has emerged as a practical implementation challenge. The existing DL-based detection technique of orthogonal approximate message passing network (OAMPNet) can provide high detection performance. However, the computational complexity is too high for the implementation in massive MIMO systems. The proposed detection technique uses SOR algorithm to reduce the computational complexity, and the relaxation parameter of SOR is adaptively determined by a learning algorithm. A non-linear estimator using the DL algorithm is combined with the SOR algorithm to achieve high reliability, and regardless of the size of the MIMO system, only the size of the DL architecture determines the complexity of the non-linear estimator. Simulation results show that the proposed detector outperforms the conventional linear detector based on minimum mean square error (MMSE) and achieves high reliability with lower complexity than OAMPNet in various channel environments with spatial correlation.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9599698/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 November 2021","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"volume":"9","htmlLink":"/document/9599698/","publicationDate":"2021","dateOfInsertion":"13 November 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Combined Deep Learning and SOR Detection Technique for High Reliability in Massive MIMO Systems","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Information and Communications Technology (ICT) Research and Development Program of the Ministry of Science and ICT (MSIT)/Information and Communications Technology Promotion (IITP) through the Research on Core Technology of Autonomous Twins for Metaverse","grantNumber":"IITP-2021-0-01816"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003725","fundingName":"Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF)"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100010002","fundingName":"Ministry of Education","grantNumber":"2020R1A6A1A03038540"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Combined Deep Learning and SOR Detection Technique for High Reliability in Massive MIMO Systems","sourcePdf":"access-song-3125002-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.090501S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"9312710","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","xplore-issue":"9312710","articleId":"9599698","onlineDate":"03 November 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-11-17"},{"_id":9599715,"authors":[{"name":"Bin Chen","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Information Engineering, Hefei University of Technology, Hefei, China"],"firstName":"Bin","lastName":"Chen","orcid":"0000-0003-3503-2291","id":"37085459888"},{"name":"Wei Ling","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Information Engineering, Hefei University of Technology, Hefei, China"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Ling","id":"37089000193"},{"name":"Yunus Can G\u00fcltekin","affiliation":["Eindhoven University of Technology, MB Eindhoven, The Netherlands"],"firstName":"Yunus Can","lastName":"G\u00fcltekin","orcid":"0000-0002-8551-2851","id":"37086337216"},{"name":"Yi Lei","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Information Engineering, Hefei University of Technology, Hefei, China"],"firstName":"Yi","lastName":"Lei","orcid":"0000-0002-6120-3464","id":"37085865814"},{"name":"Chigo Okonkwo","affiliation":["Eindhoven University of Technology, MB Eindhoven, The Netherlands"],"firstName":"Chigo","lastName":"Okonkwo","orcid":"0000-0002-5716-6728","id":"37398748500"},{"name":"Alex Alvarado","affiliation":["Eindhoven University of Technology, MB Eindhoven, The Netherlands"],"firstName":"Alex","lastName":"Alvarado","orcid":"0000-0002-2172-3051","id":"37294736300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1041-1135"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0174"}],"articleNumber":"9599715","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":92},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Photonics Society","url":"http://www.PhotonicsSociety.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Modulation","Table lookup","Standards","Quadrature amplitude modulation","Computer architecture","Channel coding","Signal to noise ratio"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Achievable information rates","multidimensional (MD) modulation","optical fiber communication"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9599715","abstract":"Signal shaping is vital to approach Shannon\u2019s capacity, yet it is challenging to implement at very high speeds. For example, probabilistic shaping often requires arithmetic coding to realize the target distribution. Geometric shaping requires look-up tables to store the constellation points.

The proposed architecture can generate in real time geometrically shaped 4D formats via simple logic circuit operations and two conventional quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) modulators. This letter describes the 4D-AC used in generating approximated versions of two recently proposed 4D orthant symmetric modulation formats with spectral efficiencies of 6 bit/4D-sym and 7 bit/4D-sym, respectively. Numerical results show losses below 0.05 dB when compared against the baseline formats.","doi":"10.1109/LPT.2021.3125017","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LPT.2021.3125017","startPage":"1419","endPage":"1422","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Technology Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/68/9592523/09599715.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Technology Letters","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9592523","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low-Complexity Geometrical Shaping for 4D Modulation Formats via Amplitude Coding","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 November 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.15, 15 2021","displayDocTitle":"Low-Complexity Geometrical Shaping for 4D Modulation Formats via Amplitude Coding","publicationDate":"15 Dec.15, 2021","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2021","volume":"33","issue":"24","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9599715/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9599715/","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)","grantNumber":"62171175 and 62001151"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100012226","fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"JZ2020HGTB0015"},{"fundingName":"Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO) through the VIDI Grant ICONIC","grantNumber":"15685"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low-Complexity Geometrical Shaping for 4D Modulation Formats via Amplitude Coding","sourcePdf":"lpt-chen-3125017-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.06464S","chronDate":"Dec.15, 15 2021","xplore-pub-id":"68","isNumber":"9592523","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"68","xplore-issue":"9592523","articleId":"9599715","onlineDate":"03 November 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-26"},{"_id":9599861,"authors":[{"name":"Topi Lepp\u00e4nen","affiliation":["Tampere University, Tampere, Finland"],"firstName":"Topi","lastName":"Lepp\u00e4nen","id":"37088528521"},{"name":"Panagiotis Mousouliotis","affiliation":["University of the Peloponnese, Patras, Greece"],"firstName":"Panagiotis","lastName":"Mousouliotis","id":"37085718291"},{"name":"Georgios Keramidas","affiliation":["University of the Peloponnese, Patras, Greece"],"firstName":"Georgios","lastName":"Keramidas","id":"37564401700"},{"name":"Joonas Multanen","affiliation":["Tampere University, Tampere, Finland"],"firstName":"Joonas","lastName":"Multanen","id":"37085655749"},{"name":"Pekka J\u00e4\u00e4skel\u00e4inen","affiliation":["Tampere University, Tampere, Finland"],"firstName":"Pekka","lastName":"J\u00e4\u00e4skel\u00e4inen","id":"37298508200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-0712-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-0713-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9599861","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":20},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Design methodology","Conferences","Collaboration","Life estimation","Programming","System-on-chip","Object recognition"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["heterogeneous computing","hardware integration","hardware acceleration","FPGA","OpenCL"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9599861","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Unified OpenCL Integration Methodology for FPGA Designs","doi":"10.1109/NorCAS53631.2021.9599861","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE Nordic Circuits and Systems Conference (NorCAS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE Nordic Circuits and Systems Conference (NorCAS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9599834/9599641/09599861.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9599641","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NorCAS53631.2021.9599861","abstract":"OpenCL is a widely adopted open standard for general purpose programming of diverse heterogeneous parallel platforms that can harness various device types such as CPUs, DSPs, GPUs, FPGAs and hardware accelerators. It is an extensive and explicit low level API serving well as a platform portability layer. However, using OpenCL for diverse heterogeneous programming in multi-vendor platforms is not practical due to device vendors each providing their own OpenCL implementations which do not interoperate efficiently, leading to inefficient execution coordination and collaborative execution between various device types from different vendors. To this end, this paper proposes a vendor-independent open source method for integration of custom FPGA components to a common OpenCL platform. The method relies on a streamlined memory-mapped hardware control interface implemented by the integrated components. The required OpenCL driver integration is then automatically provided, enabling easy inclusion of different types of FPGA accelerators to the control of a single OpenCL runtime. The ease of integration and portability is demonstrated by integrating two hardware devices in two different FPGA devices. The resource overhead of the hardware interface is shown to be negligible and the clock frequency overheads small enough to not pose efficiency challenges.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9599861/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-27 Oct. 2021","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"16 November 2021","publicationDate":"26 Oct. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9599861/","conferenceDate":"26-27 Oct. 2021","displayDocTitle":"Unified OpenCL Integration Methodology for FPGA Designs","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100011688","fundingName":"ECSEL Joint Undertaking","grantNumber":"783162"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Unified OpenCL Integration Methodology for FPGA Designs","confLoc":"Oslo, Norway","sourcePdf":"Leppanen-Unified-2021195358.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065264S","chronDate":"26-27 Oct. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9599834","isNumber":"9599641","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9599834","xplore-issue":"9599641","articleId":"9599861","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2022-01-23"},{"_id":9599985,"authors":[{"name":"Bousarhane Btissam","affiliation":["Smart Systems Laboratory (SSL), National School of Computer Science and Systems Analysis ENSIAS, Mohammed V University, Rabat, Morocco"],"firstName":"Bousarhane","lastName":"Btissam","id":"37089153150"},{"name":"Bouzidi Driss","affiliation":["Smart Systems Laboratory (SSL), National School of Computer Science and Systems Analysis ENSIAS, Mohammed V University, Rabat, Morocco"],"firstName":"Bouzidi","lastName":"Driss","id":"37089155074"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-952-69244-6-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-2093-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9599985","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Deep learning","Training","Technological innovation","Computational modeling","Roads","Neural networks","Real-time systems"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9599985","abstract":"Road signs recognition plays an important role in improving traffic safety for both drivers and pedestrians. To ensure this recognition, many approaches are proposed by researchers. To overcome the limitations of the existing methods, Deep Learning approaches are used. This type of approaches achieves high recognition performances, and is also less sensitive to real world adverse conditions. However, they are in contrast very computationally expensive due essentially to three main factors, which are more precisely, the size of input images, the type of used layers, and the number of used parameters. From this perspective, the objective of this work is to adopt an approach that aims to reduce this computational complexity, in order to ensure a fast and efficient classification of traffic signs, especially for low and limited resources environments. The adopted approach reaches good classification accuracies, and that by using BTSCD dataset.","doi":"10.23919/FRUCT53335.2021.9599985","startPage":"16","endPage":"23","publicationTitle":"2021 30th Conference of Open Innovations Association FRUCT","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/FRUCT53335.2021.9599985","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9599957","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 30th Conference of Open Innovations Association FRUCT","pdfPath":"/iel7/9599956/9599957/09599985.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Partially Connected Neural Networks for an Efficient Classification of Traffic Signs","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9599985/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Partially Connected Neural Networks for an Efficient Classification of Traffic Signs","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9599985/","publicationDate":"27 Oct. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"19 November 2021","conferenceDate":"27-29 Oct. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 Oct. 2021","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Partially Connected Neural Networks for an Efficient Classification of Traffic Signs","confLoc":"Oulu, Finland","sourcePdf":"Bti.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066904S","chronDate":"27-29 Oct. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9599956","isNumber":"9599957","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9599956","xplore-issue":"9599957","articleId":"9599985","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"}]
