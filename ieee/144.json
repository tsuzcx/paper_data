After patterning and contacting the films, the elements have been assembled in a closed cryostat for operation in a liquid nitrogen bath. The FCL model was successfully tested using prospective fault currents from 25 kA to 150 kA. The electric data show a peak current of 2.7 kA within 1 ms and a limitation to approximately nominal current within 5 ms. Due to this fast response of the YBCO switching elements, FCL coupled grids can be instantaneously decoupled during a fault, leaving the faultless part of the grid practically unimpaired.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Applied Superconductivity","pdfPath":"/iel5/77/31007/01440047.pdf","startPage":"1986","endPage":"1989","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Applied Superconductivity","doi":"10.1109/TASC.2005.849433","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TASC.2005.849433","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31007","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1440047","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Test of a 1 kA superconducting fault current limiter for DC applications","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Testing","Fault current limiters","Yttrium barium copper oxide","Superconducting transmission lines","Low voltage","Superconducting thin films","Superconducting films","Critical current density","Assembly","Nitrogen"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["superconducting device testing","superconducting thin films","fault current limiters","high-temperature superconductors","short-circuit currents"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["superconducting fault current limiter","short circuit current","standalone power systems","superconductivity","YBCO thin films","switching elements","reactive thermal coevaporation","critical current densities","closed cryostat","liquid nitrogen bath","1 kA","25 to 150 kA"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Fault current limiter","short circuit current","stand-alone power systems","superconductivity","YBCO thin films"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1440047/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 2005","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 June 2005","displayDocTitle":"Test of a 1 kA superconducting fault current limiter for DC applications","volume":"15","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/1440047/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2005","accessionNumber":"8485052","dateOfInsertion":"13 June 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Test of a 1 kA superconducting fault current limiter for DC applications","sourcePdf":"01440047.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.100158S","chronDate":"June 2005","xplore-pub-id":"77","isNumber":"31007","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"77","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"31007","articleId":"1440047","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1440077,"authors":[{"name":"H.

The possibility of designing high power density superconducting motors operating at reasonable temperatures allows for new applications in mobile systems in which size and weight represent key design parameters. Thus, all-electric aircrafts represent a promising application for HTS motors. The design of such a complex system as an aircraft consists of a multi-variable optimization that requires computer models and advanced design procedures. This paper presents a specific sizing model of superconducting propulsion motors to be used in aircraft design. The model also takes into account the cooling system. The requirements for this application are presented in terms of power and dynamics as well as a load profile corresponding to a typical mission. We discuss the design implications of using a superconducting motor on an aircraft as well as the integration of the electrical propulsion in the aircraft, and the scaling laws derived from physics-based modeling of HTS motors.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Applied Superconductivity","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Applied Superconductivity","pdfPath":"/iel5/77/31007/01440105.pdf","startPage":"2218","endPage":"2221","doi":"10.1109/TASC.2005.849616","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TASC.2005.849616","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31007","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"HTS motors in aircraft propulsion: design considerations","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1440105/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 June 2005","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 2005","displayDocTitle":"HTS motors in aircraft propulsion: design considerations","htmlLink":"/document/1440105/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2005","dateOfInsertion":"13 June 2005","accessionNumber":"8469149","isJournal":true,"volume":"15","issue":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"HTS motors in aircraft propulsion: design considerations","sourcePdf":"01440105.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.031475S","chronDate":"June 2005","xplore-pub-id":"77","isNumber":"31007","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"77","citationCount":"45","xplore-issue":"31007","articleId":"1440105","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1440107,"authors":[{"name":"P.J.

A particular initiative involves development of an all-electric aircraft requiring significant improvements in certain technologies. NASA has started a new project with one of the objectives being the development of enabling technologies for an all-electric aircraft. Electrical aeropropulsion requires the design of more compact and efficient electrical motors. In order to increase the power density, the weight/size must be minimized and the air gap flux density must increase significantly: the use of superconducting materials is an obvious choice. Existing HTS motors are proof-of-principle demonstrators and exhibit power densities lower than 1 HP/lb, which is too low to be considered in mobile systems. This paper deals with a preliminary electromagnetic design of a 200 HP high temperature superconducting motor optimized in terms of power density. The presented configuration is a synchronous motor with a nonconventional topology enhanced by HTS bulk material. The design targets the Cessna 172 propulsion requirements that are 200 HP at 2700 RPM.","doi":"10.1109/TASC.2005.849618","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Applied Superconductivity","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Applied Superconductivity","pdfPath":"/iel5/77/31007/01440107.pdf","startPage":"2226","endPage":"2229","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31007","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TASC.2005.849618","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High power density superconducting motor for all-electric aircraft propulsion","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1440107","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 2005","displayDocTitle":"High power density superconducting motor for all-electric aircraft propulsion","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1440107/","publicationDate":"June 2005","dateOfInsertion":"13 June 2005","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"8485102","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1440107/","volume":"15","issue":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 June 2005","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High power density superconducting motor for all-electric aircraft propulsion","sourcePdf":"01440107.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036584S","chronDate":"June 2005","xplore-pub-id":"77","isNumber":"31007","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"77","citationCount":"66","xplore-issue":"31007","articleId":"1440107","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":1440126,"authors":[{"name":"L.

This paper presents and compares three kinds of equalizers: linear equalizer, decision feedback equalizer (DFE), and a nonlinear finite-impulse-response DFE (NL-FIR-DFE) based on the analysis of nonlinear operations of direct modulation and detection in MMF links. Computer simulations reveal that NL-FIR-DFE exhibits superior performance in comparison with normal DFE. The equalization performance for an MMF channel with bandwidth 500 MHz-km as well as 160 MHz-km is demonstrated. It is demonstrated that with direct modulation of cost-effective vertical-cavity surface-emitting laser (VCSEL) or Fabry-Perot laser, the transmission distance for installed MMF with a bandwidth of 500 MHz-km at 10 Gb/s can be extended to 300 m with an appropriate offset restricted mode launch condition by utilizing normal DFE and to more than 650 m for NL-FIR-DFE. Moreover, it is shown that the transmission distance for an MMF with a bandwidth of 160 MHz-km can reach 300 m with more than seven times bandwidth improvement by using NL-FIR-DFE.","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2005.849920","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/50/31009/01440506.pdf","startPage":"2001","endPage":"2011","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2005.849920","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31009","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the performance of the electrical equalization technique in MMF links for 10-gigabit ethernet","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1440506","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 June 2005","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1440506/","displayDocTitle":"On the performance of the electrical equalization technique in MMF links for 10-gigabit ethernet","volume":"23","issue":"6","publicationDate":"June 2005","accessionNumber":"8458226","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1440506/","dateOfInsertion":"13 June 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the performance of the electrical equalization technique in MMF links for 10-gigabit ethernet","sourcePdf":"01440506.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.124315S","chronDate":"June 2005","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"31009","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"31009","articleId":"1440506","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":1440507,"authors":[{"name":"M.

An OWC link could be a segment within a metropolitan area network (MAN) or a ground-station-to-space link of a satellite communication system. In these cases, a WDM transmitter and receiver are housed in one transceiver unit with parallel, or near-parallel, optic axes. The crosstalk at the receiver is caused by light from the transmitted signal of the same transceiver, which has been backscattered by molecules and aerosols in the atmosphere. This is exacerbated in the presence of fog and haze, in which case both the desired signal from another transceiver is attenuated by scattering and the backscatter-induced crosstalk increases. A bit-error-rate (BER) model is derived that takes into consideration the dominant noise sources, including backscatter-induced crosstalk and signal mixing with amplified stimulated emission (ASE) from an optical preamplifier at the receiver. The numerical calculations in this paper indicate that, in moderate fog, the BER may increase by an order of magnitude or more due to backscatter, depending upon the atmospheric extinction coefficient.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Backscattering-induced crosstalk in WDM optical wireless communication","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2005.849875","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/50/31009/01440508.pdf","startPage":"2023","endPage":"2030","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2005.849875","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31009","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1440508","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1440508/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 June 2005","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 2005","displayDocTitle":"Backscattering-induced crosstalk in WDM optical wireless communication","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"23","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/1440508/","dateOfInsertion":"13 June 2005","publicationDate":"June 2005","accessionNumber":"8448459","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Backscattering-induced crosstalk in WDM optical wireless communication","sourcePdf":"01440508.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.063961S","chronDate":"June 2005","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"31009","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"31009","articleId":"1440508","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1440514,"authors":[{"name":"S.

However, the results obtained using the second-order perturbation technique is in good agreement with numerical simulations even when the dispersion distance is longer than the nonlinear length. When pulses of different channels are copropagating in a fiber, they undergo amplitude distortion and timing shift due to XPM.

The combined effects of Raman nonlinearities and free-carrier losses induced by two-photon absorption (TPA) are analyzed using the coupled-mode theory. The analysis indicates that scaling down the lateral dimensions increases the conversion efficiency of the Raman process and reduces the effective lifetime of free carriers and hence ameliorates the free-carrier losses. The feasibility of data conversion is demonstrated by coherent transfer of the analog radio-frequency (RF) signal from Stokes to anti-Stokes channels. The conversion efficiency, and hence signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and bandwidth of the conversion process are found to be limited by the phase mismatch between the pump, Stokes, and anti-Stokes fields. The dispersion properties of submicrometer waveguides are also studied from the point of view of achieving phase matching and enhancing the conversion efficiency.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Parametric Raman wavelength conversion in scaled silicon waveguides","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2005.849895","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/50/31009/01440517.pdf","startPage":"2094","endPage":"2102","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2005.849895","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31009","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1440517","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1440517/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 June 2005","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 2005","displayDocTitle":"Parametric Raman wavelength conversion in scaled silicon waveguides","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"23","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/1440517/","dateOfInsertion":"13 June 2005","publicationDate":"June 2005","accessionNumber":"8448463","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Parametric Raman wavelength conversion in scaled silicon waveguides","sourcePdf":"01440517.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.086026S","chronDate":"June 2005","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"31009","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"73","xplore-issue":"31009","articleId":"1440517","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1440521,"authors":[{"name":"B.M.A. Rahman","affiliation":["School of Engineering and Mathematical Sciences, City University, London, UK"],"bio":{"p":["B.

The absolute stability analysis will be approached by characterizing absolutely contractively invariant (ACI) level sets of the composite quadratic Lyapunov functions. This objective will be achieved through three steps. The first step transforms the problem of absolute stability analysis into one of stability analysis for an array of saturated linear systems. The second step establishes stability conditions for linear difference inclusions and then for saturated linear systems. The third step assembles all the conditions of stability for an array of saturated linear systems into a condition of absolute stability. Based on the conditions for absolute stability, optimization problems are formulated for the estimation of the stability region.

This paper addresses recursive identification and adaptive inverse control of hysteresis in smart material actuators, where hysteresis is modeled by a Preisach operator with a piecewise uniform density function. Two classes of identification schemes are proposed and compared, one based on the hysteresis output, the other based on the time-difference of the output. Conditions for parameter convergence are presented in terms of the input to the Preisach operator. An adaptive inverse control scheme is developed by updating the Preisach operator (and thus its inverse) with the output-based identification method.

In this paper, we propose a statistical microwave imaging technique wherein a set of generalized likelihood ratio tests (GLRT) is applied to microwave backscatter data to determine the presence and location of strong scatterers such as malignant tumors in the breast. The GLRT is formulated assuming that the backscatter data is Gaussian distributed with known covariance matrix. We describe the method for estimating this covariance matrix offline and formulating a GLRT for several heterogeneous two-dimensional (2-D) numerical breast phantoms, several three-dimensional (3-D) experimental breast phantoms, and a 3-D numerical breast phantom with a realistic half-ellipsoid shape. Using the GLRT with the estimated covariance matrix and a threshold chosen to constrain the false discovery rate (FDR) of the image, we show the capability to detect and localize small (<0.6 cm) tumors in our numerical and experimental breast phantoms even when the dielectric contrast of the malignant-to-normal tissue is below 2:1.","doi":"10.1109/TBME.2005.847528","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/31012/01440602.pdf","startPage":"1237","endPage":"1250","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBME.2005.847528","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31012","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Ultrawideband microwave breast cancer detection: a detection-theoretic approach using the generalized likelihood ratio test","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1440602","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 June 2005","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1440602/","displayDocTitle":"Ultrawideband microwave breast cancer detection: a detection-theoretic approach using the generalized likelihood ratio test","volume":"52","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 2005","accessionNumber":"8473782","pubMedId":"16041987","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1440602/","dateOfInsertion":"13 June 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ultrawideband microwave breast cancer detection: a detection-theoretic approach using the generalized likelihood ratio test","sourcePdf":"01440602.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.092952S","chronDate":"July  2005","xplore-pub-id":"10","isNumber":"31012","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"91","xplore-issue":"31012","articleId":"1440602","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":1440607,"authors":[{"name":"Qinghui Tang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/10/31012/1440607/1440607-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Qinghui Tang received the B.E. in telecommunications engineering and M.E. degrees in information engineering from Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China, in 1995 and 1998, respectively.

Biosensors can be organized into clusters where most of the communication takes place within the clusters, and long range transmissions to the base station are performed by the cluster leader to reduce the energy cost. In some applications, the tissues are sensitive to temperature increase and may be damaged by the heat resulting from normal operations and the recharging of sensor nodes. Our work is the first to consider rotating the cluster leadership to minimize the heating effects on human tissues. We explore the factors that lead to temperature increase, and the process for calculating the specific absorption rate (SAR) and temperature increase of implanted biosensors by using the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method. We improve performance by rotating the cluster leader based on the leadership history and the sensor locations. We propose a simplified scheme, temperature increase potential, to efficiently predict the temperature increase in tissues surrounding implanted sensors. Finally, a genetic algorithm is proposed to exploit the search for an optimal temperature increase sequence.","doi":"10.1109/TBME.2005.847527","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/31012/01440607.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31012","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBME.2005.847527","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","startPage":"1285","endPage":"1294","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Communication scheduling to minimize thermal effects of implanted biosensor networks in homogeneous tissue","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1440607","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2005","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 June 2005","displayDocTitle":"Communication scheduling to minimize thermal effects of implanted biosensor networks in homogeneous tissue","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1440607/","volume":"52","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/1440607/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2005","accessionNumber":"8473787","pubMedId":"16041992","dateOfInsertion":"13 June 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Communication scheduling to minimize thermal effects of implanted biosensor networks in homogeneous tissue","sourcePdf":"01440607.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.099187S","chronDate":"July  2005","xplore-pub-id":"10","isNumber":"31012","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"141","xplore-issue":"31012","articleId":"1440607","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1440608,"authors":[{"name":"W.

To design low-impedance interfaces a complete understanding of the physical processes contributing to the impedance is required. In this work a model describing these physical processes is validated and extended to quantify the effect of organic coatings and incubation time. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy has been used to electrically characterize the interface for various electrode materials: platinum, platinum black, and titanium nitride; and varying electrode sizes: 1 cm/sup 2/, and 900 /spl mu/m/sup 2/. An equivalent circuit model comprising an interface capacitance, shunted by a charge transfer resistance, in series with the solution resistance has been fitted to the experimental results. Theoretical equations have been used to calculate the interface capacitance impedance and the solution resistance, yielding results that correspond well with the fitted parameter values, thereby confirming the validity of the equations. The effect of incubation time, and two organic cell-adhesion promoting coatings, poly-L-lysine and laminin, on the interface impedance has been quantified using the model. This demonstrates the benefits of using this model in developing a better understanding of the physical processes occurring at the interface in more complex, biomedically relevant situations.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1440608/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2005","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 June 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"52","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2005","dateOfInsertion":"13 June 2005","accessionNumber":"8473788","htmlLink":"/document/1440608/","pubMedId":"16041993","displayDocTitle":"Impedance characterization and modeling of electrodes for biomedical applications","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Impedance characterization and modeling of electrodes for biomedical applications","sourcePdf":"01440608.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.067883S","chronDate":"July  2005","xplore-pub-id":"10","isNumber":"31012","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"436","xplore-issue":"31012","articleId":"1440608","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1440609,"authors":[{"name":"R.H.

An eight-site probe for simultaneous neural recording and stimulation has been designed that includes on-chip amplifiers that can be individually bypassed, allowing direct access to the iridium sites for electrical stimulation. The on-probe amplifiers have a gain of 38.9 dB, an upper-cutoff frequency of 9.9 kHz, and an input-referred noise of 9.2 /spl mu/V /sub rms/ integrated from 100 Hz to 10 kHz. The low-frequency cutoff of the amplifier is tunable to allow the recording of field potentials and minimize stimulus artifact. The amplifier consumes 68 /spl mu/W from /spl plusmn/1.5 V supplies and occupies 0.177 mm/sup 2/ in 3 /spl mu/m features. In vivo recordings have shown that the preamplifiers can record single-unit activity 1 ms after the onset of stimulation on sites as close as 20 /spl mu/m to the stimulating electrode. A second neural recording array has been developed which multiplexes 32 neural signals onto four output data leads. Providing gain on this array eliminates the need for bulky head-mounted circuitry and reduces motion artifacts. The time-division multiplexing circuitry has crosstalk between consecutive channels of less than 6% at a sample rate of 20 kHz per channel. Amplified, time-division-multiplexed multichannel neural recording allows the large-scale recording of neuronal activity in freely behaving small animals with minimum number of interconnect leads.","doi":"10.1109/TBME.2005.847540","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/31012/01440609.pdf","startPage":"1303","endPage":"1311","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBME.2005.847540","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31012","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Band-tunable and multiplexed integrated circuits for simultaneous recording and stimulation with microelectrode arrays","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 June 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1440609/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2005","displayDocTitle":"Band-tunable and multiplexed integrated circuits for simultaneous recording and stimulation with microelectrode arrays","dateOfInsertion":"13 June 2005","htmlLink":"/document/1440609/","accessionNumber":"8473789","pubMedId":"16041994","volume":"52","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 2005","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Band-tunable and multiplexed integrated circuits for simultaneous recording and stimulation with microelectrode arrays","sourcePdf":"01440609.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.07375S","chronDate":"July  2005","xplore-pub-id":"10","isNumber":"31012","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"136","xplore-issue":"31012","articleId":"1440609","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1440616,"authors":[{"name":"Huiqi Li","affiliation":["Institute for Infocomm Research, Singapore, Singapore"],"lastName":"Huiqi Li","id":"37407160900"},{"name":"W.

One measure to quantify the severity of retinal arteriolar narrowing is the arteriolar-to-venular diameter ratio (AVR). The manual computation of AVR is a tedious process involving repeated measurements of the diameters of all arterioles and venules in the retinal images by human graders. Consistency and reproducibility are concerns. To facilitate large-scale clinical use in the general population, it is essential to have a precise, efficient and automatic system to compute this AVR. This paper describes a new approach to obtain AVR. The starting points of vessels are detected using a matched Gaussian filter. The detected vessels are traced with the help of a combined Kalman filter and Gaussian filter. A modified Gaussian model that takes into account the central light reflection of arterioles is proposed to describe the vessel profile. The width of a vessel is obtained by data fitting. Experimental results indicate a 97.1% success rate in the identification of vessel starting points, and a 99.2% success rate in the tracking of retinal vessels. The accuracy of the AVR computation is well within the acceptable range of deviation among the human graders, with a mean relative AVR error of 4.4%. The system has interested clinical research groups worldwide and will be tested in clinical studies.","doi":"10.1109/TBME.2005.847402","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/31012/01440616.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBME.2005.847402","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31012","startPage":"1352","endPage":"1355","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Automatic grading of retinal vessel caliber","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1440616","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Automatic grading of retinal vessel caliber","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1440616/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 June 2005","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"52","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 2005","accessionNumber":"8473796","pubMedId":"16042001","dateOfInsertion":"13 June 2005","htmlLink":"/document/1440616/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automatic grading of retinal vessel caliber","sourcePdf":"01440616.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.101628S","chronDate":"July  2005","xplore-pub-id":"10","isNumber":"31012","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"75","xplore-issue":"31012","articleId":"1440616","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-24"},{"_id":1440628,"authors":[{"name":"T.Y.W.

Neurons tuned to different stimulus features but the same retinal position are grouped into retinotopic arrays of hypercolumns. This paper describes a neuromorphic implementation of orientation hypercolumns, which consists of a single silicon retina feeding multiple chips, each of which contains an array of neurons tuned to the same orientation and spatial frequency, but different retinal locations. All chips operate in continuous time, and communicate with each other using spikes transmitted by the address-event representation protocol. This system is modular in the sense that orientation coverage can be increased simply by adding more chips, and expandable in the sense that its output can be used to construct neurons tuned to other stimulus dimensions. We present measured results from the system, demonstrating neuronal selectivity along position, spatial frequency and orientation. We also demonstrate that the system supports recurrent feedback between neurons within one hypercolumn, even though they reside on different chips. The measured results from the system are in excellent concordance with theoretical predictions.","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2005.849136","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel5/8919/31013/01440628.pdf","startPage":"1049","endPage":"1060","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2005.849136","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31013","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neuromorphic implementation of orientation hypercolumns","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1440628","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 July 2005","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1440628/","displayDocTitle":"Neuromorphic implementation of orientation hypercolumns","volume":"52","issue":"6","publicationDate":"June 2005","accessionNumber":"8485286","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1440628/","dateOfInsertion":"05 July 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neuromorphic implementation of orientation hypercolumns","sourcePdf":"01440628.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.123773S","chronDate":"June 2005","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"31013","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"93","xplore-issue":"31013","articleId":"1440628","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":1440629,"authors":[{"name":"S.M.R.

Due to good matching accuracy of devices, the circuit generates stable rhythmic patterns for robot locomotion control. From experimental results on fabricated chip using a standard CMOS 1.5-/spl mu/m process, we show that the chip yields the desired results; i.e., stable rhythmic pattern generation and low power consumption.","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2005.849120","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel5/8919/31013/01440632.pdf","startPage":"1095","endPage":"1103","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2005.849120","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31013","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1440632","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analog CMOS implementation of a CNN-based locomotion controller with floating-gate devices","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 2005","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 July 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1440632/","displayDocTitle":"Analog CMOS implementation of a CNN-based locomotion controller with floating-gate devices","volume":"52","issue":"6","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1440632/","publicationDate":"June 2005","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"05 July 2005","accessionNumber":"8485290","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analog CMOS implementation of a CNN-based locomotion controller with floating-gate devices","sourcePdf":"01440632.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.088449S","chronDate":"June 2005","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"31013","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"31013","articleId":"1440632","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":1440634,"authors":[{"name":"P.

These results show that the proposed approach leads on average to approximately 10% faster multipliers than the fastest known structures for the diminished-1 representation based on the modified Booth recoding. Moreover, they also show that the proposed architecture is the only one taking advantage of this recoding to obtain faster multipliers with a significant reduction in hardware.

The structure of the blind inverse system is explicitly derived within the framework of maximum likelihood estimation and the system culminates to a special architecture of the 3-layer perceptron neural network where the parameters in the first layer are inversely related to the output layer. The proposed approach exploits both the structural and signal constraints to search for the solution and assumes that the cumulants of the source signals are known a priori. A novel statistical algorithm based on the hybridization of the generalized gradient algorithm and metropolis algorithm has been derived for training the proposed perceptron which results in improved performance in terms of accuracy and convergence speed. Simulations and real-life experiment have also been conducted to verify the efficacy of the proposed scheme in separating the nonlinearly mixed signals.","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2005.849122","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel5/8919/31013/01440645.pdf","startPage":"1236","endPage":"1247","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2005.849122","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31013","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neural network approach to blind signal separation of mono-nonlinearly mixed sources","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1440645","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 July 2005","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1440645/","displayDocTitle":"Neural network approach to blind signal separation of mono-nonlinearly mixed sources","volume":"52","issue":"6","publicationDate":"June 2005","accessionNumber":"8485303","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1440645/","dateOfInsertion":"05 July 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural network approach to blind signal separation of mono-nonlinearly mixed sources","sourcePdf":"01440645.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.08038S","chronDate":"June 2005","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"31013","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"31013","articleId":"1440645","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":1440654,"authors":[{"name":"Xianren Wu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Michigan Technological University, Houghton, MI, USA"],"lastName":"Xianren Wu","id":"37087272567"},{"name":"H.R.

With this structure, near optimal MLD performance can be achieved at low complexity through TS processing. The first stage of processing estimates a minimum sufficient set (MSS) of candidate codewords that contains the optimal codeword, while the second stage performs optimal or suboptimal decoding search within the estimated MSS of small size. Based on the new structure, we propose a decoding algorithm that systematically trades off between the decoding complexity and the bounded block error rate performance. A low-complexity complementary decoding algorithm is developed to estimate the MSS, followed by an ordered algebraic decoding (OAD) algorithm to achieve flexible system design. Since the size of the MSS changes with the signal-to-noise ratio, the overall decoding complexity adaptively scales with the quality of the communication link. Theoretical analysis is provided to evaluate the potential complexity reduction enabled by the proposed decoding structure.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1440654/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 2005","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 June 2005","htmlLink":"/document/1440654/","dateOfInsertion":"13 June 2005","publicationDate":"June 2005","accessionNumber":"8473839","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"53","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A new adaptive two-stage maximum-likelihood decoding algorithm for linear block codes","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new adaptive two-stage maximum-likelihood decoding algorithm for linear block codes","sourcePdf":"01440654.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.055644S","chronDate":"June 2005","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"31014","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"31014","articleId":"1440654","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":1440656,"authors":[{"name":"Zexian Li","affiliation":["Centre for Wireless Communications, University of Oulu, Oulu, Finland"],"lastName":"Zexian Li","id":"37279077900"},{"name":"M.

In this letter, switching between spatial multiplexing and transmit diversity is proposed as a simple way to improve the diversity performance of spatial multiplexing. In the proposed approach, for a fixed rate, either multiplexing or diversity is chosen based on the instantaneous channel state and the decision is conveyed to the transmitter via a low-rate feedback channel. The minimum Euclidean distance at the receiver is computed for spatial multiplexing and transmit diversity and is used to derive the selection criterion. Additionally, the Demmel condition number of the matrix channel is shown to provide a sufficient condition for multiplexing to outperform diversity. Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate improvement over either multiplexing or diversity individually in terms of bit error rate.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/31014/01440664.pdf","startPage":"962","endPage":"968","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2005.849774","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2005.849774","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31014","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1440664","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Switching between diversity and multiplexing in MIMO systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Transmitters","Euclidean distance","Transmitting antennas","Communication switching","Wireless communication","Receiving antennas","Cultural differences","Error probability","State feedback"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["diversity reception","MIMO systems","multiplexing","feedback","telecommunication channels","radio receivers","Monte Carlo methods","error statistics","space-time codes","channel coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["transmit diversity","MIMO system","multiple-input multiple-output wireless communication system","spatial multiplexing","instantaneous channel state","feedback channel","minimum Euclidean distance","matrix channel","Monte Carlo simulation","bit error rate","BER","space-time coding","channel coding"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems","space-time coding","transmit diversity"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1440664/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 2005","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 June 2005","displayDocTitle":"Switching between diversity and multiplexing in MIMO systems","volume":"53","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/1440664/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2005","accessionNumber":"8473848","dateOfInsertion":"13 June 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Switching between diversity and multiplexing in MIMO systems","sourcePdf":"01440664.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.087996S","chronDate":"June 2005","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"31014","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"292","xplore-issue":"31014","articleId":"1440664","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1440665,"authors":[{"name":"F.-C.

The proposed scheme provides flexible designs of noncoherent block codes with different code rate, block length and error performance. Good noncoherent block codes can be easily obtained by properly choosing binary linear block codes as the component codes. Moreover, noncoherent block codes of this new scheme can be decoded by multistage decoding, which has the advantage of low complexity and satisfactory error performance. In this paper, two algorithms of multistage decoding for noncoherent detection are proposed as well. The error performance of some designed codes and decoding algorithms is verified by computer simulation.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2005.849989","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/31014/01440667.pdf","startPage":"978","endPage":"986","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2005.849989","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31014","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Noncoherent block-coded MPSK","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1440667","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 June 2005","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1440667/","displayDocTitle":"Noncoherent block-coded MPSK","volume":"53","issue":"6","publicationDate":"June 2005","accessionNumber":"8473851","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1440667/","dateOfInsertion":"13 June 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Noncoherent block-coded MPSK","sourcePdf":"01440667.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.070607S","chronDate":"June 2005","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"31014","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"31014","articleId":"1440667","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1440668,"authors":[{"name":"E.

The proposed retransmission strategy attempts to maximize user throughput while satisfying a maximum packet delay constraint. The performance of our reliability-based HARQ algorithm is evaluated in static and time-varying channels through simulations.

The proposed system improves the performance in terms of error correction with respect to a separated source and channel coding approach based on convolutional codes, with the additional great advantage of allowing complete flexibility in adjusting the coding rate. The proposed MAP decoder is tested in the case of image transmission across the additive white Gaussian noise channel and compared against standard forward error correction techniques in terms of performance and complexity.

In this paper, we show that PSAM schemes can be improved by adapting the coded modulation strategy at the sender to the quality of the channel measurement at the receiver, without requiring any channel feedback from the receiver. We consider performance in terms of achievable rate for binary signaling schemes. The transmitter employs interleaved codes, with data symbols coded according to their distance from the nearest pilot symbols. Symbols far away from pilot symbols encounter poorer channel measurements at the receiver and are therefore coded with lower rate codes, while symbols close to pilot symbols benefit from recent channel measurements and are coded with higher rate codes. The performance benefits from this approach are quantified in the context of binary signaling over time-varying Rayleigh fading channels described by a Gauss-Markov model. The spacing of the pilot symbols is optimized to maximize the mutual information between input and output in this setting. Causal and noncausal channel estimators of varying complexity and delay are considered. It is shown that, by appropriate optimization for the spacing between consecutive pilot symbols, the adaptive coding techniques proposed can improve achievable rate, without any feedback from the receiver to the sender. Moreover, channel estimation based on the two closest pilot symbols is generally close to optimal.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2005.849998","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31014","startPage":"1036","endPage":"1046","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/31014/01440673.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Binary adaptive coded pilot symbol assisted modulation over Rayleigh fading channels without feedback","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1440673/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 2005","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 June 2005","htmlLink":"/document/1440673/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Binary adaptive coded pilot symbol assisted modulation over Rayleigh fading channels without feedback","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2005","accessionNumber":"8473857","dateOfInsertion":"13 June 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"53","issue":"6","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Binary adaptive coded pilot symbol assisted modulation over Rayleigh fading channels without feedback","sourcePdf":"01440673.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.103173S","chronDate":"June 2005","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"31014","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"37","xplore-issue":"31014","articleId":"1440673","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1440674,"authors":[{"name":"Jung-Hyuck Jo","affiliation":["Samsung Networks, Seoul, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/31014/1440674/1440674-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jung-Hyuck Jo (S'98\u2013M'02) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electronics engineering from Korea University, Seoul, Korea, in 1994 and 1996, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical and computer engineering from the Georgia Institute of Technology (Georgia Tech), Atlanta, in 2003.","Since 2003 he has been with Samsung Networks, where he is leading the internet business development group.

The main contribution of this paper is the observation that when all of the path angles from all 500 trials are measured relative to one building wall and collectively analyzed in a signal strength distribution, clustering is clearly apparent. While this angle clustering in the ensemble of channels is not the same as clustering in a single channel trial, it may partially account for the clusters observed in single trials. As a practical matter, these results may impact the use and placement of directional antennas for wireless LANs in buildings of this type.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/31014/01440674.pdf","startPage":"1047","endPage":"1052","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2005.849979","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2005.849979","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31014","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1440674","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Deterministic angle clustering in rectangular buildings based on ray-tracing","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Ray tracing","Phased arrays","Antennas and propagation","Adaptive arrays","Solid modeling","Directional antennas","Wireless LAN","Diversity reception","Bandwidth","MIMO"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ray tracing","radio transmitters","radio receivers","wireless LAN","directive antennas","antenna arrays","indoor radio","multipath channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["deterministic angle clustering","rectangular building","three-dimensional ray-tracing","radio transmitter","radio receiver","signal strength distribution","directional antenna","wireless LAN","antenna array","indoor radio communication","local area network","multipath channel"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Indoor radio communication","local area networks","multipath channels","propagation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1440674/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2005","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 June 2005","displayDocTitle":"Deterministic angle clustering in rectangular buildings based on ray-tracing","volume":"53","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/1440674/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2005","accessionNumber":"8473858","dateOfInsertion":"13 June 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Deterministic angle clustering in rectangular buildings based on ray-tracing","sourcePdf":"01440674.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.088743S","chronDate":"June  2005","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"31014","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"31014","articleId":"1440674","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":1440675,"authors":[{"name":"Bo Hu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/31014/1440675/1440675-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Bo Hu (S\u201902) received the B.S. and M.Sc. degrees in information and communication engineering from Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China, in 1998 and 2001, respectively.

It is shown that direct-sequence binary phase-shift keying outperforms time-hopping binary phase-shift keying for medium and large values of signal-to-noise ratio, which contradicts some previous results obtained using a Gaussian approximation.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2005.849792","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/31014/01440675.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2005.849792","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31014","startPage":"1053","endPage":"1062","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Accurate performance evaluation of time-hopping and direct-sequence UWB systems in multi-user interference","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1440675","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Accurate performance evaluation of time-hopping and direct-sequence UWB systems in multi-user interference","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1440675/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 June 2005","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"53","issue":"6","publicationDate":"June 2005","accessionNumber":"8473859","dateOfInsertion":"13 June 2005","htmlLink":"/document/1440675/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Accurate performance evaluation of time-hopping and direct-sequence UWB systems in multi-user interference","sourcePdf":"01440675.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.106875S","chronDate":"June 2005","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"31014","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"105","xplore-issue":"31014","articleId":"1440675","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1440686,"authors":[{"name":"A.S.

The effectiveness of many of these systems depend on maximizing the reception of RF power and extracting maximum information from the incident electromagnetic (EM) wave. Traditionally, this has been achieved through multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems employing a spatial array of antennas that enhance the channel capacity. In this paper, we report similar increases in channel capacity obtained through the use of vector antennas consisting of co-located loops and dipoles, which can respond to more than one component of the EM field. It is shown that systems with three- and four-element vector antennas at both the transmitter and receiver operating around the frequency of 2.25 GHz support three and four times more information, respectively, as compared to conventional systems consisting of sensors with single antennas. Comparison with a simplified theoretical model of a MIMO system with co-located antennas in a rich multipath environment shows good agreement.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Increasing wireless channel capacity through MIMO systems employing co-located antennas","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.2005.848105","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel5/22/31015/01440686.pdf","startPage":"1837","endPage":"1844","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.2005.848105","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31015","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1440686","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1440686/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 June 2005","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 2005","displayDocTitle":"Increasing wireless channel capacity through MIMO systems employing co-located antennas","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"53","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/1440686/","dateOfInsertion":"13 June 2005","publicationDate":"June 2005","accessionNumber":"8481564","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Increasing wireless channel capacity through MIMO systems employing co-located antennas","sourcePdf":"01440686.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.134774S","chronDate":"June 2005","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"31015","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"84","xplore-issue":"31015","articleId":"1440686","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1440691,"authors":[{"name":"Jeongwoo Han","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, Texas A and M University, College Station, TX, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/31015/1440691/1440691-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jeongwoo Han was born in Pohang, Korea, in May 1966.

By taking advantage of an ever increasing number of metal layers in the modern CMOS process, the proposed structure can continuously reduce the inductor area and increase the quality factor (QF) and self-resonant frequency (SRF). Experimental results show that, compared to the 4.1-nH planar spiral inductor using a six-metal layer process, the 4.8-nH vertical solenoid inductor approximately gives a 20% increase in the maximum QF and 50% increase in the SRF, but only occupies 20% of the area. A detailed design methodology for the optimal inductor geometry will be explained. Using a standard six-metal layer CMOS process, simulation results indicate that an inductor with a 40-/spl mu/m radius and 10-/spl mu/m metal width should be used for an amplifier load, which requires 30% frequency tuning range at 5.2 GHz. An additional 7.8-dB signal gain can be obtained if the frequency tuning range requirement is reduced by one-half.

The complexity and cost of a radar front-end phased array can be decreased by applying a beam-steering/switching concept, which reduces the number of parallel RF and baseband signal paths. RF-microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) subsystems are employed because of their excellent RF properties and potential low-cost manufacturability. We present design considerations for prototypical automotive applications of RF-MEMS-based automotive radar front-ends using phased-array antennas based on phase shifters or a Rotman lens. The single RF-MEMS switch is optimized with respect to its RF and thermomechanical behavior taking into account automotive requirements. The respective RF-MEMS subsystems, i.e., phase shifters and single-pole-multiple-throw switching networks are presented in conjunction with packaging and mounting approaches. We evaluate two different wafer-level packaging technologies using glass-frit sealing or polymer sealing. Finally, functional packaged devices are demonstrated: a glass-frit-sealed and flip-chip-mounted RF-MEMS switch and a benzocyclobutene-packaged single-pole-quadruple-throw switch network.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1440712/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 2005","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 June 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"53","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2005","dateOfInsertion":"13 June 2005","accessionNumber":"8481580","htmlLink":"/document/1440712/","displayDocTitle":"Design considerations and technology assessment of phased-array antenna systems with RF MEMS for automotive radar applications","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design considerations and technology assessment of phased-array antenna systems with RF MEMS for automotive radar applications","sourcePdf":"01440712.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.068718S","chronDate":"June 2005","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"31016","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"78","xplore-issue":"31016","articleId":"1440712","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1440714,"authors":[{"name":"J.P.

The amplifier fabricated in pseudomorphic high electron-mobility technology can deliver a gain of 17.9 dB with an input return loss of 21.0 dB and an output return loss of 22.7 dB in the 77-GHz band, while keeping lower than -16.5dB of gain in the out-of band. Over the temperature range from -20/spl deg/C to 100/spl deg/C, the measured results show that a gain variation of less than 2.0 dB is achieved by using the attenuator, while the gain variation without the attenuator is as large as 6.0 dB.

It was revealed that the IM3 of inverse class F is lower than that of class F at high input power (P/sub in/), although the better class for IM3 at low P/sub in/ changes from class F to inverse class F according to the increase of the quiescent current (I/sub q/). The different IM3 behaviors are mainly caused by the different gain variations in both amplifiers. At a low P/sub in/, the gain of class F is larger than that of inverse class F. The larger gain in class F causes a gradual gain decrease and a steep gain rise at high and low I/sub q/, respectively. On the other hand, the gain of inverse class F is larger than that of class F at a high P/sub in/. The larger gain in inverse class F causes a gradual gain decrease at all I/sub q/ values. These gradual gain decreases are one of main causes of a lower IM3. These phenomena can be explained by the output current (I/sub out/) and voltage (V/sub out/) waveforms, which differ according to the harmonic loads. The I/sub out/ and V/sub out/ positive half-sinusoidal waveforms, which consist of in-phase second harmonics, are effective for large-gain operations. The positive half-sinusoidal I/sub out/ waveform of the class-F amplifier prevents a gain decrease at a low P/sub in/ and high I/sub q/, and the similar V/sub out/ waveform in inverse class F prevents a gain decrease at a high P/sub in/.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1440732/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 2005","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 June 2005","htmlLink":"/document/1440732/","dateOfInsertion":"13 June 2005","publicationDate":"June 2005","accessionNumber":"8491338","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"53","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Intermodulation distortion analysis of class-F and inverse class-F HBT amplifiers","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Intermodulation distortion analysis of class-F and inverse class-F HBT amplifiers","sourcePdf":"01440732.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.06628S","chronDate":"June 2005","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"31016","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"31016","articleId":"1440732","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1440733,"authors":[{"name":"I.

With the proposed technique, a single asymmetric DGS provides two different resonance frequencies because of the different sizes of spiral-shaped defects on the ground plane. The transfer function of the asymmetric DGS shows signal rejection characteristics at two different resonance frequencies and the characteristics of asymmetric DGS is modeled by two parallel RLC resonance circuits in cascade. With the insertion of asymmetric spiral DGS into a quarter-wave line of the Wilkinson power divider, the second and third harmonics are suppressed simultaneously. In experimental results, 18-dB suppression for the second harmonic and 15-dB suppression for the third harmonic, respectively, are achieved. Using asymmetric DGS, the size of a quarter-wave line is reduced by 9.1% compared to that of the conventional divider without a DGS.","pdfPath":"/iel5/22/31016/01440734.pdf","startPage":"2139","endPage":"2144","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31016","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.2005.848772","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.2005.848772","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1440734","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power system harmonics","Power dividers","Dual band","Spirals","Resonance","Power harmonic filters","Resonant frequency","Microstrip","Harmonics suppression","RLC circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power dividers","harmonics suppression","transfer functions","RLC circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Wilkinson power divider","dual-band rejection","second harmonic suppression","third harmonic suppression","defected ground structure","resonance frequency","spiral-shaped defects","ground plane","transfer function","signal rejection characteristics","parallel RLC resonance circuits","asymmetric spiral DGS","quarter-wave line"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Asymmetric spiral defected ground structure (DGS)","harmonic suppression","two resonance frequencies","Wilkinson power divider"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1440734/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 June 2005","displayDocTitle":"Suppression of harmonics in Wilkinson power divider using dual-band rejection by asymmetric DGS","accessionNumber":"8491340","dateOfInsertion":"13 June 2005","publicationDate":"June 2005","htmlLink":"/document/1440734/","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"53","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Suppression of harmonics in Wilkinson power divider using dual-band rejection by asymmetric DGS","sourcePdf":"01440734.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.049238S","chronDate":"June 2005","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"31016","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"166","xplore-issue":"31016","articleId":"1440734","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1440735,"authors":[{"name":"E.

Numerous miniaturized easy-to-design passive circuits that can be used as critical building blocks for millimeter-wave SOP modules have hereby been realized with high-performance and high-integration potential. One miniaturized slotted-patch resonator has been designed by the optimal use of vertical coupling mechanism and transverse cuts and has been utilized to realize compact duplexers (39.8/59 GHz) and three- and five-pole bandpass filters by the novel 3-D (vertical and parallel) deployment of single-mode patch resonators. Measured results agree very well with the simulated data. One multiplexing filter, called the directional channel-separation filter, that can also be used in mixer applications shows insertion loss of <3 dB over the bandpass frequency band and a rejection /spl sim/25 dB at around 38.5 GHz over the band-rejection section. LTCC fabrication limitations have been overcome by using vertical coupling mechanisms to satisfy millimeter-wave design requirements. Lastly, a double-fed cross-shaped microstrip antenna has been designed for the purpose of doubling the data throughput by means of a dual-polarized wireless channel, covering the band between 59-64 GHz. This antenna can be easily integrated into a wireless millimeter-wave link system.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1440743/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 2005","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 June 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"53","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2005","dateOfInsertion":"13 June 2005","accessionNumber":"8491347","htmlLink":"/document/1440743/","displayDocTitle":"Highly integrated millimeter-wave passive components using 3-D LTCC system-on-package (SOP) technology","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Highly integrated millimeter-wave passive components using 3-D LTCC system-on-package (SOP) technology","sourcePdf":"01440743.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.065297S","chronDate":"June 2005","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"31016","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"81","xplore-issue":"31016","articleId":"1440743","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1440746,"authors":[{"name":"A.

A generalized analytical approach for finding phase-only predistortion functions to linearize these amplifiers is presented. Two distinct analytical solutions are found and are applied for phase-only linearization. The first solution consists of a static constant phase predistortion, which is introduced in one of the two RF amplifier branches. This constant phase is determined analytically as function of the value of the reactance of the stub used in the Chireix combiner. The second solution is a variable phase-distortion function, which is derived in explicit form. The two predistortion functions preserve constant envelope operation of the amplifiers. The impact of the two predistortion functions on the combiner efficiency is also investigated. It is found, through simulation with a code-division multiple-access signal and an experimental measurement with a 16 quadrature-amplifier-modulation signal that the two predistortion functions perfectly linearize the amplifier. It also shown analytically that, with perfect linearity, the efficiency of Chireix-outphasing amplifier is reduced and is, at best, equal to that of the LINC amplifier with a resistive combiner.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel5/22/31016/01440746.pdf","startPage":"2240","endPage":"2250","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.2005.848748","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.2005.848748","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31016","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1440746","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Phase-only predistortion for LINC amplifiers with Chireix-outphasing combiners","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Predistortion","Linearity","Radiofrequency amplifiers","Degradation","Phase distortion","Power amplifiers","Open loop systems","Nonlinear distortion","Radiofrequency identification","Operational amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power amplifiers","nonlinear distortion","power combiners","radiofrequency amplifiers","linearisation techniques","code division multiple access","radio transmitters","distortion"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["phase-only predistortion","LINC amplifier","Chireix-outphasing combiner","linear amplification with nonlinear components","amplifier linearization","RF amplifier","stub reactance","variable phase distortion function","code-division multiple-access signal","quadrature-amplifier-modulation signal","microwave transmitter","power amplifier"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Distortion","linear amplification with nonlinear components (LINC)","microwave transmitter","phase distortion","power amplifiers","predistortion"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1440746/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 2005","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 June 2005","displayDocTitle":"Phase-only predistortion for LINC amplifiers with Chireix-outphasing combiners","volume":"53","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/1440746/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2005","accessionNumber":"8491350","dateOfInsertion":"13 June 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Phase-only predistortion for LINC amplifiers with Chireix-outphasing combiners","sourcePdf":"01440746.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.065316S","chronDate":"June 2005","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"31016","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"31016","articleId":"1440746","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1440838,"authors":[{"name":"M.

We propose a protocol for node sleep scheduling that guarantees a bounded-delay sensing coverage while maximizing network lifetime. Our sleep scheduling ensures that coverage rotates such that each point in the environment is sensed within some finite interval of time, called the detection delay. The framework is optimized for rare event detection and allows favorable compromises to be achieved between event detection delay and lifetime without sacrificing (eventual) coverage for each point. We compare different sleep scheduling policies in terms of average detection delay, and show that ours is closest to the detection delay lower bound for stationary event surveillance. We also explain the inherent relationship between detection delay, which applies to persistent events, and detection probability, which applies to temporary events. Finally, a connectivity maintenance protocol is proposed to minimize the delay of multi-hop delivery to a base-station. The resulting sleep schedule achieves the lowest overall target surveillance delay given constraints on energy consumption.","doi":"10.1109/IPSN.2005.1440887","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IPSN.2005.1440887","startPage":"20","endPage":"27","displayPublicationTitle":"IPSN 2005.

In this paper, we present a distributed architecture for solving these problems that is robust to unreliable communication and node failures. In this architecture, the nodes of the sensor network assemble themselves into a junction tree and exchange messages between neighbors to solve the inference problem efficiently and exactly. A key part of the architecture is an efficient distributed algorithm for optimizing the choice of junction tree to minimize the communication and computation required by inference.

However, as location-based services become more prevalent, the localization infrastructure will become the target of malicious attacks. These attacks will not be conventional security threats, but rather threats that adversely affect the ability of localization schemes to provide trustworthy location information. This paper identifies a list of attacks that are unique to localization algorithms. Since these attacks are diverse in nature, and there may be many unforeseen attacks that can bypass traditional security countermeasures, it is desirable to alter the underlying localization algorithms to be robust to intentionally corrupted measurements. In this paper, we develop robust statistical methods to make localization attack-tolerant. We examine two broad classes of localization: triangulation and RF-based fingerprinting methods. For triangulation-based localization, we propose an adaptive least squares and least median squares position estimator that has the computational advantages of least squares in the absence of attacks and is capable of switching to a robust mode when being attacked. We introduce robustness to fingerprinting localization through the use of a median-based distance metric. Finally, we evaluate our robust localization schemes under different threat conditions.","doi":"10.1109/IPSN.2005.1440903","publicationTitle":"IPSN 2005.

Despite the recent advances, location discovery for sensor networks in hostile environments has been mostly overlooked. Most of the existing localization protocols for sensor networks are vulnerable in hostile environments. The security of location discovery can certainly be enhanced by authentication. However, the possible node compromises and the fact that location determination uses certain physical features (e.g., received signal strength) of radio signals make authentication not as effective as in traditional security applications. This paper presents two methods to tolerate malicious attacks against beacon-based location discovery in sensor networks. The first method filters out malicious beacon signals on the basis of the \"consistency\" among multiple beacon signals, while the second method tolerates malicious beacon signals by adopting an it era lively refined voting scheme. Both methods can survive malicious attacks even if the attacks bypass authentication, provided that the benign beacon signals constitute the majority of the \"consistent\" beacon signals. This paper also presents the implementation of these techniques on MICA2 motes running TinyOS, and the evaluation through both simulation and field experiments. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed methods are promising for the current generation of sensor networks.","doi":"10.1109/IPSN.2005.1440904","publicationTitle":"IPSN 2005.

We focus on the important problem of detection of distributed events, sources, or abnormalities that are localized, i.e., only a small number of sensors in the vicinity of the phenomena are in the field of observation. This problem complements the standard decentralized detection problem, where noisy information about an event is measured by the entire network. For localized phenomena the main difficulty arises from the coupling of: a) noisy sensor observations that lead to local false positives/negatives; and b) limited energy, which constrains communication among sensor nodes. Together these difficulties call for reaching a decentralized statistical ordering based on limited collaboration. We are then led to the following fundamental problem: determine the most probable event locations while minimizing communication cost. Our objective in this paper is to characterize the fundamental trade offs between global performance (false alarms and miss rate) and communication cost. We develop a framework to minimize the communication cost subject to worst-case misclassification constraints by making use of the false discovery rate (FDR) concept along with an optimal local measure transformation at each sensor node. The preliminary results show that the FDR concept applied in a sensor networks context leads to significant reduction in the communication cost of the system. A very interesting implication of this work is that the detection performance of a wireless sensor network is comparable to that of a wired network of sensors.","doi":"10.1109/IPSN.2005.1440916","pdfPath":"/iel5/9840/31018/01440916.pdf","startPage":"143","endPage":"150","displayPublicationTitle":"IPSN 2005.

The distributed particle filters run on a set of uncorrelated sensor cliques that are dynamically organized based on moving target trajectories. These two algorithms differ in how the distributive computing is performed. In the first algorithm, partial results are updated at each sensor clique sequentially based on partial results forwarded from a neighboring clique and local observations. In the second algorithm, all individual cliques compute partial estimates based only on local observations in parallel, and forward their estimates to a fusion center to obtain final output. In order to conserve bandwidth and power, the local sufficient statistics (belief) is approximated by a low dimensional Gaussian mixture model (GMM) before propagating among sensor cliques. We further prove that the posterior distribution estimated by distributed particle filter convergence almost surely to the posterior distribution estimated from a centralized Bayesian formula. Moreover, a data-adaptive application layer communication protocol is proposed to facilitate sensor self-organization and collaboration.

We propose a novel source-channel matching approach for distributed field estimation that naturally integrates these basic operations and facilitates a unified analysis of the impact of key parameters (number of nodes, power, field complexity) on estimation accuracy. At the heart of our approach is a distributed source-channel communication architecture that matches the spatial scale of field coherence with the spatial scale of node synchronization for phase-coherent communication: the sensor field is uniformly partitioned into multiple cells and the nodes in each cell coherently communicate simple statistics of their measurements to the destination via a dedicated noisy multiple access channel (MAC). Essentially, the optimal field estimate in each cell is implicitly computed at the destination via the coherent spatial averaging inherent in the MAC, resulting in optimal power-distortion scaling with the number of nodes. In general, smoother fields demand lower per-node power but require node synchronization over larger scales for optimal estimation. In particular, optimal mean-square distortion scaling can be achieved with sub-linear power scaling. Our results also reveal a remarkable power-density tradeoff inherent in our approach: increasing the sensor density reduces the total power required to achieve a desired distortion. A direct consequence is that consistent field estimation is possible, in principle, even with vanishing total power in the limit of high sensor density.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Matched source-channel communication for field estimation in wireless sensor network","publicationTitle":"IPSN 2005.

Using a Texas Instruments MSP430 microcontroller, Chipcon IEEE 802.15.4-compliant radio, and USB, Telos' power profile is almost one-tenth the consumption of previous mote platforms while providing greater performance and throughput.

Recent progress in two seemingly disparate research areas namely, distributed robotics and low power embedded systems has led to the creation of mobile (or robotic) sensor networks. Autonomous node mobility brings with it its own challenges, but also alleviates some of the traditional problems associated with static sensor networks. We illustrate this by presenting the design of the robomote, a robot platform that functions as a single mobile node in a mobile sensor network. We briefly describe two case studies where the robomote has been used for table top experiments with a mobile sensor network.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"15 April 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1440957/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"8613369","publicationDate":"2005","conferenceDate":"15-15 April 2005","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1440957/","dateOfInsertion":"13 June 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Robomote: enabling mobility in sensor networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robomote: enabling mobility in sensor networks","confLoc":"Boise, ID, USA","sourcePdf":"01440957.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.123771S","chronDate":"15 April 2005","xplore-pub-id":"9840","isNumber":"31018","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9840","citationCount":"190","xplore-issue":"31018","articleId":"1440957","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1440970,"authors":[{"name":"D.

Its new features include support for two different CPU sleep modes and a long-term ultra low power sleep mode for the entire node. This allows the XYZ and its peripheral boards to transition into deep sleep for extended time intervals. To support mobility hardware control and computations, XYZ supports a wide dynamic range and power options. In low power configuration the node resembles existing small low power nodes. When needed, the node can scale up its resources to perform more powerful computations. Mobility is enabled with an additional accessory board that allows the node to move along a horizontal string.

Environmental energy harvesting, in particular solar based, has emerged as a viable technique to supplement battery supplies. However, designing an efficient solar harvesting system to realize the potential benefits of energy harvesting requires an in-depth understanding of several factors. For example, solar energy supply is highly time varying and may not always be sufficient to power the embedded system. Harvesting components, such as solar panels, and energy storage elements, such as batteries or ultracapacitors, have different voltage-current characteristics, which must be matched to each other as well as the energy requirements of the system to maximize harvesting efficiency. Further, battery non-idealities, such as self-discharge and round trip efficiency, directly affect energy usage and storage decisions. The ability of the system to modulate its power consumption by selectively deactivating its sub-components also impacts the overall power management architecture. This paper describes key issues and tradeoffs which arise in the design of solar energy harvesting, wireless embedded systems and presents the design, implementation, and performance evaluation of Heliomote, our prototype that addresses several of these issues. Experimental results demonstrate that Heliomote, which behaves as a plug-in to the Berkeley/Crossbow motes and autonomously manages energy harvesting and storage, enables near-perpetual, harvesting aware operation of the sensor node.","doi":"10.1109/IPSN.2005.1440973","publicationTitle":"IPSN 2005.

While most previous efforts in simulating wireless sensor networks have focused on protocol-level issues utilizing models of the software implementation, a significant challenge remains in precisely measuring time-dependent properties such as radio channel utilization. One promising approach, first demonstrated by ATEMU, is to simulate the behavior of sensor network programs at the machine code level with cycle-accuracy, but poor performance has so far limited its scalability. In this paper we present Avrora, a cycle-accurate instruction-level sensor network simulator which scales to networks of up to 10,000 nodes and performs as much as 20 times faster than previous simulators with equivalent accuracy, handling as many as 25 nodes in real-time. We show how an event queue can enable efficient instruction-level simulation of microcontroller programs and allow the hidden parallelism in finegrained sensor network simulations to be extracted, once two core synchronization problems are identified and solved. Avrora's ability to measure detailed time-critical phenomena can shed new light on design Issues for large-scale sensor networks.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1440978/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15 April 2005","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"15-15 April 2005","htmlLink":"/document/1440978/","dateOfInsertion":"13 June 2005","publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8613381","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Avrora: scalable sensor network simulation with precise timing","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Avrora: scalable sensor network simulation with precise timing","confLoc":"Boise, ID, USA","sourcePdf":"01440978.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047078S","chronDate":"15 April 2005","xplore-pub-id":"9840","isNumber":"31018","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9840","citationCount":"250","xplore-issue":"31018","articleId":"1440978","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1440983,"authors":[{"name":"Prabal Dutta","affiliation":["Ohio State Uinversity, Columbus, OH, USA","University of California Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Prabal Dutta","id":"37429446700"},{"name":"M.

This application posed unique functional, usability, scalability, and robustness requirements which could not be met with existing hardware, and therefore motivated the design of a new platform. The detection and classification requirements are met using infrared, magnetic, and acoustic sensors. The infrared and acoustic sensors are designed for low-power continuous operation and include asynchronous processor wakeup circuitry. The usability and scalability requirements are met by minimizing the frequency and cost of human-in-the-loop operations during node deployment, activation, and verification through improvements in the user interface, packaging, and configurability of the platform. Recoverable retasking is addressed by using a grenade timer that periodically forces a system reset.

Small sized bumps were realized by electrodeposition using one lithographic mask for electrodepositing the UBM and the solder. The bilayer UBM consists of an electrodeposited Ni and Cu layer (Ni/sub ed/, Cu/sub ed/) on a sputtered Cu seedlayer (Cu/sub sp/) and a sputtered TiWN diffusion barrier. The Cu/sub ed/ layer is situated between solder and the Ni/sub ed/ layer and is suitable to act as a sacrificial layer forming a diffusion barrier layer between Ni and the solder. This barrier layer avoids or decreases the degradation of the Ni/sub ed/ layer during solid or liquid phase reaction with the solder. Rules for a proper design of the Cu layer thickness are deduced taking into account the solubility of Cu in the solder material as well as the formation and growth of intermetallic phases between solder and UBM. Electrodeposition of the UBM is suitable to realize small sized bump sizes up to 50 /spl mu/m diameter.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Effect of the Cu thickness on the stability of a Ni/Cu bilayer UBM of lead free microbumps during liquid and solid state aging","publicationTitle":"Proceedings Electronic Components and Technology, 2005.

The need for miniaturization has led to new system in package architectures, which combine disparate technologies. When several dies have to be connected in a small package, stacking appears to be the best solution. However, this 3D packaging has to satisfy high interconnection density, high data throughput with good signal integrity, and reliability needs while keeping a low cost. New developments on wafer level packaging and 3D packaging are in progress in a European project called Walpack (PIDEA project n/spl deg/ 01-131). The aim of this project is to develop equipment and processes for smart card, RF communications and 3D system in package. This paper is mainly focused on two different 3D packaging approaches proposed respectively by 3D-PLUS and Thales: ultra-thin 3D module; stacking of multi chip module with integrated passives. The major interest is to base process packaging at wafer level. Both the first results on packaging concepts and the first electrical results are presented and commented in this paper.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ECTC.2005.1441291","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31024","startPage":"356","endPage":"361 Vol. 1","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings Electronic Components and Technology, 2005.

Prediction of drop and shock survivability is largely beyond the state-of-art. However, the use of experimental approach to test out every possible design variation, and identify the one that gives the maximum design margin is often not feasible because of product development cycle time and cost constraints. Presently, one of the primary methodologies for evaluating shock and vibration survivability of electronic packaging is the JEDEC drop test method, JESD22-B111 which tests board-level reliability of packaging. However, packages in electronic products may be subjected to a wide-array of boundary conditions beyond those targeted in the test method. In this paper, a failure-envelope approach based on wavelet transforms and damage proxies has been developed to model drop and shock survivability of electronic packaging. Data on damage progression under transient-shock and vibration in both 95.5Sn4.0Ag0.5Cu and 63Sn37Pb ball-grid arrays has been presented. Component types examined include flex-substrate and rigid substrate ball-grid arrays. Dynamic measurements like acceleration, strain and resistance are measured and analyzed using highspeed data acquisition system capable of capturing in-situ strain, continuity and acceleration data in excess of 5 million samples per second. Ultra high-speed video at 150,000 fps per second has been used to capture the deformation kinematics. The concept of relative damage index has been used to both evaluate and predict damage progression during transient shock. The failure-envelope provides a fundamental basis for development of component integration guidelines to ensure survivability in shock and vibration environments at a user-specified confidence level. The approach is scalable to application at system-level. Explicit finite-element models have been developed for prediction of shock survivability based on the failure envelope. Model predictions have been correlated with experimental data for both leaded and leadfree ball-grid arrays","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"May 31 2005-June 3 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1441309/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"8598379","publicationDate":"2005","conferenceDate":"31 May-3 June 2005","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1441309/","dateOfInsertion":"20 June 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Failure-Envelope Approach to Modeling Shock and Vibration Survivability of Electronic and MEMS Packaging","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Failure-Envelope Approach to Modeling Shock and Vibration Survivability of Electronic and MEMS Packaging","confLoc":"Lake Buena Vista, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"01441309.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073756S","chronDate":"May 31 2005-June 3 2005","xplore-pub-id":"9844","isNumber":"31024","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9844","citationCount":"59","xplore-issue":"31024","articleId":"1441309","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":1441315,"authors":[{"name":"A.

Si/glass and glass/glass wafers were activated by the oxygen RIE plasma and nitrogen microwave radicals one after another. The activated wafers by the two-step process were brought into contact in air followed by keeping them in air for 24 h. The wafers were bonded throughout the entire area and the bonding strength of the interface was as strong as silicon and glass bulk without any post-annealing process and wet chemical cleaning steps. Bonding strength considerably increased with the nitrogen radical treatment after oxygen RIE activation prior to bonding. Chemical reliability tests showed that the bonded interfaces were significantly worked with various chemicals. Si/glass and glass/glass cavities formed by the sequential plasma activation process indicated hermetic sealing behavior. High bonding strength was thought to be due to a diffusion of absorbing water into wafer surface and a reaction between silicon oxynitride layers on the mating wafers. An amorphous layer of 7 nm thick was found at the Si/Si interface. Activation with N/sub 2/ radical for 1200 s after O/sub 2/ RIE plasma treatment for 60 s generated a new phase in the Si wafers across the amorphous layer, probably due to the implantation effect of N2 radical in Si wafer. T-shape microfluidics channels were fabricated on glass wafers by bulk micromachining and bonded by using the sequential plasma activation process at room temperature.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings Electronic Components and Technology, 2005.

Additional dwell time will not produce additional damage beyond a limit or boundary. However, our experiments consistently showed that the fatigue life of the lead-free solder balls decreases significantly when the dwell time increases from 15 minutes, to 30 minutes and until 90 minutes. Further failure analysis confirms that the failure mode and failure location is same when dwell time changes. The longer dwell time is, the more accumulated creep damage is. The results imply that it takes long time to entirely achieve the relaxation for the lead-free solder material. In addition, results also showed that the lead-free solder joint during thermal shock fails faster than thermal cycling. The faster ramp rate does impose more damage on solder joint than a slow ramp rate. It is concluded that the ramp time and dwell time have conflicting effects on solder joint reliability. Finite element analysis is conducted to have a fundamental understanding of the effects of ramp rate and dwell time on lead-free alloys. A remarkable agreement on the correlation between the finite element analysis and experimental results was achieved. The numerical results revealed the failure mechanism of solder joint associated with the ramp rate and dwell time. Thermal shock has a much faster ramp rate, thus imposing much more damage to the solder joints than thermal cycling. In that sense, the fatigue life decreased when the frequency increased. However, a longer dwell time causes more creep in the solder joint, thereby lowering the fatigue life significantly. This means that fatigue life decreases when frequency decreases. It can be concluded that frequency as a single parameter for a reliability model doesn't account for the conflicting effects of ramp rate and dwell time. The finite element results also show that the majority of damage occurs during the ramp period. The dwell time at high temperature is predicted to have a negligible contribution to the total inelastic strain energy density","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Environmentally friendly manufacturing techniques","Lead","Soldering","Packaging","Fatigue","Finite element methods","Frequency","Failure analysis","Creep","Electric shock"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ball grid arrays","failure analysis","finite element analysis","flip-chip devices","solders"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dwell time","ramp rate","lead-free solder joints","FCBGA packages","flip chip ball grid array","eutectic solder","fatigue life","lead-free solder balls","failure analysis","failure mode","failure location","creep damage","thermal shock","thermal cycling","ramp time","solder joint reliability","finite element analysis","lead-free alloys.","inelastic strain energy density"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ECTC.2005.1441379","publicationTitle":"Proceedings Electronic Components and Technology, 2005.

Electrical through-vias, high speed wiring and a through cavity for housing optoelectronic (OE) devices are critical features of the silicon carrier that allow high density integration of optical and electrical components on a single substrate, resulting in a small form factor system that is capable of meeting high bandwidth requirements of large computing systems. A novel hierarchical approach involving eutectic AuSn and SnPb solder systems and flip chip bonding technology is used to assemble the transceiver module. The optical system used for coupling light from the OE devices to waveguides is based on a relay lens that is integrated into the OE array. The measurement and model for alignment tolerance analysis showed constant coupling efficiency from the OE to waveguide over a range of plusmn 10 mum, giving an excellent margin for alignment. Electrical simulations and measurement of silicon carrier through-vias showed an insertion loss of better than 1 dB at 20 GHz. Simulations and measurements also exhibited an attenuation of 4.3 dB/cm at 20 GHz for high speed wiring on the silicon carrier, which was adequate for 20 Gbps data transmission over a channel length of 7 mm","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings Electronic Components and Technology, 2005.

These VCSEL devices have 4, 9, or 16 simultaneously driven spots - similar to a single spot VCSEL and have a single cone-shaped far field pattern (FFP) under high optical output power operations at 10, 20 and 40mW. Since the multispots are driven simultaneously, these devices have a high optical output power even if the optical output power from each spot is small. As a result, the mean time to failure (MTTF) obtained from a 4 spot multimode 850nm VCSEL array is well over 1,000,000 hrs at 70/spl deg/C under a 10mW operation. The VCSEL arrays also show a wide-open 2.5Gbps eye diagram at standard driving conditions - more than sufficient for optical free space communications such as optical wireless HDTV transmission systems. The simultaneously driven 9 and 16 spot multimode 850nm VCSEL arrays also show similar wide-open 2.5Gbps eye diagrams under standard driving conditions. Simultaneously driven multispot VCSEL arrays are useful as light sources for free space optics (FSO) because of their high speed modulation and high reliability under high optical output power operation.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings Electronic Components and Technology, 2005.

To construct the model it is fundamental to compute the dense point-to-point alignments among the prototypic faces acquired by Cyberware scanner. The proposed mesh resampling method overcome the alignments by the same resampling criterion to all prototypes. From the aligning prototypes the linear combination facial model is constructed. Matching the model to given facial image, the 3D face would be built automatically. To accelerate the model matching and expand the model fitting complex illumination, the multiresolution model and multilight model are designed. Although sharing the basic idea with the morphable model, the combination model has innovations in alignment strategy and illumination model. The experimental results show that the combination model have good performance in 3D face modelling.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Prototypes","Facial animation","Image motion analysis","Humans","Face","Optical computing","Software prototyping","PROM","Acceleration","Computer graphics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["face recognition","image sampling","image matching","image resolution","image morphing","image reconstruction","solid modelling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3D facial combination model","mesh resampling","facial image synthesis","Cyberware scanner","illumination model","image reconstruction","image matching"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICOSP.2004.1441547","publicationTitle":"Proceedings 7th International Conference on Signal Processing, 2004.

The proposed approach is based on using a single hidden layer wavelet neural network (WNN) to approximate complex nonlinear reflectance map functions in which example data are not explicitly given. The shape from shading problem is formulated as the minimization of an intensity error function with respect to the network weights. Due to the properties of the WNN, the representation of network topology can be definitely developed, and the training problem can be transformed into a convex optimization process, the global minimum can be obtained and the learning speed also increases. Experimental results on synthetic images demonstrate the new algorithm has performed well and compared favorably to the traditional ones.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"31 Aug.-4 Sept. 2004","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1441562/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"8426653","isConference":true,"volume":"2","htmlLink":"/document/1441562/","publicationDate":"2004","dateOfInsertion":"27 June 2005","conferenceDate":"31 Aug.-4 Sept. 2004","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A wavelet neural network approach for shape from shading","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A wavelet neural network approach for shape from shading","confLoc":"Beijing","sourcePdf":"01441562.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054302S","chronDate":"31 Aug.-4 Sept. 2004","xplore-pub-id":"9834","isNumber":"30994","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9834","xplore-issue":"30994","articleId":"1441562","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":1441583,"authors":[{"name":"Liu Fang","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Technology, Xidian University, Xi'an, China"],"lastName":"Liu Fang","id":"37417288300"},{"name":"Li Chaoyang","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Technology, Xidian University, Xi'an, China"],"lastName":"Li Chaoyang","id":"37415815500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-8406-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"1441583","dbTime":"25 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":57},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Face recognition","Costs","Support vector machines","Support vector machine classification","Testing","Principal component analysis","Fingerprint recognition","Speech recognition","Neural networks","Feature extraction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["face recognition","self-organising feature maps","support vector machines","feature extraction","image classification"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiview face recognition","frontal mid profile view","SOM","self-organizing map","MC","minor component","feature extraction","immune clonal selection algorithm","trough rotation transformation","SVM","support vector machine"]}],"abstract":"The profile view of a face provides a complementary information, it is very important to face recognition.

A new pulse-noise-reducing approach based on the open operation of unit-linking PCNN is proposed in this paper. The results of computer simulations show that the visual effects of retrieval images of binary pulse-noise images based on the open operation of unit-linking PCNN are better than those based on the median filter, a tradition approach for reducing image pulse noise. For binary images polluted by any other kinds of noise, such as white Guassian noise, after having turned the original noisy images into binary noisy images, using the approach proposed in this paper also can reduce the noise.

The WCDMA uplink signal model is established. Considering that channel parameter estimation in the pilot symbols which are far away from or near to data symbols have different effects on channel parameter of data symbols, weighted least square method is proposed to estimate channel parameter of data symbols. A novel adaptive channel estimation method based on weighted least squares (AWLS) is presented in this paper to meet simultaneously the needs of high speed, low speed, medium speed and varying-speed and the weighed combination function is introduced to solve this problem. Weight factor is determined by channel changing rate or maximum Doppler frequency. The method of the channel changing rate estimation is proposed in this paper and it has many advantages, such as small calculation and robust characteristic. The simulation results reveal that AWLS can track and estimate channel parameter of data symbol and RAKE receiver with AWLS method can perform well under high speed, medium speed, low mobile speed and varying-speed.","doi":"10.1109/ICOSP.2004.1441661","publicationTitle":"Proceedings 7th International Conference on Signal Processing, 2004.

Although accurate estimation of a channel of known length (i.e. channel impulse response duration) can be obtained with conventional estimators, very few studies have been focused on the simplification of the ML and MMSE algorithms. Conventional channel estimators preset a fixed length for the channel. The knowledge of the channel length would, in principle, reduce the complexity of the ML and MMSE estimators. This is of particular interests for OFDM systems, due to the excessive matrix manipulation involved, when the channel duration and training sequence are very long. Hence, the complexity of channel estimation is of crucial importance, especially for time-varying channels, where it has to be performed periodically or even continuously. In order to simplify the OFDM channel estimator, a channel length estimation technique based on second order statistics of the received signal is proposed. No preamble and preliminary channel estimate are needed by the proposed technique. Analysis and simulation results will show that the channel length estimator is very robust to frequency offset.","doi":"10.1109/ICOSP.2004.1441673","publicationTitle":"Proceedings 7th International Conference on Signal Processing, 2004.

The ADML has perfect performance and is as good as the performance lower bounds. The performance of DD algorithm depends directly on the accuracy of decision, so it's good for high SNR, but suffers when the SNR is low and especially, less than 0 dB. The new blind SNR estimation algorithm has good performance and low computational complexity for M=2(BPSK), but the performance degrades when M is increasing. The brief performance analysis, computer simulation and performance comparing with other SNR estimation algorithms are also given in this paper.","doi":"10.1109/ICOSP.2004.1441681","publicationTitle":"Proceedings 7th International Conference on Signal Processing, 2004.

The neuro-genetic design methodology is composed of two stages. Stage one consists of the development of an accurate neural network model for the microwave filters from the measured data. This model can be used to perform sensitivity analysis and derive response surfaces. In the second stage, the neural network model is used in conjunction with genetic algorithms to synthesize millimeter wave devices with desired electrical specifications. The synthesis methodology uses an accurate model that accounts for the manufacturing variations and parameter indeterminacy issues. Furthermore, the genetic synthesis algorithm uses a priority scheme to account for tradeoffs among various electrical characteristics to provide the best design. This method has been used to synthesize mm-wave low pass and band pass filters. The electrical response obtained from the layout parameters predicted by the method matches the desired electrical characteristics within 5%. The generic nature of the technique suggests potential extension to other mm-wave front ends, such as antennas, diplexers and baluns.","doi":"10.1109/ECTC.2005.1442040","startPage":"1802","endPage":"1806 Vol. 2","publicationTitle":"Proceedings Electronic Components and Technology, 2005.

The basic idea is to use periodic scrambling instead of the conventional pseudo-random scrambling. The period of the scrambling code can either be the same or different from that of the channelization code. Each user can be assigned a specific pair of channelization code and scrambling sequence to modulate its message signal. The overall system is therefore a \"structured long code system\", existing short code, long code and semilong code systems are all special cases of the proposed scheme. In this paper, following the system modeling, channel estimation and signal separation are presented for both uplink and downlink periodically scrambled CDMA. The proposed framework potentially can provide more flexibility in mobile management and cross-layer optimization for broadband access multimedia systems.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A generalized framework - periodically scrambled CDMA","publicationTitle":"Proceedings 7th International Conference on Signal Processing, 2004.

Accurate modeling of the angular probability density function (pdf) of the incoming multipath is essential for accurate prediction of the correlation and, hence, the MIMO capacity. Previous studies were limited to the case of single-cluster distribution or uniform pdf. Measurements indicate that multipath often arrives in several angular clusters and with non-uniform angular cluster pdf. We begin with the popular single cluster model and extend it to the case of multi-cluster channel. The single cluster model with various cluster pdfs is studied in both the angular domain and the angular spectrum domain (u-domain). Using Fourier transform techniques, it is shown that the spatial correlation is the inverse Fourier transform of a scaled and shifted version of the cluster pdf in the u-domain. We further prove that the spatial correlations for all the pdfs is roughly the same given the same angular spread. It is shown that the correlation in the two clusters channel has an oscillatory behavior as antenna spacing increases regardless of multipath AOA distributions; the envelope of the correlation is determined by the single cluster angular spread while the oscillations within the envelope are determined by the inter-cluster angular spread. The cluster angular pdf has negligible impact on the MIMO capacity and, hence, simpler uniform model can be used without degradation in accuracy.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MIMO capacity of multipath-clustered channels using Fourier transform techniques","publicationTitle":"Proceedings 7th International Conference on Signal Processing, 2004.

By beamforming, the signal-to-interference-ratio (SIR) increases which results in a lower BER in the initial stage of PIC. For in-beam multiple access interference (MAI) reduction, a nonlinear adaptive PIC with gradient adaptive step size is introduced based on a modified normalized least mean square (MNLMS) algorithm. The computational complexity of the approach is linear with the number of the active users. Simulation results show the excellent performance of the proposed scheme in comparison with the existed linear ST-MMSE receiver.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings 7th International Conference on Signal Processing, 2004.

Compared with the traditional OFDM system, the CL-UWB/OFDM approach has several distinct characteristics. Firstly, the time-domain signals generated by IDFT are real rather than complex value due to the conjugate symmetry relationship of the frequency-domain signals. Secondly, a train of extremely short pulses instead of a sinusoidal carrier is employed to convey information. Thirdly, the received signals are orderly sampled through multiple parallel branches by exploiting the feature that the pulse repetition period is much larger than the duration of each pulse. Finally, the signals of each branch are independent of that of the other branches. Hence, these branches resemble the multiple fading-independent antennas in classical narrow-band systems. Due to the above properties, the CL-UWB/OFDM system has not only all virtues of the traditional OFDM system, such as resistance to multipath interference and narrow-band interference, but also other advantages, for instance, excellent immunity to fading and frequency offset, simpler transceiver, and low power spectral density.","doi":"10.1109/ICOSP.2004.1442093","publicationTitle":"Proceedings 7th International Conference on Signal Processing, 2004.

In order to eliminate ISL, the paper presents an equalizer that can be used in WCDMA systems. The equalizer uses the knowledge on the channel impulse response (CIR), which can be provided by a separate channel estimator. The channel estimator adopts the iterative channel estimation, and it is able to estimate CIR for each burst separately by exploiting the known transmitted bits and the corresponding received samples. The equalizer is demonstrated by computer simulations that the error between the input and the output can be converged when the iterative time increases.","doi":"10.1109/ICOSP.2004.1442100","publicationTitle":"Proceedings 7th International Conference on Signal Processing, 2004.

We show that if the learning parameters are set appropriately, a RBFN trained on a small number of samples corrupted by perception noise can still lead to high reaching accuracy.

Path crossing of unreliable regions generates a drastic error that propagates to all the subsequent integration points [R.M. Goldstein et al., July 1988]. Therefore, it is necessary to first isolate the unreliable regions. Then using the branch-cut method, we can retrieve the absolute phase in the largest reliable region. Finally, the unwrapped phases within all the remaining regions are computed via the FEM. which can easily handle any irregular shape problem domain.

First, a previous blind watermarking technique is adopted to be robust to image compression. Then the extracted watermark is used to determine whether the watermarked image has been modified or not. If the image has been modified, the proposed sequential watermark alignment (SWA) and the morphological region growing (MRG) methods are used to find the tamper parts and determine the tampered region, respectively. Simulation results verify that several kinds of tampering effects in images can be correctly and efficiently detected by the proposed methods.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=30995","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICOSP.2004.1442247","publicationTitle":"Proceedings 7th International Conference on Signal Processing, 2004.

Although LN modulators display a high-power handling capability with controlled chirp over a large optical bandwidth (i.e., full C-band), they are relatively large and expensive to manufacture when compared to semiconductor devices. By contrast, InP-based electro-absorption modulators (EAMs) are much more compact; however they have a limited bandwidth (5-10 nm) over which chirp is in the correct range to allow > 80 km reach. This paper presents the broadband electro-absorption modulator (BEAM) chip concept, which consists of monolithically integrating a series of EAMs using quantum well intermixing with each one tuned to give the correct chirp over a certain wavelength range. The total bandwidth of the device is thus extended to cover the whole C-band. In addition, a semiconductor optical amplifier (SOA) is serially integrated with the EAMs to recover the insertion loss due to fiber coupling and the series of EAMs. A unique quantum well intermixing (QWI) process is the method employed to achieve the monolithic integration of the multiple sections required for the BEAM chip. Key results reported here are open 10 Gb/s eye diagrams of the integrated EAMs along with data from the demo BEAM chips showing the achievement of >10 dB extinction ratio across the C-band, with >35 km reach.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=30998","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIPRM.2004.1442741","publicationTitle":"16th IPRM. 2004 International Conference on Indium Phosphide and Related Materials, 2004.","displayPublicationTitle":"16th IPRM. 2004 International Conference on Indium Phosphide and Related Materials, 2004.","pdfPath":"/iel5/9837/30998/01442741.pdf","startPage":"403","endPage":"406","doi":"10.1109/ICIPRM.2004.1442741","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Monolithic integration of InGaAs/InAlGaAs-based semiconductor optical amplifiers and 10 Gb/s broadband electro-absorption modulators using quantum well intermixing technology","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"31 May-4 June 2004","displayDocTitle":"Monolithic integration of InGaAs/InAlGaAs-based semiconductor optical amplifiers and 10 Gb/s broadband electro-absorption modulators using quantum well intermixing technology","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"31 May-4 June 2004","htmlLink":"/document/1442741/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2004","accessionNumber":"8412671","dateOfInsertion":"18 July 2005","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1442741/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Monolithic integration of InGaAs/InAlGaAs-based semiconductor optical amplifiers and 10 Gb/s broadband electro-absorption modulators using quantum well intermixing technology","confLoc":"Kagoshima, Japan","sourcePdf":"01442741.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.035398S","chronDate":"31 May-4 June 2004","xplore-pub-id":"9837","isNumber":"30998","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9837","xplore-issue":"30998","articleId":"1442741","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":1442860,"authors":[{"name":"S.R. de Gauna","affiliation":["University of Basque Country (UPV-EHU), Bilbao, Spain","Department of Electronics and Telecommunications, Faculty of Engineering Alameda, BILBAO, Spain"],"firstName":"S.R.","lastName":"de Gauna","id":"37426556700"},{"name":"A.

The method put forward in the present work exploits the regularity observed in the coefficients of the continuous wavelet transform (CWT) of a VT segment. In a preliminary stage the wavelet analyzing function yielding the best results is selected. The ECG records are then divided in segments of 4.8 seconds where the CWT coefficients are calculated for those scales considered significant. The separation of the peaks in the time evolution of the coefficients is proportional to the cardiac frequency and the amplitude of the peaks is more uniform as the rhythm becomes more regular. The discrimination parameters selected for the algorithm are based on the dispersion of the position and the amplitude of those peaks. The accuracy achieved, 94.74%, improves the results obtained by previously reported methods.","doi":"10.1109/CIC.2004.1442860","publicationTitle":"Computers in Cardiology, 2004","displayPublicationTitle":"Computers in Cardiology, 2004","pdfPath":"/iel5/9836/30997/01442860.pdf","startPage":"21","endPage":"24","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CIC.2004.1442860","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=30997","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Discrimination between ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation using the continuous wavelet transform","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1442860","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-22 Sept. 2004","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1442860/","displayDocTitle":"Discrimination between ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation using the continuous wavelet transform","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2004","accessionNumber":"8412831","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1442860/","conferenceDate":"19-22 Sept. 2004","dateOfInsertion":"11 July 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Discrimination between ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation using the continuous wavelet transform","confLoc":"Chicago, IL, USA","sourcePdf":"01442860.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.109325S","chronDate":"19-22 Sept. 2004","xplore-pub-id":"9836","isNumber":"30997","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9836","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"30997","articleId":"1442860","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1442896,"authors":[{"name":"H.

This paper presents a method that aims to derive the standard 12-lead ECG from a pseudoorthogonal 3-lead subset via a nonlinear patient specific reconstruction method that is based on the use of artificial neural networks (ANN). We train and test the ANN over a 300 adult patients study population. We then assess the performance of the ANN based ECG synthesis method in comparison with the multiple regression based method and test for statistical differences between the two methods using the paired Student's t-test. The ANNs achieved high overall accuracies for all the testing sets. Moreover, the difference in accuracies between both methods is statistically significant (p<0.001). The encouraging results reported here suggest that the artificial neural networks represent a rather interesting and very promising approach to improve the synthesis of the 12-lead ECG.","doi":"10.1109/CIC.2004.1442896","startPage":"161","endPage":"164","displayPublicationTitle":"Computers in Cardiology, 2004","pdfPath":"/iel5/9836/30997/01442896.pdf","publicationTitle":"Computers in Cardiology, 2004","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CIC.2004.1442896","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=30997","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A neural network approach for patient-specific 12-lead ECG synthesis in patient monitoring environments","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Electrocardiography","Network synthesis","Intelligent networks","Patient monitoring","Artificial neural networks","Testing","Cardiology","Reconstruction algorithms","Myocardium"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electrocardiography","patient monitoring","neural nets","learning (artificial intelligence)","regression analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["12-lead ECG synthesis","patient monitoring environment","pseudoorthogonal 3-lead subset","nonlinear patient specific reconstruction method","artificial neural network","ANN","neural net training","multiple regression","Student's t-test"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1442896/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-22 Sept. 2004","displayDocTitle":"A neural network approach for patient-specific 12-lead ECG synthesis in patient monitoring environments","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1442896/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2004","dateOfInsertion":"11 July 2005","conferenceDate":"19-22 Sept. 2004","accessionNumber":"8412854","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A neural network approach for patient-specific 12-lead ECG synthesis in patient monitoring environments","confLoc":"Chicago, IL, USA","sourcePdf":"01442896.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039179S","chronDate":"19-22 Sept. 2004","xplore-pub-id":"9836","isNumber":"30997","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9836","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"30997","articleId":"1442896","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":1442952,"authors":[{"name":"R.V.

We show that this process cannot be carried out in a black-box way by a circuit of depth d and size 2/sup o(k2/d)/ or by a nondeterministic circuit of size o(k/log k) (and arbitrary depth). In particular, for k = 2/sup /spl Omega/(n)/, such hardness amplification cannot be done in ATIME(O(1), 2/sup o(n)/. Therefore, hardness amplification in general requires a high complexity.

Given as an oracle any algorithm which agrees with f' on (1 - /spl delta//sup k/)/2 fraction of the input, we still need an additional advice of length /spl Omega/(k log(1//spl delta/)) in order to compute f correctly on (1 - /spl delta/)/2 fraction of the input. Therefore, to guarantee the hardness, even against uniform machines, of the function f', one has to start with a function f which is hard against non-uniform circuits. Finally, we derive similar lower bounds for any black-box construction of pseudorandom generators from hard functions.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31036","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCC.2005.17","publicationTitle":"20th Annual IEEE Conference on Computational Complexity (CCC'05)","displayPublicationTitle":"20th Annual IEEE Conference on Computational Complexity (CCC'05)","pdfPath":"/iel5/9851/31036/01443084.pdf","startPage":"170","endPage":"182","doi":"10.1109/CCC.2005.17","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the complexity of hardness amplification","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-15 June 2005","displayDocTitle":"On the complexity of hardness amplification","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"11-15 June 2005","htmlLink":"/document/1443084/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8588088","dateOfInsertion":"27 June 2005","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1443084/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the complexity of hardness amplification","confLoc":"San Jose, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"01443084.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.104944S","chronDate":"11-15 June 2005","xplore-pub-id":"9851","isNumber":"31036","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9851","xplore-issue":"31036","articleId":"1443084","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":1443087,"authors":[{"name":"R.

Examples are Arthur-Merlin games and approximate counting and sampling of NP-witnesses. The goal of this paper is to derandomize such procedures under the weakest possible assumptions. Our main technical contribution allows one to \"boost\" a given hardness assumption. One special case is a proof that EXP /spl nsube/ NP/poly /spl rArr/ EXP /spl nsube/ P/sub /spl par///sup NP//poly. In words, if there is a problem in EXP that cannot be computed by poly-size nondeterministic circuits then there is one which cannot be computed by poly-size circuits that make non-adaptive NP oracle queries. This in particular shows that the various assumptions used over the last few years by several authors to derandomize Arthur-Merlin games (i.e., show AM = NP) are in fact all equivalent. In addition to simplifying the framework of AM derandomization, we show that this \"unified assumption\" suffices to de-randomize several other probabilistic procedures. For these results we define two new primitives that we regard as the natural pseudorandom objects associated with approximate counting and sampling of NP-witnesses. We use the \"boosting\" theorem and hashing techniques to construct these primitives using an assumption that is no stronger than that used to derandomize AM. As a consequence, under this assumption, there are deterministic polynomial time algorithms that use non-adaptive NP-queries and perform the following tasks: 1) approximate counting of NP-witnesses: given a Boolean circuit A, output r such that (1 - /spl epsi/)|A/sup -1/(1)| /spl les/ r les; |A/sup -1/(1)|. 2) pseudorandom sampling of NP-witnesses: given a Boolean circuit A, produce a polynomial-size sample space that is computationally indistinguishable from the uniform distribution over A/sup -1/(1). We also present applications. For example, we observe that Cai's proof that S/sub 2//sup p/ /spl sube/ ZPP/sup NP/ and the learning algorithm of Bshouty et al. can be seen as reductions to sampling that are not probabilistic. As a consequence they can be derandomized under the assumption stated above, which is weaker than the assumption that was previously known to suffice.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31036","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCC.2005.26","publicationTitle":"20th Annual IEEE Conference on Computational Complexity (CCC'05)","displayPublicationTitle":"20th Annual IEEE Conference on Computational Complexity (CCC'05)","pdfPath":"/iel5/9851/31036/01443087.pdf","startPage":"212","endPage":"226","doi":"10.1109/CCC.2005.26","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Pseudorandomness for approximate counting and sampling","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-15 June 2005","displayDocTitle":"Pseudorandomness for approximate counting and sampling","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"11-15 June 2005","htmlLink":"/document/1443087/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8588091","dateOfInsertion":"27 June 2005","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1443087/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Pseudorandomness for approximate counting and sampling","confLoc":"San Jose, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"01443087.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.096271S","chronDate":"11-15 June 2005","xplore-pub-id":"9851","isNumber":"31036","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9851","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"31036","articleId":"1443087","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1443093,"authors":[{"name":"R.

We show that the first message of P can be compressed to 0(k) classical bits using prior entanglement if it carries at most k bits of information about the sender's input. This implies a general direct sum result for one-round and simultaneous quantum protocols. It also implies a new round elimination lemma in quantum communication, which allows us to extend recent classical lower bounds on the cell probe complexity of some data structure problems, e.g. approximate nearest neighbor searching on the Hamming cube {0, 1}/sup n/, to the quantum setting. We then show an optimal tradeoff between the privacy losses of Alice and Bob in computing f in terms of the one-round quantum communication complexity of f with prior entanglement. This tradeoff is independent of the number of rounds of communication. The above message compression and privacy tradeoff results use a lot of qubits of prior entanglement, leading one to wonder how much prior entanglement is really required by a quantum protocol. We show that Newman's [1991] technique of reducing the number of public coins in a classical protocol cannot be lifted to the quantum setting. We do this by defining a general notion of black-box reduction of prior entanglement that subsumes Newman's technique. Intuitively, a black-box reduction does not change the unitary transforms of Alice and Bob; it only decreases the amount of entanglement of the prior entangled state. We prove that such a black-box reduction is impossible for quantum protocols by exhibiting a particular one-round quantum protocol for the equality function where the black-box technique fails to reduce the amount of prior entanglement by more than a constant factor.","displayPublicationTitle":"20th Annual IEEE Conference on Computational Complexity (CCC'05)","pdfPath":"/iel5/9851/31036/01443093.pdf","startPage":"285","endPage":"296","publicationTitle":"20th Annual IEEE Conference on Computational Complexity (CCC'05)","doi":"10.1109/CCC.2005.24","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCC.2005.24","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31036","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1443093","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Prior entanglement, message compression and privacy in quantum communication","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Privacy","Quantum entanglement","Protocols","Quantum computing","Complexity theory","Military computing","Probes","Data structures","Nearest neighbor searches","Paramagnetic resonance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["quantum communication","quantum computing","quantum entanglement","data compression","data privacy","communication complexity","cryptography","protocols"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["message compression","data privacy","two-party quantum communication protocol","prior entanglement","cell probe complexity","data structure","nearest neighbor searching","Hamming cube","privacy loss","communication complexity","privacy tradeoff","public coins","black-box reduction","unitary transforms","equality function"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1443093/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-15 June 2005","displayDocTitle":"Prior entanglement, message compression and privacy in quantum communication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1443093/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8588097","dateOfInsertion":"27 June 2005","conferenceDate":"11-15 June 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Prior entanglement, message compression and privacy in quantum communication","confLoc":"San Jose, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"01443093.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.092057S","chronDate":"11-15 June 2005","xplore-pub-id":"9851","isNumber":"31036","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9851","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"31036","articleId":"1443093","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":1443113,"authors":[{"name":"A.C.

First, a clear differentiation is made between photographic facial data and video-acquired facial data as being two different modalities: one providing hard biometrics, the other providing softer biometrics. Second, faces which have the resolution of at least 12 pixels between the eyes are shown to be recognizable by computers just as they are by humans. As a way to deal with low resolution and quality of each individual video frame, the paper offers to use the neuro-associative principle employed by human brain, according to which both memorization and recognition of data are done based on a flow of frames rather than on one frame: synaptic plasticity provides a way to memorize from a sequence, while the collective decision making over time is very suitable for recognition of a sequence. As a benchmark for FRiV approaches, the paper introduces the IIT-NRC video-based database of faces which consists of pairs of low-resolution video clips of unconstrained facial motions. The recognition rate of over 95%, which we achieve on this database, as well as the results obtained on real-time annotation of people on TV allow us to believe that the proposed framework brings us closer to the ultimate benchmark for the FRiV approaches, which is \"if you are able to recognize a person, so should the computer\".","doi":"10.1109/CRV.2005.87","startPage":"330","endPage":"338","displayPublicationTitle":"The 2nd Canadian Conference on Computer and Robot Vision (CRV'05)","pdfPath":"/iel5/9852/31037/01443149.pdf","publicationTitle":"The 2nd Canadian Conference on Computer and Robot Vision (CRV'05)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CRV.2005.87","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31037","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Video-based framework for face recognition in video","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Face recognition","Biometrics","Image recognition","Face detection","Eyes","Humans","Databases","Information technology","Councils","Decision making"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["face recognition","video streaming"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["video-based framework","face recognition","FRiV","photographic facial data","video-acquired facial data","biometrics","video frame","neuro-associative principle","data memorization","data recognition","synaptic plasticity","IIT-NRC video-based facial database","unconstrained facial motions","real-time annotation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1443149/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 May 2005","displayDocTitle":"Video-based framework for face recognition in video","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1443149/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2005","dateOfInsertion":"20 June 2005","conferenceDate":"9-11 May 2005","accessionNumber":"8564969","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Video-based framework for face recognition in video","confLoc":"Victoria, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"01443149.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071368S","chronDate":"9-11 May 2005","xplore-pub-id":"9852","isNumber":"31037","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9852","citationCount":"48","xplore-issue":"31037","articleId":"1443149","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1443206,"authors":[{"name":"F.

However, this is generally not sufficient to express security properties such as availability and obligations must be also considered. By contrast to permissions and prohibitions, obligations are often associated with deadlines to specify bounded time availability requirements. In this case, a violation only occurs if the obliged action is not performed before the deadline. On the other hand, when specifying high level security policies, it is convenient to consider abstract non atomic actions. Since most access control mechanisms only deal with atomic actions such as read or write, these non atomic actions must be decomposed into more basic ones. In this paper, we define a formal security model called Nomad to express privileges on non atomic actions. This model combines deontic and temporal logics. In Nomad, we model conditional privileges and obligations with deadlines. We also formally analyze how privileges on non atomic actions can be decomposed into more basic privileges on elementary actions.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Permission","Logic","Access control","Authorization","Data security","Availability","History","Concrete","Operating systems","Database systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["security of data","temporal logic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Nomad","nonatomic actions","nonatomic deadlines","security policies","formal security model","deontic logic","temporal logic"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31038","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CSFW.2005.20","startPage":"186","endPage":"196","publicationTitle":"18th IEEE Computer Security Foundations Workshop (CSFW'05)","displayPublicationTitle":"18th IEEE Computer Security Foundations Workshop (CSFW'05)","pdfPath":"/iel5/9853/31038/01443206.pdf","doi":"10.1109/CSFW.2005.20","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Nomad: a security model with non atomic actions and deadlines","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Nomad: a security model with non atomic actions and deadlines","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"8614975","publicationDate":"2005","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"20-22 June 2005","dateOfInsertion":"05 July 2005","htmlLink":"/document/1443206/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1443206/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 June 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Nomad: a security model with non atomic actions and deadlines","confLoc":"Aix-en-Provence, France","sourcePdf":"01443206.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.087244S","chronDate":"20-22 June 2005","xplore-pub-id":"9853","isNumber":"31038","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9853","citationCount":"36","xplore-issue":"31038","articleId":"1443206","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":1443228,"authors":[{"name":"M.

We pose the object recognition problem as one of finding consistent matches between all images, subject to the constraint that the images were taken from a perspective camera. We assume that the objects or scenes are rigid. For each image, we associate a camera matrix, which is parameterised by rotation, translation and focal length. We use invariant local features to find matches between all images, and the RANSAC algorithm to find those that are consistent with the fundamental matrix. Objects are recognised as subsets of matching images. We then solve for the structure and motion of each object, using a sparse bundle adjustment algorithm. Our results demonstrate that it is possible to recognise and reconstruct 3D objects from an unordered image database with no user input at all.","doi":"10.1109/3DIM.2005.81","publicationTitle":"Fifth International Conference on 3-D Digital Imaging and Modeling (3DIM'05)","displayPublicationTitle":"Fifth International Conference on 3-D Digital Imaging and Modeling (3DIM'05)","pdfPath":"/iel5/9854/31039/01443228.pdf","startPage":"56","endPage":"63","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/3DIM.2005.81","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31039","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Unsupervised 3D object recognition and reconstruction in unordered datasets","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1443228","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 June 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1443228/","displayDocTitle":"Unsupervised 3D object recognition and reconstruction in unordered datasets","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8588229","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1443228/","conferenceDate":"13-16 June 2005","dateOfInsertion":"27 June 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Unsupervised 3D object recognition and reconstruction in unordered datasets","confLoc":"Ottawa, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"01443228.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054783S","chronDate":"13-16 June 2005","xplore-pub-id":"9854","isNumber":"31039","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9854","citationCount":"103","xplore-issue":"31039","articleId":"1443228","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1443257,"authors":[{"name":"J.F.

One effective method is to classify points using features based on local point cloud distribution into surfaces, linear structures or clutter volumes. But the local features are computed using 3D points within a support-volume. Local and global point density variations and the presence of multiple manifolds make the problem of selecting the size of this support volume, or scale, challenging. In this paper, we adopt an approach inspired by recent developments in computational geometry (Mitra et al., 2005) and investigate the problem of automatic data-driven scale selection to improve point cloud classification. The approach is validated with results using data from different sensors in various environments classified into different terrain types (vegetation, solid surface and linear structure).","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Clouds","Computational geometry","Laser radar","Layout","Vegetation mapping","Robot sensing systems","Laser modes","Collaboration","Mobile robots","Navigation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["robot vision","image classification","computational geometry","mobile robots"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["point-sampled 3D surface classification","three-dimensional ladar data","outdoor mobile robots","local point cloud distribution","linear structures","clutter volumes","computational geometry","automatic data-driven scale selection"]}],"doi":"10.1109/3DIM.2005.71","publicationTitle":"Fifth International Conference on 3-D Digital Imaging and Modeling (3DIM'05)","displayPublicationTitle":"Fifth International Conference on 3-D Digital Imaging and Modeling (3DIM'05)","pdfPath":"/iel5/9854/31039/01443257.pdf","startPage":"285","endPage":"292","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31039","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/3DIM.2005.71","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Scale selection for classification of point-sampled 3D surfaces","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1443257","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Scale selection for classification of point-sampled 3D surfaces","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1443257/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2005","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1443257/","accessionNumber":"8588258","conferenceDate":"13-16 June 2005","dateOfInsertion":"27 June 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 June 2005","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Scale selection for classification of point-sampled 3D surfaces","confLoc":"Ottawa, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"01443257.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042315S","chronDate":"13-16 June 2005","xplore-pub-id":"9854","isNumber":"31039","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9854","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"31039","articleId":"1443257","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":1443307,"authors":[{"name":"C.J.

Flash memory is enjoying a rapid market growth. The research for flash memory testing is mainly to reduce the test cost and improve the production yield. In this paper, we propose a fault diagnosis flow for flash memory. We also propose a flexible built-in self-diagnosis (BISD) design with enhanced test mode control, which reduces the test time and diagnostic data shift-out cycles by using parallel programming and erasure and employing a parallel shift-out mechanism. The area overhead of our BISD circuit is only about 0.5% for a 256Mb commodity flash memory chip.

This paper proposes a novel technique, referred to as pre-discharge write test mode (PDWTM), that effectively integrates the testing of DRF within \"regular\" March algorithms such that the rate (speed) of the latter remains unaltered. That is, the PDWTM enables DRF testing without incurring the additional cycles or pauses in the March test execution thereby enabling additional coverage at no expense in terms of overall test time. We show that DRFs can be easily detected by pre-discharging bit lines before a write operation.

Random jitter is measured accurately even in the presence of deterministic and low-frequency periodic jitter, up to a cutoff frequency.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Jitter","Measurement techniques","Sampling methods","Testing","Bit error rate","Instruments","Frequency measurement","Time measurement","Test equipment","Cutoff frequency"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automatic test equipment","comparators (circuits)","peripheral interfaces","jitter","integrated circuit testing","signal sampling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["random jitter measurement","comparator sampling","automated test equipment","ATE","device validation","high-speed serial interfaces","data edge regions","data accumulation","periodic jitter"]}],"doi":"10.1109/VTS.2005.30","publicationTitle":"23rd IEEE VLSI Test Symposium (VTS'05)","displayPublicationTitle":"23rd IEEE VLSI Test Symposium (VTS'05)","pdfPath":"/iel5/9857/31042/01443409.pdf","startPage":"123","endPage":"130","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31042","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VTS.2005.30","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An efficient random jitter measurement technique using fast comparator sampling","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1443409","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"An efficient random jitter measurement technique using fast comparator sampling","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1443409/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2005","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1443409/","accessionNumber":"8496483","conferenceDate":"1-5 May 2005","dateOfInsertion":"20 June 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-5 May 2005","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An efficient random jitter measurement technique using fast comparator sampling","confLoc":"Palm Springs, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"01443409.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062725S","chronDate":"1-5 May 2005","xplore-pub-id":"9857","isNumber":"31042","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9857","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"31042","articleId":"1443409","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1443414,"authors":[{"name":"B.N.

(2) The same pattern, applied on different chips, results in different delays because of process variations. For structural delay testing, these pattern variations may result in difficulty for finding an optimal test clock setting, which may significantly impact the defect screening effectiveness. This paper investigates the possibility of applying statistical timing analysis techniques to reduce pattern variations for structural delay testing. We develop an efficient statistical pattern-based timing simulator and devise pattern selection algorithms for reducing such variations. By constructing pattern sets with smaller variations, we show that higher screening effectiveness can be achieved.

We analyze in detail the electrical origins of these faults, starting from the most common till those that lead to what we have called hard to detect DRFs. In general, DRFs are supposed to be produced by very high resistive-open defects that affect the refreshment loop of the core-cell. We demonstrate that lower values of resistance may produce hard to detect DRFs. Moreover, each resistive-open defect produces a particular faulty behavior of the core-cell that changes for different ranges of the resistive value. We analyze different cases and we propose for each one an efficient test procedure based on March tests. In particular, we propose to stimulate the defective cells in some cases by indirect accesses and in some other cases by emphasizing natural noise phenomenon of SRAM memories (such as the ground bounce).","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"1-5 May 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1443421/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1443421/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"8496489","conferenceDate":"1-5 May 2005","publicationDate":"2005","dateOfInsertion":"20 June 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Data retention fault in SRAM memories: analysis and detection procedures","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Data retention fault in SRAM memories: analysis and detection procedures","confLoc":"Palm Springs, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"01443421.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.092695S","chronDate":"1-5 May 2005","xplore-pub-id":"9857","isNumber":"31042","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9857","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"31042","articleId":"1443421","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1443422,"authors":[{"name":"J.C.

The MLDRAM uses reference and data cell signals that are generated in the cell array using charge sharing. The single-step sensing method uses multiple reference signals in parallel. Test chip characterization features include four cell sizes, two sense amplifier sizes, and bitline shields for half of the cells. New tests were developed based on an MLDRAM fault model. These include basic functionality, retention time, multilevel march, inter-bitline coupling, and cell-plate voltage bump tests. Our results show that the data and reference signals are generated correctly and that MLDRAM is possible for up to six signal levels.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Testing","Random access memory","Signal generators","Decoding","Voltage","Signal design","Prototypes","Circuit faults","Noise reduction","Circuit noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DRAM chips","CMOS memory circuits","integrated circuit testing","mixed analogue-digital integrated circuits","fault diagnosis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DRAM testing","DRAM characterization","variable-capacity multilevel DRAM","DRAM storage density","storage cells","mixed-signal CMOS","data signal levels","cell array","charge sharing","single-step sensing method","test chip characterization","bitline shields","MLDRAM fault model","MLDRAM functionality","retention time","multilevel march","interbitline coupling","cell-plate voltage bump test","0.18 micron","1.8 V","1 to 2.5 bit"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1443422","doi":"10.1109/VTS.2005.82","displayPublicationTitle":"23rd IEEE VLSI Test Symposium (VTS'05)","pdfPath":"/iel5/9857/31042/01443422.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VTS.2005.82","startPage":"189","endPage":"197","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31042","publicationTitle":"23rd IEEE VLSI Test Symposium (VTS'05)","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Test and characterization of a variable-capacity multilevel DRAM","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Test and characterization of a variable-capacity multilevel DRAM","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1443422/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"1-5 May 2005","conferenceDate":"1-5 May 2005","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1443422/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"20 June 2005","publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8496490","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Test and characterization of a variable-capacity multilevel DRAM","confLoc":"Palm Springs, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"01443422.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057261S","chronDate":"1-5 May 2005","xplore-pub-id":"9857","isNumber":"31042","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9857","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"31042","articleId":"1443422","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1443423,"authors":[{"name":"Chun-Chieh Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Chun-Chieh Wang","id":"37422650900"},{"name":"Jing-Jia Liou","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Jing-Jia Liou","id":"37273980200"},{"name":"Yen-Lin Peng","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Yen-Lin Peng","id":"37279371600"},{"name":"Chih-Tsun Huang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Chih-Tsun Huang","id":"37281272400"},{"name":"Cheng-Wen Wu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Cheng-Wen Wu","id":"37276423200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7695-2314-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1093-0167"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2375-1053"}],"articleNumber":"1443423","dbTime":"17 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":217},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Built-in self-test","Field programmable gate arrays","Circuit testing","Circuit faults","Integrated circuit interconnections","Clocks","Delay effects","Very large scale integration","Logic testing","Routing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","integrated circuit interconnections","integrated circuit testing","built-in self test","fault diagnosis","clocks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FPGA interconnect delay fault testing","BIST architecture","FPGA CLB arrays","test circuit","path delay conformance","target path configuration","test clock skew","guard bands"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we propose a new BIST-based approach for testing FPGA interconnect delay faults.

Different sensor structures are evaluated based on their performance in the presence of environmental effects and process shifts It is seen that very simple sensing circuitry can predict high quality alternate test for RF components.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Built-in self-test","Radio frequency","Feature extraction","Circuit testing","Packaging","Temperature sensors","Bandwidth","Hardware","Detectors","Frequency conversion"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["built-in self test","analogue-digital conversion","radiofrequency integrated circuits","electric sensing devices","feature extraction","digital signal processing chips"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["built-in test","RF components","mapped feature extraction sensors","alternate testing","A/D converter","digitized response","external tester","analog test response","response waveform"]}],"doi":"10.1109/VTS.2005.33","publicationTitle":"23rd IEEE VLSI Test Symposium (VTS'05)","displayPublicationTitle":"23rd IEEE VLSI Test Symposium (VTS'05)","pdfPath":"/iel5/9857/31042/01443430.pdf","startPage":"243","endPage":"248","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31042","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VTS.2005.33","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Built-in test of RF components using mapped feature extraction sensors","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1443430","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Built-in test of RF components using mapped feature extraction sensors","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1443430/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2005","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1443430/","accessionNumber":"8471793","conferenceDate":"1-5 May 2005","dateOfInsertion":"20 June 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-5 May 2005","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Built-in test of RF components using mapped feature extraction sensors","confLoc":"Palm Springs, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"01443430.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071753S","chronDate":"1-5 May 2005","xplore-pub-id":"9857","isNumber":"31042","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9857","citationCount":"34","xplore-issue":"31042","articleId":"1443430","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":1443431,"authors":[{"name":"A.

Production testing of EVM incurs high cost of test instrumentation in automated test equipment (ATE). For EVM testing of wireless receivers, the ATE must include an RF transmitter having (1) the required digital modulation capability, (2) transmitter parameter configurability via test automation software and (3) higher performance and accuracy compared to the receiver-under-test. In this paper, an alternate test methodology for the EVM specification is proposed that eliminates the need for high cost RF sources with digital modulation capability. A sequence of multi-tones generated using low-cost RF sources is used as test stimuli. The EVM specification is computed (predicted) by analyzing the degradation of the test signal by the receiver modules (e.g. LNAs, mixers, filters) by means of the observed waveforms in the baseband.

However, there remain two open issues that are yet to be resolved completely. First, in order to exploit fully the spatial diversity gains due to the use of directional antennas, it is essential to shift to the exclusive use of directional antennas for the transmission and reception of all the upper layers frames. This facilitates maximal spatial re-use and effaces the phenomenon of asymmetry in gain. Second, in the presence of mobility, the MAC protocol should incorporate mechanisms by which a node can efficiently locate and track its neighbors. We propose a new polling based MAC protocol that addresses both the issues in an integrated way. We perform analysis and extensive simulations to understand the performance of our scheme in terms of its ability to maintain connectivity, the achieved utilization efficiency, and throughput. We find that each node, on average, can achieve a per node utilization of about 80% in static and about 45% in mobile scenarios. Our protocol is seen to outperform both the traditional IEEE 802.11 MAC protocol and previously proposed protocols for use with directional antennas that provide partial solutions to solve the aforementioned problems. Finally, we also study the sensitivity of our protocol to various system parameters.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WOWMOM.2005.27","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31043","startPage":"11","endPage":"21","displayPublicationTitle":"Sixth IEEE International Symposium on a World of Wireless Mobile and Multimedia Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/9858/31043/01443480.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An integrated neighbor discovery and MAC protocol for ad hoc networks using directional antennas","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1443480/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 June 2005","htmlLink":"/document/1443480/","displayDocTitle":"An integrated neighbor discovery and MAC protocol for ad hoc networks using directional antennas","conferenceDate":"16-16 June 2005","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8598756","dateOfInsertion":"27 June 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An integrated neighbor discovery and MAC protocol for ad hoc networks using directional antennas","confLoc":"Taormina-Giardini Naxos, Italy","sourcePdf":"01443480.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047062S","chronDate":"13-16 June 2005","xplore-pub-id":"9858","isNumber":"31043","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9858","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"31043","articleId":"1443480","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1443488,"authors":[{"name":"M.M.

The majority of research in this area has focused on free-for-all, uncoordinated access methods common in ad-hoc military applications (Horne, W. 2003; Leaves, P. et al., 2002; Lehr, W. et al., 2002; Schafer, D.J.; To/spl uml/njes, R., 2002). We argue that a simpler pragmatic approach that offers coordinated, spatially aggregated spectrum access via a regional spectrum broker is more attractive in the immediate future. We first introduce two new concepts, coordinated access band (CAB) and statistically multiplexed access (SMA), to the spectrum. We describe their implementation in the new DIMSUMnet (dynamic intelligent management of spectrum for ubiquitous mobile-access network) architecture consisting of four elements: base stations; clients; a radio access network manager (RAN-MAN) that obtains spectrum leases; a per-domain spectrum broker that controls spectrum access. We also discuss in detail various issues in the design of spectrum brokers and spectrum allocation policies and algorithms.","doi":"10.1109/WOWMOM.2005.36","publicationTitle":"Sixth IEEE International Symposium on a World of Wireless Mobile and Multimedia Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"Sixth IEEE International Symposium on a World of Wireless Mobile and Multimedia Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/9858/31043/01443488.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WOWMOM.2005.36","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31043","startPage":"78","endPage":"85","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"DIMSUMnet: new directions in wireless networking using coordinated dynamic spectrum","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1443488","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"DIMSUMnet: new directions in wireless networking using coordinated dynamic spectrum","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 June 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1443488/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"16-16 June 2005","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8598764","dateOfInsertion":"27 June 2005","htmlLink":"/document/1443488/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"DIMSUMnet: new directions in wireless networking using coordinated dynamic spectrum","confLoc":"Taormina-Giardini Naxos, Italy","sourcePdf":"01443488.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064096S","chronDate":"13-16 June 2005","xplore-pub-id":"9858","isNumber":"31043","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9858","citationCount":"255","xplore-issue":"31043","articleId":"1443488","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":1443499,"authors":[{"name":"M.

CAR is a novel approach to the provision of asynchronous communication in partially-connected mobile ad hoc networks, based on the intelligent placement of messages. We discuss the details of the algorithm, and then present simulation results demonstrating that it is possible for nodes to exploit context information in making local decisions that lead to good delivery ratios and latencies with small overheads.","doi":"10.1109/WOWMOM.2005.17","publicationTitle":"Sixth IEEE International Symposium on a World of Wireless Mobile and Multimedia Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"Sixth IEEE International Symposium on a World of Wireless Mobile and Multimedia Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/9858/31043/01443499.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WOWMOM.2005.17","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31043","startPage":"183","endPage":"189","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive routing for intermittently connected mobile ad hoc networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1443499","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive routing for intermittently connected mobile ad hoc networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 June 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1443499/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"16-16 June 2005","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8598775","dateOfInsertion":"27 June 2005","htmlLink":"/document/1443499/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive routing for intermittently connected mobile ad hoc networks","confLoc":"Taormina-Giardini Naxos, Italy","sourcePdf":"01443499.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062316S","chronDate":"13-16 June 2005","xplore-pub-id":"9858","isNumber":"31043","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9858","citationCount":"177","xplore-issue":"31043","articleId":"1443499","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1443502,"authors":[{"name":"Jia Tang","affiliation":["Networking and Information Systems Laboratory, Department of Electrical Engineering, Texas A and M University, College Station, TX, USA"],"lastName":"Jia Tang","id":"37276757500"},{"name":"Xi Zhang","affiliation":["Networking and Information Systems Laboratory, Department of Electrical Engineering, Texas A and M University, College Station, TX, USA"],"lastName":"Xi Zhang","id":"37279333400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7695-2342-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"1443502","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":259},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cross layer design","Resource management","Wireless networks","Downlink","Physical layer","Adaptive arrays","Transmitting antennas","Real time systems","Delay","Throughput"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["quality of service","OFDM modulation","error statistics","resource allocation","MIMO systems","mobile radio","time division multiplexing","delays","optimisation","telecommunication congestion control","statistical analysis","DiffServ networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dynamic resource allocation","QoS guarantees","MIMO-OFDM wireless networks","PHY-MAC cross-layer scheme","heterogeneous mobile users","real-time users","nonreal-time users","PHY layer","MAC layer","transmit antennas","modulation levels","spectral efficiency","BER requirements","dynamic time-slot assignment","TDM","delays","FDM","admission control","differentiated services"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Wireless networks","resource allocation","Quality of Service (QoS)","cross-layer design and optimization","MIMO","OFDM","real-time audio and video","differentiated services"]}],"abstract":"We propose a PHY-MAC cross-layer based dynamic-resource allocation (DRA) scheme with diverse QoS guarantees for heterogeneous mobile users over MIMO-OFDM wireless network downlinks. Our scheme differentiates real-time users (e.g., audio/video) from non-real-time users (e.g., data). At the PHY layer, the DRA adaptively allocates transmit antennas and modulation levels for real- and non-real-time users to increase the spectral efficiency while guaranteeing the distinct BER-QoS requirements. Combining with the proposed PHY-layer infrastructure, the DRA at the MAC layer treats real- and non-real-time users differently: (1) it dynamically assigns time-slots for real-time users in a TDM-mode to guarantee the bounded delays; (2) it adaptively allocates subcarriers for non-real-time users in an FDM-mode to maximize the system throughput while retaining fairness among users. We analytically derive the admission-control and time-slot allocation conditions to guarantee the statistical delay-bound for real-time users using the effective bandwidth theory.

Most existing strategies control either power and scheduling, or rates and scheduling, but not all three together as we do. We assume the underlying physical layer is in the linear regime (the rate of a link can be approximated by a linear function of the signal-to-interference-and-noise ratio), as in time hopping UWB (TH-UWB) and low gain CDMA systems, and that it allows fine-grained rate adaptation, as in 802.11a/g, HDR/CDMA, TH-UWB. The goal is to find properties of the power control in an optimal joint design. Our main finding is that optimal power control is simple 0-P/sup MAX/ power control, i.e. when a node is sending it uses the maximum transmitting power allowed. We consider both high rate networks, where the goal is to maximize rates under power constraints, and low power networks, where the goal is to minimize average consumed power while meeting minimum rate constraints. We prove analytically that, in both scenarios, the optimal can always be attained with 0-P/sup MAX/ power allocation. Moreover, we prove that, when maximizing rates, and if power constraints are on peak and not average, 0-P/sup MAX/ is the only optimal power control strategy, and any other is strictly suboptimal.","displayPublicationTitle":"Sixth IEEE International Symposium on a World of Wireless Mobile and Multimedia Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/9858/31043/01443531.pdf","startPage":"417","endPage":"427","publicationTitle":"Sixth IEEE International Symposium on a World of Wireless Mobile and Multimedia Networks","doi":"10.1109/WOWMOM.2005.79","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WOWMOM.2005.79","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31043","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1443531","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Power control is not required for wireless networks in the linear regime","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power control","Wireless networks","Intelligent networks","Signal to noise ratio","Physical layer","Media Access Protocol","Processor scheduling","Multiaccess communication","Spread spectrum communication","Communication system control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power control","radio networks","scheduling","power consumption","optimisation","minimisation","telecommunication control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power control","wireless networks","linear regime","power adaptation","rate adaptation","scheduling","multi-hop wireless network","physical layer","signal-to-interference-and-noise ratio","SINR","time hopping UWB","CDMA","IEEE 802.11a","IEEE 802.11g","maximum transmitting power","high rate networks","low power networks","average power consumption minimization","power allocation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1443531/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-16 June 2005","displayDocTitle":"Power control is not required for wireless networks in the linear regime","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1443531/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8598807","dateOfInsertion":"27 June 2005","conferenceDate":"16-16 June 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power control is not required for wireless networks in the linear regime","confLoc":"Taormina-Giardini Naxos, Italy","sourcePdf":"01443531.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.124833S","chronDate":"16-16 June 2005","xplore-pub-id":"9858","isNumber":"31043","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9858","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"31043","articleId":"1443531","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":1443532,"authors":[{"name":"Lian Zhao","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, Ryerson University, Toronto, ONT, Canada"],"lastName":"Lian Zhao","id":"37279828100"},{"name":"J.W.

These must be solved in order to make a stable amplifier with high gain.","doi":"10.1109/PROC.1963.1667","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PROC.1963.1667","startPage":"120","endPage":"124","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5/31044/01443597.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31044","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An active interference filter as an optical maser amplifier","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1963","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1963","displayDocTitle":"An active interference filter as an optical maser amplifier","publicationDate":"Jan. 1963","dateOfInsertion":"28 June 2005","volume":"51","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1443597/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An active interference filter as an optical maser amplifier","sourcePdf":"01443597.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.03249S","chronDate":"Jan.  1963","isNumber":"31044","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"7","articleId":"1443597","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1963","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":1443599,"authors":[{"name":"I.P.

A modulation index of unity has been obtained with a modulation peak power of about 12 watts. This power level is independent of the bandwidth of the modulation. This is contrasted with known microwave amplitude light modulators which require peak modulation power in the kilowatts and exhibit bandwidths of the order of 30 Mc. The extremely wide bandwidth operation with the low modulation power is obtained by applying the modulation voltage to the electro-optic material by means of a traveling-wave structure of the transmission line type. The direction of propagation of the light and of the modulation are colinear and the transmission line is designed so that the light progresses through the crystal in synchronism with the modulation on the line. The magnitude of the angular modulation was determined by illuminating the modulator with a ruby laser and examining the individual spectral components of the output with an S-band traveling-wave microwave phototube receiver. Similar to the behavior of conventional FM systems, a minimum in the carrier at a modulation index of 3.75 was observed as well as the appearance of the appropriate sidebands. These experiments were performed at 30 Mc and 1 Gc. It appears that the bandwidth of the modulator should be several octaves greater than 1 Gc, but this was not determined experimentally for equipment reasons. The attenuation of the 1 Gc modulation through the modulator and the balun at either end was 2 db and the attenuation of the light through the electro-optic crystals was about 6 db. A good portion of this later loss undoubtedly occurred at the interfaces between crystals.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bandwidth","Phase modulation","Optical modulation","Electrooptic modulators","Amplitude modulation","Power transmission lines","Optical attenuators","Voltage","Crystalline materials","Optical propagation"]}],"doi":"10.1109/PROC.1963.1672","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5/31044/01443602.pdf","startPage":"147","endPage":"153","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31044","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PROC.1963.1672","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Gigacycle bandwidth coherent light traveling-wave phase modulator","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1443602","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Gigacycle bandwidth coherent light traveling-wave phase modulator","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1443602/","volume":"51","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 1963","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"28 June 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1963","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1963","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Gigacycle bandwidth coherent light traveling-wave phase modulator","sourcePdf":"01443602.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.064365S","chronDate":"Jan.  1963","isNumber":"31044","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"10","articleId":"1443602","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1963","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1443603,"authors":[{"name":"O.L.

This criterion is established for arbitrary information and noise spectral densities. The information is assumed phase- or frequency-encoded on the received signal. Explicit results are centered around the case of additive white Gaussian noise. The principal nonlinearity is assumed to be the phase detector which is represented as a product device. Threshold curves are derived for three types of signals: 1) Bandlimited phase-encoded white Gaussian signals, optimal receiver; 2) Bandlimited phase-encoded white Gaussian signals, second-order receiver; 3) Frequency-encoded white signals, optimal receiver. The phase-encoded white Gaussian signal threshold is then compared with Shannon's results. It was found that the optimal receiver threshold occurs 10 log\n<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">10</inf>\n(e) or 4.34 db above Shannon's limit. The second-order receiver was found to threshold 2 to 3 db above the optimal receiver in the region of normally encountered output signal-to-noise power ratios. Frequency-encoded white signals represent the character of residual noise in a communication link oscillator system. Residual frequency noise is induced by the ever present thermal noise in oscillator circuits. This particular thermal-induced noise cannot be removed entirely. For this fundamental noise process maximum receiver sensitivities are derived. An interesting result of quasi-linearization is that, for the signals considered, previous solutions of the Wiener-Hopf equation may be applied with only slight modifications.","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  1963","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1443691/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb.  1963","volume":"51","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 1963","dateOfInsertion":"28 June 2005","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A threshold criterion for phase-lock demodulation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A threshold criterion for phase-lock demodulation","sourcePdf":"01443691.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.028643S","chronDate":"Feb.  1963","isNumber":"31045","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"38","articleId":"1443691","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1963","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":1443726,"authors":[{"name":"W.R.

The smallest signal visible on a Type-A scan can be improved upon by the use of electromechanical integrators. Integration before detection is, in theory, ultimately the most effective, but runs into serious practical difficulties. These are avoided when the integration is performed after detection. Optimum predetector selectivity is formulated. The optimum detector (square law) is found, and other detectors compared.

This structure can be used to enhance as well as deplete the charge near the surface of the semiconductor. A simple model is proposed and the basic transistor current-voltage relationships are derived for the case of a thick oxide and shallow conducting channel. This case is in contrast to the p-n junction-type described by Shockley, the latter being analogous to a very thin oxide and a deep uniformly doped channel. A more detailed model is subsequently proposed in order to explain some experimentally observed anomalies for units not adequately described by the simpler model. In particular, the usual approximation of constant current in the saturation region is abandoned and consideration is given to the behavior of the drain resistance in this region. It is found that the relations predicting and describing this behavior are closely analogous to similar relations for vacuum tubes. Experimental data from units to which this model may be applied has shown close agreement with the theoretical predictions. Breakdown in the channel is also investigated and found to be a double-valued function of the gate voltage. For low-gate voltages the breakdown is induced directly by the drain-to-source field and occurs across the constricted portion of the channel near the drain. For higher-gate voltages carrier generation is induced directly by the gate-to-drain field with the source-to-drain sweep field acting to remove the impact ionized and/or field emitted carriers. Brief consideration is also given to the question of the validity of using Boltzmann or Fermi-Dirac statistics in devices which are not necessarily in thermal equilibrium. The use of these statistics to predict the formation of a gate-field-induced inversion layer at the oxide-silicon interface in typical depletion-type transistors is found to be unjustified. This is due to generation and flow rate limitations on the source of the carriers which form this layer, and contrasts with the case of the induced channel-type unit for which the use of these statistics appears justified. Experimental evidence regarding saturation and complete pinch-off of drain current has indicated that the inversion layer does, in fact, fail to exist, as predicted, for the depletion-type transistor. Units fabricated to date have the following typical characteristics: input impedance, 7 \u00b5\u00b5f, 10\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">+15</sup>\nohms; transconductance, 2000 \u00b5mhos; cutoff bias,-7 volts (depletion unit); rise time, 10 nsec. The yield of units has averaged over 95 per cent on recently fabricated wafers, indicating great promise for integrated electronics applications.","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1444418/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1963","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1963","publicationDate":"Sept. 1963","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"28 June 2005","volume":"51","issue":"9","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"The silicon insulated-gate field-effect transistor","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The silicon insulated-gate field-effect transistor","sourcePdf":"01444418.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.028743S","chronDate":"Sept.  1963","isNumber":"31052","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"160","articleId":"1444418","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1963","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1444431,"authors":[{"name":"C.E.

For both binary signaling and radar purposes, the \"on\" waveform should be a narrow pulse in order to maximize the \"signal-to-noise\" ratio.","doi":"10.1109/PROC.1963.2562","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5/31053/01444492.pdf","startPage":"1316","endPage":"1320","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PROC.1963.2562","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31053","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An optimum demodulator for poisson processes: Photon source detectors","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1444492/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct.  1963","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  1963","displayDocTitle":"An optimum demodulator for poisson processes: Photon source detectors","volume":"51","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 1963","dateOfInsertion":"28 June 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An optimum demodulator for poisson processes: Photon source detectors","sourcePdf":"01444492.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.029695S","chronDate":"Oct.  1963","isNumber":"31053","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"57","articleId":"1444492","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1963","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1444496,"authors":[{"name":"E.S.

A rigorous solution, including all of the infinite number of time-space harmonics, is obtained for the linearized model, which also is representative of a traveling-wave parametric circuit. In contrast with previous work relating to traveling-wave parametric circuits, however, no assumptions are imposed on the present model regarding mode coupling. The dispersion relation is represented graphically in a form which is a generalization of the familiar one-dimensional Brillouin diagram for stationary periodic structures. From the repeated cell pattern one ascertains that for this medium only two types of interaction are possible, 1) stable interactions, of the stop-band type, associated with frequency conversion effects and 2) potentially unstable interactions, characterized by a stop band in wavenumber rather than in frequency. These types of interaction occur, respectively, when the phase velocity of the pump modulation is less than or greater than that of a signal in the unmodulated medium. Separating these two types of interaction is a \"sonic\" region, which appears whenever these two phase velocities are approximately equal The characteristics of the stable interactions and the sonic region are discussed in the present paper; the unstable interactions are considered in Part II (to be published at a later date). The amplitudes of several of the time-space harmonics have also been calculated and are shown to satisfy the Manley-Rowe relations in the stop bands; of particular interest is the role of the minor harmonics and the error introduced by using only two harmonics, as in coupled-mode theory.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31053","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PROC.1963.2566","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5/31053/01444496.pdf","startPage":"1342","endPage":"1359","doi":"10.1109/PROC.1963.2566","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dispersion relations in time-space periodic media: Part I\u2014Stable interactions","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  1963","displayDocTitle":"Dispersion relations in time-space periodic media: Part I\u2014Stable interactions","volume":"51","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 1963","dateOfInsertion":"28 June 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1444496/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct.  1963","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dispersion relations in time-space periodic media: Part I\u2014Stable interactions","sourcePdf":"01444496.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.042196S","chronDate":"Oct.  1963","isNumber":"31053","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"44","articleId":"1444496","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1963","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1444521,"authors":[{"name":"L.B.

By feeding the reactance diodes with pump voltages which are mutually shifted in phase by \u00b190\u00b0 and by the additional insertion of a feedback admittance between input and output, complete decoupling is obtained in the backward direction. To obtain power matching on both sides, an idle circuit is arranged between the two converter stages which transmits voltages in both lower and upper sidebands. The practical design of an amplifier is described for a signal frequency of 200 Mc and a pump frequency of 940 Mc. The design of the idle circuit, the pump input and the adjustment of amount and phase angle of the pump voltages, as well as the neutralization, are explained in detail. Measuring results are given which were obtained with this test assembly that was designed in accordance with the rules given.

The role played by the phase angle between the capacitive and resistive modulation, first considered by Engelbrecht for the frequency converter and the special case of quadrature pumping, is also taken into account. On the basis of the gain criteria, a figure of merit of a parametric element applicable to the pumped condition is also extended to include the type of element considered. It is demonstrated that, all things being equal, the most favorable pumping phase is that for which the capacitive variation at the pump frequency lags the resistive variation by 90\u00b0 in phase. It is shown that of the nonlinear elements now being used for parametric applications, none satisfy the favorable phase condition. A convenient gain-frequency graph summarizing most of the theoretical conclusions is presented. Finally, it is also proved that for the case where the signal frequency is lower than the idler frequency, the highest frequency of operation obtainable with an existing series capacitive-resistive element can never be increased by the addition of a passive series nonlinear resistor, regardless of the pumping phase achievable by this addition.","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1444799/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1964","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1964","publicationDate":"March 1964","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"28 June 2005","volume":"52","issue":"3","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Pumping conditions for parametric gain with a nonlinear immittance element","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Pumping conditions for parametric gain with a nonlinear immittance element","sourcePdf":"01444799.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.042129S","chronDate":"March  1964","isNumber":"31058","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"3","articleId":"1444799","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1964","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1444857,"authors":[{"name":"C.E.

It is shown that the calculation of sidelobe levels in previously published data is not exact when low sidelobes are called for, since the effects of spectrum amplitude ripple in contributing to the range sidelobes have either been ignored or not stated. This paper presents more recent information on this subject, introducing a model of the Fresnel spectrum that permits a more accurate calculation of the compressed pulse sidelobe structure. Additional spectrum-associated paired-echo range sidelobes are predicted as a result of the model, and are observed in practice, having peak values up to 15 db larger than those derived on the basis of the idealized spectrum assumed in earlier studies. It is shown experimentally that elimination of the spectrum amplitude ripple results in removal of these paired-echo sidelobes, thus allowing more efficient use of the signal energy when low side-lobe levels are required. A predistorted linear FM pulse compression signal is presented as a realizable means for exerting control over the spectrum function. This new pulse compression technique does not require pulse envelope or rise-time shaping at the transmitter, and thus has application to high-power systems. Experimental waveforms illustrate the reduction of the spectrum-associated paired-echo sidelobes with the modified linear FM signal, and also show that the remaining range sidelobes do not appreciably increase as a function of Doppler shift.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Pulse compression methods","Predistortion","Radar signal processing","Matched filters","Transmitters","Equations","Gunn devices","Zinc","Cadmium","Solid state circuits"]}],"doi":"10.1109/PROC.1964.2927","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5/31059/01444857.pdf","startPage":"377","endPage":"389","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31059","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PROC.1964.2927","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A pulse compression predistortion function for efficient sidelobe reduction in a high-power radar","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1444857","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A pulse compression predistortion function for efficient sidelobe reduction in a high-power radar","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1444857/","volume":"52","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 1964","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"28 June 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  1964","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April  1964","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A pulse compression predistortion function for efficient sidelobe reduction in a high-power radar","sourcePdf":"01444857.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.032069S","chronDate":"April  1964","isNumber":"31059","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"40","articleId":"1444857","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1964","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1444858,"authors":[{"name":"H.E.

These circuits consist of a ladder network formed using series inductances and shunt capacitances; they give a Chebyshev impedance match between resistor terminations of arbitrary ratio (designs with resistor termination ratios from 1.5 to 50 are tabulated). The responses of these networks have moderately high attenuation at dc (the amount of attenuation depends on the termination ratio); their attenuation then falls to a very low level in the Chebyshev operating band, and then rises steeply above the operating band in a manner typical of low-pass filters. Designs having operating-band fractional bandwidths ranging from 0.2 to 1.0 are given. These impedance-transforming networks can be realized in lumped-element form for low-frequency applications, and in semilumped-element form (such as corrugated waveguide) at microwave frequencies.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5/31063/01445115.pdf","startPage":"939","endPage":"963","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","doi":"10.1109/PROC.1964.3185","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PROC.1964.3185","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31063","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1445115","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Tables of Chebyshev impedance\u2013transforming networks of low-pass filter form","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Chebyshev approximation","Impedance","Low pass filters","Attenuation","Resistors","Passband","Circuits","Capacitance","Microwave filters","Bandwidth"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1445115/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  1964","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug.  1964","displayDocTitle":"Tables of Chebyshev impedance\u2013transforming networks of low-pass filter form","volume":"52","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 1964","dateOfInsertion":"28 June 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Tables of Chebyshev impedance\u2013transforming networks of low-pass filter form","sourcePdf":"01445115.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.015777S","chronDate":"Aug.  1964","isNumber":"31063","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"93","articleId":"1445115","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1964","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1445130,"authors":[{"name":"R.T.

It is intended to reveal cost trends rather than give accurate results for specific cases and deals only with fabrication costs. A yield-area relationship is used which takes into account chip-to-chip variations in defect density. It is found that the ratio (circuit cost per component/cost of discrete transistor) is a minimum at a chip size which is determined primarily by the spot defect density on the device. This optimum chip size lies between approximately 20 and approximately 60 mils square for a wide range of parameter values. State-of-the-art parameter values indicate a potential order of magnitude cost saving in integrated circuits compared with discrete transistors. The minimum value for the cost ratio is in general inversely proportional to the maximum packing density of components on a semiconductor slice and has a limiting value approximately 1/8N, N\n<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">0</inf>\nbeing the number of components which can be packed on the chip size normally used for transistors. Arrays of identical logic gates fit the circuit model used quite closely, and the curves indicate that the cost per gate in reasonably densely packed arrays can be less than the cost of a discrete transistor. The results also indicate that when systems requirements make it desirable to include larger numbers of components in one package than the optimum for one monolith, wired-chip schemes are preferable to single monoliths, the optimum chip size being smaller than that for a simple monolith.","doi":"10.1109/PROC.1964.3442","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PROC.1964.3442","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5/31067/01445372.pdf","startPage":"1537","endPage":"1545","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31067","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cost-size optima of monolithic integrated circuits","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1445372/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1964","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1964","displayDocTitle":"Cost-size optima of monolithic integrated circuits","volume":"52","issue":"12","dateOfInsertion":"28 June 2005","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 1964","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cost-size optima of monolithic integrated circuits","sourcePdf":"01445372.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033465S","chronDate":"Dec.  1964","isNumber":"31067","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"289","articleId":"1445372","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1964","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1445383,"authors":[{"name":"W.E.

Improved bandwidth is generally expected from integrated-electronic fabrication and will ease tolerances on element parameters.","doi":"10.1109/PROC.1964.3456","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5/31067/01445386.pdf","startPage":"1617","endPage":"1623","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PROC.1964.3456","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31067","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Microwave applications of integrated-circuit techniques","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1445386/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1964","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1964","displayDocTitle":"Microwave applications of integrated-circuit techniques","volume":"52","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 1964","dateOfInsertion":"28 June 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Microwave applications of integrated-circuit techniques","sourcePdf":"01445386.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.016909S","chronDate":"Dec.  1964","isNumber":"31067","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"5","articleId":"1445386","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1964","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1445389,"authors":[{"name":"B.

It is the subsequent processes which largely determine the cost and reliability of the device. Systems using chips in individual encapsulations, interconnected by conventional means, do not necessarily make full use of the advantages of integrated circuits. By using subsystems containing several chips the cost can be reduced at the same time as giving greater circuit design flexibility. Some new methods of interconnecting the electrodes on separate semiconductor substrates are described. It is shown how these methods can also be used for hybrid systems, e.g., where semiconductor circuits are used on thin film circuits without separate encapsulation.","doi":"10.1109/PROC.1964.3463","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5/31067/01445393.pdf","startPage":"1655","endPage":"1657","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PROC.1964.3463","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31067","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"New interconnection techniques for multichip and hybrid integrated circuits","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1964","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1445393/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1964","displayDocTitle":"New interconnection techniques for multichip and hybrid integrated circuits","dateOfInsertion":"28 June 2005","volume":"52","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 1964","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"New interconnection techniques for multichip and hybrid integrated circuits","sourcePdf":"01445393.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.068927S","chronDate":"Dec.  1964","isNumber":"31067","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"1","articleId":"1445393","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1964","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":1445395,"authors":[{"name":"J.J.

However, gains made at the device and circuit level can sometimes be offset at the system level, particularly if the normal range of components is not available. This paper considers some of the system tradeoffs involved in standardization vs optimization of circuits and illustrates some of the penalties paid when capacitors, inductors and transformers are not available in integrated structures.

The receiver, which is maximum likelihood, is algebraic in nature, relatively easy to instrument, and does not require local generation of the possible sent messages. The probability of incorrect decoding is the same for each sent message.

Each amplifier stage consists of a pair of electrically similar transistors whose input and output signals are combined by 3-dB directional couplers. This eliminates the need for tuning adjustments. For a wide frequency range, the main advantages of the balanced design over more conventional multistage amplifiers are 1) improved input and output impedance matching, gain flatness, phase linearity, gain compression, and intermodulation characteristics, 2) possible designing of the amplifier simultaneously for minimum noise figure and good input match, 3) relatively little effect on overall amplifier gain and matching by changes in the distribution of transistor impedance characteristics, provided that transistors can be selected in similar pairs. The amplifier gain is easily controlled over a wide range by the dc bias with little degradation of the gain flatness and impedance matches. To obtain these advantages, a second transistor is required for each amplifier stage. A four-stage balanced amplifier was designed and constructed in printed circuit form for L-band operation, using Western Electric GF-40037 transistors in the common emitter configuration. The transistors were paired in a test circuit so that their input or output impedances were within about ten per cent. (With the current GF-40037 distribution, this takes less than five random tries on the average.) Without any tuning adjustments, the following characteristics were obtained over a 20 per cent (and 60 per cent) frequency band in the 0.8 to 1.6-Gc/s range: Gain = 20 dB \u00b1 0.2 dB (\u00b10.5 dB) Reverse Loss >50 dB (>40 dB) Phase < \u00b11\u00b0 from linear (\u00b16\u00b0) VSWR In < 1.10 (<1.2) VSWR Out < 1.10 (<1.2) Noise Figure\u22456 dB Gain Compression \u2264 0.25 dB at 0-dBm output signal level Third-Order Intermodulation- With -3-dBm output power from two signals at frequencies f\n<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">A</inf>\nand f\n<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">B</inf>\n, power out at 2f\n<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">A</inf>\n- f\n<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">B</inf>\nand 2f\n<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">B</inf>\n- f\n<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">A</inf>\n\u2243 -50 dBm.

The interference is composed of both noise and intersymbol interference. The optimum receiver, using the same criterion, is also obtained for the case in which the intersymbol interference is constrained to be zero. The average error probabilities associated with these receivers are compared with each other and with a matched filter receiver in one example. In addition, formulas for optimum transmitted pulse shapes are derived, and the joint optimization of transmitter and receiver is carried out in detail for the case of signaling through a noisy RC filter. Other formulas enable one to explore the dependence of the minimum mean square interference on the data rate, the noise spectrum, the impulse response of the transmission medium, and the autocorrelation of the message sequence.","doi":"10.1109/PROC.1965.3682","startPage":"248","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5/31070/01445612.pdf","endPage":"259","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31070","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PROC.1965.3682","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1965","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1965","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1445612/","displayDocTitle":"Nyquist's problem\u2014The joint optimization of transmitter and receiver in pulse amplitude modulation","volume":"53","issue":"3","dateOfInsertion":"28 June 2005","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 1965","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Nyquist's problem\u2014The joint optimization of transmitter and receiver in pulse amplitude modulation","sourcePdf":"01445612.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.040897S","chronDate":"March  1965","isNumber":"31070","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"57","articleId":"1445612","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1965","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1445613,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The wide-bandwidth low drive power performance is obtained by using the traveling-wave approach previously used in the gigacycle bandwidth phase modulator. The electro-optic material is KDP cut in the same orientation used in the phase modulator and combined with other optical elements to produce retardation-amplitude modulation. Temperature variations through the KDP produce a deflection and decollimation of the output beam. Experiments have been conducted to determine the magnitude of these effects. Corrective measures have been devised. Comparatively good agreement between the computed and the measured bandwidth has been obtained.","doi":"10.1109/PROC.1965.3815","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5/31072/01445745.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PROC.1965.3815","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31072","startPage":"455","endPage":"460","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Gigacycle-bandwidth coherent-light traveling-wave amplitude modulator","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1445745","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Gigacycle-bandwidth coherent-light traveling-wave amplitude modulator","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1965","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1445745/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1965","isJournal":true,"volume":"53","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 1965","dateOfInsertion":"28 June 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Gigacycle-bandwidth coherent-light traveling-wave amplitude modulator","sourcePdf":"01445745.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.042746S","chronDate":"May  1965","isNumber":"31072","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"38","articleId":"1445745","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1965","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":1445747,"authors":[{"name":"R.H.

These methods generate a system of linear equations for the unknown current density by enforcing the boundary conditions at discrete points in the scattering body or on its surface. This approach shows promise of leading to a systematic solution for a dielectric or conducting body of arbitrary size and shape. The relative merits of the linear-equation solution and the variational solutions are discussed and numerical results, obtained by these two methods, are presented for straight wires of finite length. The computation effort required with the linear-equation solution can be reduced by expanding the current distribution in a series of modes of the proper type, by making a change of variables for integration, and by employing interpolation formulas. Solutions are readily obtained for a scattering body placed in an incident plane-wave field or in the near-zone of a source. Examples are included for both cases, using a straight wire of finite length as the scattering body. The application of these techniques to scattering by a dielectric body is illustrated with dielectric rods of finite length.","doi":"10.1109/PROC.1965.4057","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5/31075/01445987.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PROC.1965.4057","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31075","startPage":"796","endPage":"804","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Digital computer solutions of the rigorous equations for scattering problems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1445987","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Digital computer solutions of the rigorous equations for scattering problems","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  1965","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1445987/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug.  1965","isJournal":true,"volume":"53","issue":"8","publicationDate":"Aug. 1965","dateOfInsertion":"28 June 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Digital computer solutions of the rigorous equations for scattering problems","sourcePdf":"01445987.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.029282S","chronDate":"Aug.  1965","isNumber":"31075","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"103","articleId":"1445987","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1965","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1445988,"authors":[{"name":"P.C.

The scattered wave is first represented by a distribution of electric dipoles over the surface in question, with the response from any dipole proportional to the induced surface current density at that point. The surface current is then determined by the \"boundary condition\" that the scattered wave, through interference, precisely cancels the incident wave inside the obstacle. One obtains in this mariner a pair of coupled (infinite) matrix equations for the surface current. Green's identity permits decoupling of the equations, reducing the problem to roughly the equivalent of two independent scalar problems. The equations have been specialized to axially symmetric obstacles and then solved numerically on the IBM 7094 for several examples of interest.

The discussion is limited to perfectly conducting bodies: in particular, ellipsoids, finite cones, ogives, cylinders, thin wires, wire loops, and flat plates. An attempt is made to cover the complete spectrum of body dimension to wavelength ratios; that is, the Rayleigh region, the resonance region, and the optics region are all considered from the points of view of both monostatic and bistatic phenomena.

In the oscillator model developed by Adler [1], the mechanism of the locking process depends upon the following. 1) The initial frequency difference between the oscillator and external signals. 2) The relative amplitude between the injected and the oscillator signals. 3) The circuit parameters. There are cases when the time required for locking must be known, particularly when an oscillator is being locked to a pulsed signal. In this paper, the work of Adler is extended to develop an equation which is useful for higher levels of locking signal, a case often encountered when an oscillator is being injection locked by a pulsed signal. Because the solution of this equation is unwieldy and difficult to understand intuitively, except in very special cases, curves describing the locking mechanism were obtained using a digital computer. These curves enable a designer to construct oscillators which will provide a desired performance. The curves were checked experimentally and showed a close agreement between predicted and measured results. The experimental data indicates that the theory describes the locking time remarkably well even at high levels of locking signal.","doi":"10.1109/PROC.1965.4345","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31078","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PROC.1965.4345","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5/31078/01446275.pdf","startPage":"1723","endPage":"1727","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Injection locking of oscillators","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1965","displayDocTitle":"Injection locking of oscillators","volume":"53","issue":"11","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1965","dateOfInsertion":"28 June 2005","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 1965","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1446275/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Injection locking of oscillators","sourcePdf":"01446275.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.026991S","chronDate":"Nov.  1965","isNumber":"31078","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"150","articleId":"1446275","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1965","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":1446312,"authors":[{"name":"J.S.

This has proved to be of great interest in seismological research and is particularly useful in the monitoring of underground nuclear tests, since the events are of small magnitude and the criteria used to distinguish source type depend on freeing the weak signal as far as possible from additive microseismic noise, reverberation components, and interfering earthquake activity that might chance to occur simultaneously. Results achieved by the use of seismic arrays of several kilometers aperture and several tens of sensors were sufficiently promising to suggest that substantial further improvements might be expected from an even larger array having more than an order of magnitude greater aperture and number of sensors. Such a Large Aperture Seismic Array (LASA) has been built and is being evaluated. The number of sensors is 525 and the aperture is 200 km. The notions underlying the LASA development are presented briefly in this paper, which serves as an introduction to three more detailed papers in this issue. After a brief historical resume, the principles of array signal processing are reviewed, and a prognosis of LASA capabilities is presented. The paper concludes with a discussion of the extent to which the results obtained to date have confirmed our expectations.","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1965","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1965","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1446383/","volume":"53","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 1965","dateOfInsertion":"28 June 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Principles of an experimental large aperture seismic array (LASA)","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Principles of an experimental large aperture seismic array (LASA)","sourcePdf":"01446383.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033214S","chronDate":"Dec.  1965","isNumber":"31079","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"7","articleId":"1446383","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1965","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1446447,"authors":[{"name":"R.

Two cases are considered: (A), the clipping of an unmodulated noise band (DINA) [1] and (B) a carrier modulated by clipped noise. The computations are made for various shapes of noise bands before clipping, viz., 1) a uniform or rectangular structure, 2) a Gaussian distribution, 3) an \"optical\" (Lorentzian) shape factor of the type 1/[(v-v\n<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">0</inf>\n)\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n+ \u03b4\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n]. The simplest type of calculation to make is that for what we term \"extreme clipping,\" wherein the limiting amplitude is very small compared to the rms amplitude before clipping. The mathematical theory for this is given in Section III, while Section IV develops the theory for clipping at an arbitrary level. The basic mathematical method, which is rather general and is useful, we believe, for a variety of noise problems, is presented in Section II and consists in utilizing a relation between the correlation function and the normal surface, along lines suggested by Rice [1]. The results of the calculation are discussed in Section I and are displayed in Figures 4-10 and Tables I and II. If the clipping is not down to more than the rms level before limiting (equivalent to clipping at about 1.4 times the rms level after clipping), there is practically no distortion of the spectrum. Even in the case of extreme clipping the wastage of power due to spoiling of the spectrum's uniformity is small, amounting to only 31 percent in (A) and 24 percent in (B). Of the 31 percent loss in (A), 19 percent is due to production of harmonics of the central frequency. Corresponding harmonics are absent in (B). Clipping is beneficial for jamming purposes in either (A) or (B) since it reduces the peak power requirements. In addition, in (B) it materially diminishes the wastage of power in the carrier frequency. These facts are demonstrated particularly clearly by Tables I and II. For instance, Table II shows us that in (B) the ratio of the energy in the noise sideband to that in the carrier is only 0.23 when the clipping level is twice the original rms noise level, but increases to 0.52 when these two levels are the same, and to 1.0 for extreme clipping. It is to be cautioned that the present report calculates only the (intensity) spectrum of the clipped noise, and does not deal with its effectiveness on a receiver, which we hope to discuss later from a quantitative standpoint [2]. We can, however, say qualitatively that if the receiver breadth is very small compared to the noise band, the received disturbance will have the same type of Gaussian fluctuation, and hence the same effectiveness as unclipped noise with the same spectral distribution. On the other hand, if the receiver is comparable with the noise band in width, there will be, due to the clipping, a tendency for a \"ceiling\" in the resultant deflection of the recording device, and under these conditions the utility of clipped noise for jamming is materially diminished.","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1966","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1966","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1446497/","volume":"54","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 1966","dateOfInsertion":"28 June 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"The spectrum of clipped noise","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The spectrum of clipped noise","sourcePdf":"01446497.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044482S","chronDate":"Jan.  1966","isNumber":"31080","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"168","articleId":"1446497","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1966","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1446501,"authors":[{"name":"W.R.

However, frequency translation is only an approximation to the actual Doppler effect which is a time-expansion or time-compression of the waveform resulting from the continuous expansion or compression of the transit path. This paper investigates the effects of Doppler dispersion in matched filters which use frequency translation for Doppler compensation. It is found that the effects of Doppler dispersion are independent of the carrier frequency and negligible if the dispersion product, i.e., the absolute magnitude of the product of the signal bandwidth, duration, and delay rate, is less than unity. If the dispersion product is greater than unity the dispersion effects are serious. In the latter case the time and frequency resolution of the system are degraded and the output pulse is reduced in amplitude. The maximum improvement that can be obtained in the signal-to-noise power ratio is equal to the reciprocal of the delay rate magnitude. This maximum signal-to-noise gain is achieved when the time-bandwidth product of the receiver is chosen such that the dispersion product is approximately unity.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Dispersion","Matched filters","Frequency","Bandwidth","Signal resolution","Doppler effect","Transmitters","Filter bank","Doppler radar","Delay effects"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31080","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PROC.1966.4571","startPage":"33","endPage":"39","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5/31080/01446501.pdf","doi":"10.1109/PROC.1966.4571","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Doppler dispersion effects in matched filter detection and resolution","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1966","displayDocTitle":"Doppler dispersion effects in matched filter detection and resolution","publicationDate":"Jan. 1966","volume":"54","issue":"1","dateOfInsertion":"28 June 2005","isJournal":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1446501/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1966","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Doppler dispersion effects in matched filter detection and resolution","sourcePdf":"01446501.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.056463S","chronDate":"Jan.  1966","isNumber":"31080","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"17","articleId":"1446501","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1966","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1446541,"authors":[{"name":"L.M.

This formula describes qualitatively and quantitatively the manner in which thermal and shot noise act to corrupt the performance of an ideal oscillator. The statistical properties of the signal are then evaluated, as it emerges from the oscillator stage, after passage through an output filter and after being operated on by an ideal n-times multiplier. Expressions are derived for the short term frequency stability, the power spectral density, and the power spectrum of the signal, as well as for the spectral density of the signal phase. The key to the results reported is an apparently novel perturbation technique which does not require smoothing of the instantaneous nonlinearity in the basic differential equation. Discussion of the solutions shows that the instantneous nonlinearities cause the device to act simultaneously like a linear AGC oscillator and like a high Q passive tuned circuit, with each aspect accorded one half the total noise excitation. Possible implications of this effect for other types of transient conditions in oscillators are indicated briefly.","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1446561/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  1966","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb.  1966","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"54","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 1966","dateOfInsertion":"28 June 2005","displayDocTitle":"The effects of noise in oscillators","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The effects of noise in oscillators","sourcePdf":"01446561.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039121S","chronDate":"Feb.  1966","isNumber":"31081","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"53","articleId":"1446561","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1966","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1446562,"authors":[{"name":"R.

Classical modulation theory has been immensely useful, but it is a restrictive theory because it can deal tractably with only a limited class of possible modulation processes. In this paper we seek to take the first few steps toward a broader and more unified theory of modulation--a theory which will encompass several recently proposed hybrid modulation schemes as well as conventional techniques, which will suggest new modulation processes, and which might lead toward unification of modulation theory and coding theory. The paper is divided into two parts. Part I is devoted to theoretical development as summarized below. The results of Part I are applied in Part II to study modulation processes per se. The paper as a whole is in the nature of a wide ranging survey rather than a rigorously detailed analysis. The most general form of modulated wave exhibits simultaneous phase and envelope fluctuations. In the first half of Part I, equations are developed to describe phase-envelope relationships when the wave is band-limited. These equations prove to be intimately dependent on the real and complex zeros of the wave. Real zeros (\"zero crossings\") are familiar physical attributes. Complex zeros, however, are physically rather covert and are a concept foreign to many engineers. Both kinds of zeros are easy to interpret mathematically in terms of the factorization of a Fourier series. In the second half of Part I, three simple examples are used to illustrate relationships between zeros, spectra, envelopes, and phase functions. These examples lead to operational procedures for representing signals in terms of zeros and, most importantly, to a viewpoint wherein zeros are regarded as fundamental informational attributes of signals. This viewpoint leads, in Part II, to the concept of modulation as zero manipulation.","doi":"10.1109/PROC.1966.4695","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5/31082/01446625.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31082","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PROC.1966.4695","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","startPage":"340","endPage":"353","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Toward a unified theory of modulation part I: Phase-envelope relationships","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1446625","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1966","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1966","displayDocTitle":"Toward a unified theory of modulation part I: Phase-envelope relationships","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1446625/","volume":"54","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 1966","dateOfInsertion":"28 June 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Toward a unified theory of modulation part I: Phase-envelope relationships","sourcePdf":"01446625.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.052033S","chronDate":"March  1966","isNumber":"31082","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"130","articleId":"1446625","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1966","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1446629,"authors":[{"name":"W.T.

The propagation path is 450 meters above sea level at the transmitter and traverses an 18.95-km path to the receiver, which is at an elevation of 39 meters atop a two-story building in El Segundo, Calif. The elevation angle is 1.17 degrees when corrected for curvature and refraction. Received picture quality and tropospheric scintillation and attenuation for various weather conditions are discussed. Tropospheric attenuation ranged from about 13 dB on a typical day to approximately 36 dB when moderate rainfall (\u223c4 mm/hr) occurred over much of the 18.95-km path. Tropospheric turbulence effects were almost nonexistent on days of heavy fog but reached peak-to-peak magnitudes of 20 dB or more in received signal fluctuations on dry, windy days. High quality television and voice reception were obtained over this link even during light to moderate rainfall periods (\u223c3 mm/hr). A transmitter output of approximately 100 mW, 0.61-m parabolas at each end of the link, and a receiver noise figure of 25 dB were the main system characteristics. Tropospheric attenuation measurements are in close agreement with values calculated from modified versions of the Van Vleck expressions for attenuation due to oxygen and water vapor. The average of measured tropospheric attenuation rates was approximately 0.7 dB/km for July 1965.","doi":"10.1109/PROC.1966.4756","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5/31083/01446686.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PROC.1966.4756","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31083","startPage":"449","endPage":"454","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Propagation observations at 3.2 millimeters","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1446686","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Propagation observations at 3.2 millimeters","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  1966","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1446686/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April  1966","isJournal":true,"volume":"54","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 1966","dateOfInsertion":"28 June 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Propagation observations at 3.2 millimeters","sourcePdf":"01446686.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.02792S","chronDate":"April  1966","isNumber":"31083","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"6","articleId":"1446686","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1966","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":1446714,"authors":[{"name":"J.

Because of a number of errors, the computed or physically realized signal is only approximately equal to f(t). The most common sampling errors are: round-off of f(nT), truncation of the series generating f(t), aliasing of frequency components above half the sampling rate 1/T, jitter in the recording times nT, loss of a number of sampled values, and imperfect filtering in the recovery of f(t).

When there is a constraint, the solution is reduced to that of a polynomial; when there is no constraint, the solution is given in a very simple form. First, it is shown that for a given array geometry there exists a finite permissible range of the Q-factor and this range reduces to zero for large spacings. Second, a detailed comparison between four well-known excitations (uniform, Hansen-Woodyard, optimum cophasal, and optimum) is made and the main results are as follows, 1) The Hansen-Woodyard excitation yields a directivity higher than that of the uniform only when the element spacing is somewhat smaller than a half wavelength (\u03bb/2), but at the price of much higher Q. On the other hand, it is much lower than that of the optimum excitation. 2) For spacing less than \u03bb/2, the optimum excitation is strongly tapered toward the ends of the array and approximately antiphasa (i.e., 0, 180\u00b0 0, 180\u00b0, ...); whereas for spacing greater than or equal to \u03bb/2, it is nearly uniform and cophasal. 3) For large spacings, the directivity of uniform excitation is nearly optimum. For small spacings, the optimum directivity becomes much higher than all others, but is always associated with an enormously large Q-factor. Therefore in this case a constraint of the Q-factor is important. 4) Hansen-Woodyard and uniform arrays have the interesting property that their sensitivity factors are independent of spacing. The optimization of signal-to-noise ratio is also demonstrated. In particular, the result shows that although an improvement in gain over the uniform excitation is very difficult to realize in practice, a substantial improvement in signal-to-noise ratio is entirely practical. Other numerical results and some extensions of the theory to aperture antennas are also included.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5/31087/01446918.pdf","startPage":"1033","endPage":"1045","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","doi":"10.1109/PROC.1966.4988","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PROC.1966.4988","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31087","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1446918","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimization of directivity and signal-to-noise ratio of an arbitrary antenna array","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Signal to noise ratio","Antenna arrays","Q factor","Working environment noise","Laboratories","Directive antennas","Military computing","Constraint optimization","Polynomials","Geometry"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1446918/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  1966","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug.  1966","displayDocTitle":"Optimization of directivity and signal-to-noise ratio of an arbitrary antenna array","volume":"54","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 1966","dateOfInsertion":"28 June 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimization of directivity and signal-to-noise ratio of an arbitrary antenna array","sourcePdf":"01446918.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.050043S","chronDate":"Aug.  1966","isNumber":"31087","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"135","articleId":"1446918","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1966","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1446919,"authors":[{"name":"H.

The reasons for design automation are a possible reduction in costs, increased problem analysis capabilities, an increase in man's creative ability through man-machine interaction, increased speed of design, change control and documentation, and an increase in the efficiency of available manpower. The design problems and their solutions discussed can be divided into the following three areas. 1) Preconstruction Analysis: The system characteristics can be evaluated prior to construction by using a general purpose system simulator, such as the SIMSCRIPT computer of Markowitz, the GPSS routine of Gordon, or the SOL system of Knuth. 2) Design and Implementation: Routines have been developed for doing circuit design and logic generation and simplification. Logic can be automatically checked by using logic simulators. Finally, the physical implementation processes have been almost completely automated. Some of the problems in this area the assignment of logic to cards, the assignment of cards to backboards, the placement of cards on backboards, and the routing of conductors on backboards and cards. 3) Software: Today, the importance of design automation techniques in the development of software has become apparent. One important development in this area is in the automatic generation of test routines for the detection and diagnosis of component failures.","doi":"10.1109/PROC.1966.5252","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5/31091/01447182.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PROC.1966.5252","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31091","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","startPage":"1708","endPage":"1721","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1966","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"General survey of design automation of digital computers","volume":"54","issue":"12","dateOfInsertion":"28 June 2005","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 1966","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1447182/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1966","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"General survey of design automation of digital computers","sourcePdf":"01447182.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.143486S","chronDate":"Dec.  1966","isNumber":"31091","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"13","articleId":"1447182","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1966","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1447203,"authors":[{"name":"M.J.

This approach is based on special properties inherent in a suitably chosen redundant residue number system (RRNS). In this paper, RRNS algorithms are described which can detect any number of residues in error, and can detect and correct one residue in error, in a data word suitable for scientific or control computation. Moreover, it is shown that there are RRNS algorithms available to perform all arithmetic operations needed in ordinary general-purpose computation. To this end, a new class of residue arithmetic techniques based on the properties of \"macro-coefficients\" is introduced, which permits all required fractional operations to be carried out and leads to a convenient form of the error-detection-and-correction procedures. The implications of these developments for ultra-reliable computer design are discussed, and the RRNS approach to computer ultrareliability is compared with several others which have been suggested; binary information with a residue check digit (BRCD), linear codes, and logic-circuit-level redundancy techniques such as majority voting.","doi":"10.1109/PROC.1966.5275","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5/31091/01447205.pdf","startPage":"1920","endPage":"1931","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PROC.1966.5275","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31091","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Self-checked computation using residue arithmetic","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1447205/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1966","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1966","displayDocTitle":"Self-checked computation using residue arithmetic","volume":"54","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 1966","dateOfInsertion":"28 June 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Self-checked computation using residue arithmetic","sourcePdf":"01447205.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.062185S","chronDate":"Dec.  1966","isNumber":"31091","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"71","articleId":"1447205","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1966","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":1447228,"authors":[{"name":"P.C.

Increasing speed and decreasing size and cost of digital components make it likely that digital filtering, already used extensively in the computer simulation of analog filters, will perform, in real-time devices, the functions which are now performed almost exclusively by analog components. In this paper, using the z-transform calculus, several digital filter design techniques are reviewed, and new ones are presented. One technique can be used to design a digital filter whose impulse response is like that of a given analog filter; other techniques are suitable for the design of a digital filter meeting frequency response criteria. Another technique yields digital filters with linear phase, specified frequency response, and controlled impulse response duration. The effect of digital arithmetic on the behavior of digital filters is also considered.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5/31093/01447364.pdf","startPage":"149","endPage":"171","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","doi":"10.1109/PROC.1967.5434","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PROC.1967.5434","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31093","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1447364","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Digital filter design techniques in the frequency domain","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Digital filters","Frequency domain analysis","Difference equations","Mathematics","Hardware","Filtering theory","Sampling methods","Quantization","Gold","Nonlinear filters"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1447364/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  1967","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb.  1967","displayDocTitle":"Digital filter design techniques in the frequency domain","volume":"55","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 1967","dateOfInsertion":"28 June 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Digital filter design techniques in the frequency domain","sourcePdf":"01447364.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036356S","chronDate":"Feb.  1967","isNumber":"31093","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"155","articleId":"1447364","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1967","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1447366,"authors":[{"name":"J.

The LASA is roughly equivalent to 21 separate subarrays, each consisting of 25 sensors, spread over an aperture of 200 km. The present work considers the problem of designing a linear filter which combines the outputs of the 25 sensors in a subarray so as to suppress the noise without distorting the signal, or event. This filter provides a minimum-variance unbiased estimate of the signal which is the same as the maximum-likelihood estimate of the signal if the noise is a multidimensional Gaussian process. An extensive discussion of the theory of multidimensional maximum-likelihood processing is given. A computer program implementation of the maximum-likelihood filter is presented which employs the cross-correlation matrix of noise measured just prior to the arrival of the event. This time-domain synthesis procedure requires relatively large amounts of computer time to synthesize the filter, and is quite sensitive to the assumption of noise stationarity. The asymptotic theory of maximum-likelihood filtering is also given. An asymptotically optimum frequency-domain synthesis technique is given for two-sided multidimensional filters. This procedure is well suited to machine computation and has the advantage with respect to the time-domain procedure of requiring about 10 times less computation time. A description of a computer program implementation of the frequency-domain synthesis method is given which employs the spectral matrix of the noise estimated just before the arrival of the event. The experimental results obtained by processing several events recorded at the LASA are presented, as well as a comparison of the performance of the frequency-domain method relative to the time-domain synthesis technique. It is found that the signal-to-noise improvement given by the frequency-domain procedure is within 2 dB of the gain obtained with the time-domain procedure, and that the frequency-domain method is relatively insensitive to the assumption of noise stationarity.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5/31093/01447369.pdf","startPage":"192","endPage":"211","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","doi":"10.1109/PROC.1967.5439","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PROC.1967.5439","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31093","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1447369","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multidimensional maximum-likelihood processing of a large aperture seismic array","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multidimensional systems","Apertures","Nonlinear filters","Maximum likelihood estimation","Time domain analysis","Signal processing","Signal synthesis","Monitoring","Nuclear weapons","Testing"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1447369/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  1967","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb.  1967","displayDocTitle":"Multidimensional maximum-likelihood processing of a large aperture seismic array","volume":"55","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 1967","dateOfInsertion":"28 June 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multidimensional maximum-likelihood processing of a large aperture seismic array","sourcePdf":"01447369.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.040882S","chronDate":"Feb.  1967","isNumber":"31093","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"170","articleId":"1447369","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1967","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1447388,"authors":[{"name":"A.B.

The amount of quantizing noise which contaminates the decoded analog signal is inextricably tied to the amount of redundancy present in the signal and in the digital bit stream. Reducing the quantizing noise and, therefore, increasing the fidelity of the resulting signal requires that the redundancy in the digital bit stream be reduced or eliminated. There is a point, however, beyond which the quantizing noise cannot be further reduced. This is discussed in quantitative terms by deriving an upper bound on the signal-to-quantizing noise power ratio possible for a given bit rate and signal ensemble. Ratios of signal-to-quantizing noise greater than this bound are not possible for digital encoding systems. This bound is compared with the operation of pulse code modulation, differential pulse code modulation, and delta modulation systems.","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1447413/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1967","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1967","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","publicationDate":"March 1967","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"28 June 2005","volume":"55","issue":"3","displayDocTitle":"A bound on signal-to-quantizing noise ratios for digital encoding systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A bound on signal-to-quantizing noise ratios for digital encoding systems","sourcePdf":"01447413.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.031073S","chronDate":"March  1967","isNumber":"31094","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"27","articleId":"1447413","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1967","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1447416,"authors":[{"name":"J.E.

The system parameters my be adjusted so that an optimum run-length encoding may be found; the great advantages of run-length quantizing are shown, especially with regard to practical instrumentation, leading to the use of buffer stores of modest capacity. One particular cheap form of receiver operates on a quantized-variable-velocity principle and, being much more simple and cheap than the transmitter, is suitable for use in situations requiring many receivers.","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1447423/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1967","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1967","publicationDate":"March 1967","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"28 June 2005","volume":"55","issue":"3","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Results of a prototype television bandwidth compression scheme","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Results of a prototype television bandwidth compression scheme","sourcePdf":"01447423.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.067532S","chronDate":"March  1967","isNumber":"31094","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"54","articleId":"1447423","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1967","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1447424,"authors":[{"name":"J.O.

The process depends on the properties of the source and the receiver which in this case is the human sense of vision. Emphasis is given to the examination of the properties of the receiver and the selection of an appropriate criterion of performance. The criterion adopted is the probabilistic measure of viewer preference in a direct comparative judgment between the original and the coded-decoded version. For this criterion the precision with which picture components need be reproduced will depend primarily on the visual thresholds associated with the picture components. The \"Optimum Decision\" model of threshold vision is investigated using the criterion. As an example a practical encoder is discussed which is designed around the loss of sensitivity of the visual system adjacent to a change in luminance. High-quality pictures have been encoded having first-order entropies in the range 0.8 to 2.0 bits per picture element.","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1447424/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1967","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1967","volume":"55","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"28 June 2005","publicationDate":"March 1967","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Source-receiver encoding of television signals","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Source-receiver encoding of television signals","sourcePdf":"01447424.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.07167S","chronDate":"March  1967","isNumber":"31094","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"21","articleId":"1447424","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1967","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":1447438,"authors":[{"name":"D.C.

When the signal is absent, the decision statistic has a central chi-square distribution with the number of degrees of freedom equal to twice the time-bandwidth product of the input. When the signal is present, the decision statistic has a noncentral chi-square distribution with the same number of degrees of freedom and a noncentrality parameter \u03bb equal to the ratio of signal energy to two-sided noise spectral density. Since the noncentral chi-square distribution has not been tabulated extensively enough for our purpose, an approximate form was used. This form replaces the noncentral chi-square with a modified chi-square whose degrees of freedom and threshold are determined by the noncentrality parameter and the previous degrees of freedom. Sets of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves are drawn for several time-bandwidth products, as well as an extended nomogram of the chi-square cumulative probability which can be used for rapid calculation of false alarm and detection probabilities.

Such sonars are shown to have velocity (i.e., Doppler) and acceleration tolerances far different from that predicted by narrowband radar theory. Unlike the narrowband case, the wideband velocity tolerance may be quite small and is approximately independent of the carrier frequency and inversely proportional to the time-bandwidth product (TW). Narrowband radar-type calculations of velocity tolerance can give erroneous results far in excess of the true value. This is because the narrowband velocity tolerance is derived entirely on the basis of temporal overlap loss, whereas the actual tolerance depends primarily on the slope difference between the frequency-time sweeps of the received and reference signals. High acceleration tolerance, without separate acceleration processing channels, can be achieved by cross-correlating the acceleration return with a \"best match\" velocity reference function. The resultant wideband acceleration tolerance is approximately inversely proportional to WT\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\nand better than the narrowband tolerance by a factor of 12 Q (Q = carrier frequency/bandwidth).

Noise figure measurements in material whose experimental gain behaves according to small signal theory have allowed evaluation of the level of acoustic flux at the amplifier output plane when noise saturation occurs. Extrapolation from measured points yields a relationship between the acoustic flux saturation level and the material carrier concentration. Measurements also indicate that, even for noise flux levels approaching saturation, signal saturation occurs for bunching parameters slightly greater than 1. Second harmonic distortion is more than 20 decibels down in this condition. The interrelationships between signal power levels and noise flux levels are examined for their effect on an amplifier's maximum possible gain and dynamic range. In particular, maximum possible ultrasonic gain is found to be limited to approximately 80 decibels.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31098","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PROC.1967.5772","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5/31098/01447702.pdf","startPage":"1128","endPage":"1135","doi":"10.1109/PROC.1967.5772","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Noise induced gain saturation in the ultrasonic traveling wave amplifier","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  1967","displayDocTitle":"Noise induced gain saturation in the ultrasonic traveling wave amplifier","volume":"55","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 1967","dateOfInsertion":"28 June 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1447702/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  1967","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Noise induced gain saturation in the ultrasonic traveling wave amplifier","sourcePdf":"01447702.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.035164S","chronDate":"July  1967","isNumber":"31098","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"2","articleId":"1447702","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1967","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1447706,"authors":[{"name":"E.H.

Two permanent effects of ionizing radiation on oxidized silicon surfaces are distinguished: 1) The buildup of a positive space charge within the oxide, and 2) The creation of fast surface states at the oxide-silicon interface resulting in increased surface recombination velocity. The dependence of these effects on dose and dose rate, on bias applied during irradiation, and on structural parameters is discussed and a theory is presented which accounts for the observed features of the space-charge buildup. This theory involves trapping of holes which are generated within the oxide by the radiation. It is shown that all details of the experimental observations can be accounted for by assuming a high density of hole traps near the oxide-silicon interface which decays rapidly with distance into the oxide. Radiation-induced changes in the characteristics of MOS and junction field-effect transistors, p-n junction diodes, and p-n-p and n-p-n transistors are reported and examined in terms of the above two effects. It is shown that the charge buildup causes shifts in the operating point of MOS transistors, catastrophic increases in the reverse current of p-n junctions, and variations in their breakdown voltage. The increase in fast surface-state density is responsible for the lowering of the transconductance of MOS transistors and, in combination with the space-charge buildup, for the degradation of the current gain in bipolar transistors. It is shown that junction field-effect transistors are relatively insensitive to both effects of ionizing radiation and therefore offer the most promise for use in ionizing radiation environments.","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  1967","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  1967","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1447706/","volume":"55","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 1967","dateOfInsertion":"28 June 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Effects of ionizing radiation on oxidized silicon surfaces and planar devices","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Effects of ionizing radiation on oxidized silicon surfaces and planar devices","sourcePdf":"01447706.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.059891S","chronDate":"July  1967","isNumber":"31098","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"262","articleId":"1447706","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1967","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1447712,"authors":[{"name":"M.L.

The developmemt and design characteristics of a ten-element array system are discussed. An experimental diode array possessing good electrical and spectral match among diodes and excellent thermal dissipation is shown to provide optical gains, for main master laser modes, of at least 13 dB per array diode after coating. Temporal and spatial coherence within a GaAs laser spot, approximately 35 \u00b5 wide, is found to be adequate for array amplification purposes. The effects of array amplification on an incident coherent beam are evaluated by comparing predicted fringe patterns with observed interference patterns. The coherence of the incident beam is shown to be preserved during the amplification process.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31099","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PROC.1967.5844","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5/31099/01447774.pdf","startPage":"1420","endPage":"1425","doi":"10.1109/PROC.1967.5844","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Coherent amplification characteristics of a GaAs phased array","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  1967","displayDocTitle":"Coherent amplification characteristics of a GaAs phased array","volume":"55","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 1967","dateOfInsertion":"28 June 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1447774/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug.  1967","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Coherent amplification characteristics of a GaAs phased array","sourcePdf":"01447774.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033934S","chronDate":"Aug.  1967","isNumber":"31099","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"4","articleId":"1447774","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1967","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":1447781,"authors":[{"name":"O.

Expensive power transistors can be destroyed by undesired oscillations and instabilities. Furthermore, troublesome unwanted spurious frequencies must be avoided. The problem of stability is complicated by the fact that a class C amplifier represents the superposition of a linear class A amplifier and a nonlinear instabilities can occur. This paper discusses different physical transistor effects which could be responsible for such instabilities. It tries to clarify several aspects of the stability problem in RF power amplifiers.

Moreover, the recovery is stable, in the sense that a small error in reading sample values produces only a correspondingly small error in the recovered signal. 2) Every square-summable sequence of numbers may be transmitted at the rate of 2W per second over an ideal channel of bandwidth W Hz, by being represented as the samples of an easily constructed band-limited signal of finite energy. The practical importance of these results, together with the restrictions implicit in the sampling theorem, make it natural to ask whether the above rates cannot be improved, by passing to differently chosen sampling instants, or to bandpass or multiband (rather than bandlimited) signals, or to more elaborate computations. In this paper we draw a distinction between reconstructing a signal from its samples, and doing so in a stable way, and we argue that only stable sampling is meaningful in practice. We then prove that: 1) stable sampling cannot be performed at a rate lower than the Nyquist, 2) data cannot be transmitted as samples at a rate higher than the Nyquist, regardless of the location of sampling instants, the nature of the set of frequencies which the signals occupy, or the method of construction. These conclusions apply not merely to finite-energy, but also to bounded, signals.","doi":"10.1109/PROC.1967.5962","startPage":"1701","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5/31101/01447892.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PROC.1967.5962","endPage":"1706","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31101","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sampling, data transmission, and the Nyquist rate","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1447892/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct.  1967","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  1967","displayDocTitle":"Sampling, data transmission, and the Nyquist rate","volume":"55","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"28 June 2005","publicationDate":"Oct. 1967","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sampling, data transmission, and the Nyquist rate","sourcePdf":"01447892.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033145S","chronDate":"Oct.  1967","isNumber":"31101","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"203","articleId":"1447892","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1967","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":1447940,"authors":[{"name":"F.H.

Optimally ordered triangular factorization of sparse matrices is more efficient and offers other important computational advantages in some applications. With this method, direct solutions are computed from sparse matrix factors instead of from a full inverse matrix, thereby gaining a significant advantage in speed, computer memory requirements, and reduced round-off error. Improvements of tea to one or more in speed and problem size over present applications of the inverse can be achieved in many cases.

The approach implements the variational calculus to obtain an expression for the vector sensitivity of a scalar performance function (e.g., delay, or switching time) to changes in the vector of design parameters. Gradient methods are established for using the vector sensitivity to iteratively update the parameter vector and obtain an optimal design. It is shown that the variational approach retains, typically, an M-fold computational advantage over conventional step-and-repeat methods in determining the sensitivity of a scalar performance function to M design parameters. The approach is shown to be well adapted for incorporation into package analysis programs with matrix formulations, and vested with sufficient generality to be applicable to a wide range of switching circuit problems (e.g., low-power or large-scale integrated circuits). It is further shown that subsumed in the general class of nonlinear parameter-value synthesis problems is the class of delay-minimization problems, and that the switching time minimization problem is a special case of the classical \"time-optimal\" problem.","doi":"10.1109/PROC.1967.6016","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5/31102/01447946.pdf","startPage":"1864","endPage":"1877","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PROC.1967.6016","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31102","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Techniques for the optimal design and synthesis of switching circuits","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1447946","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1967","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1967","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1447946/","displayDocTitle":"Techniques for the optimal design and synthesis of switching circuits","volume":"55","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 1967","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"28 June 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Techniques for the optimal design and synthesis of switching circuits","sourcePdf":"01447946.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.028763S","chronDate":"Nov.  1967","isNumber":"31102","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"35","articleId":"1447946","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1967","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1447958,"authors":[{"name":"A.

Variable weights of a signal processor can be automatically adjusted by a simple adaptive technique based on the least-mean-squares (LMS) algorithm. During the adaptive process an injected pilot signal simulates a received signal from a desired \"look\" direction. This allows the array to be \"trained\" so that its directivity pattern has a main lobe in the previously specified look direction. At the same time, the array processing system can reject any incident noises, whose directions of propagation are different from the desired look direction, by forming appropriate nulls in the antenna directivity pattern. The array adapts itself to form a main lobe, with its direction and bandwidth determined by the pilot signal, and to reject signals or noises occurring outside the main lobe as well as possible in the minimum mean-square error sense. Several examples illustrate the convergence of the LMS adaptation procedure toward the corresponding Wiener optimum solutions. Rates of adaptation and misadjustments of the solutions are predicted theoretically and checked experimentally. Substantial reductions in noise reception are demonstrated in computer-simulated experiments. The techniques described are applicable to signal-receiving arrays for use over a wide range of frequencies.","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1448022/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1967","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1967","publicationDate":"Dec. 1967","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"28 June 2005","volume":"55","issue":"12","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive antenna systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive antenna systems","sourcePdf":"01448022.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.028421S","chronDate":"Dec.  1967","isNumber":"31103","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"883","articleId":"1448022","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1967","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":1448038,"authors":[{"name":"P.R.

The basic idea of constructing transmission line type transformers has been known and used for a number of years. However, such devices have not gained widespread usage, partly because their existence is not well known, but largely because of a lack of basic understanding of their operating principles in terms of elementary fundamentals as well as their capabilities and limitations. The purpose of this paper is twofold. One aim is to develop in step-by-step fashion the basic ideas of transmission line transformers from ordinary transmission line theory. The subject will be approached from the point of view of pulse response rather than ac excitation as is usually the case. Both impedance transformers and balanced-to-unbalanced (balun) transformers, including inverters, will be considered with physical insights into their operation. Several fundamental concepts will be developed and explored in detail (without mathematics), since they have a strong bearing on practical applications. The second purpose is to present new information and pulse measurements which will be useful in the design and applications of such devices, showing their capabilities and hitherto unexplored limitations, as derived from the fundamental concepts. Thus, this paper is partly supplementary to other published work and partly new work with the goal of providing a convenient fundamental understanding of these devices and their inherent potential and shortcomings. Although the intention is not to give a detailed design procedure, some approximate calculations and discussion of significant design criteria are included.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31104","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PROC.1968.6138","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5/31104/01448068.pdf","startPage":"47","endPage":"62","doi":"10.1109/PROC.1968.6138","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Transmission line pulse transformers\u2014Theory and applications","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1968","displayDocTitle":"Transmission line pulse transformers\u2014Theory and applications","volume":"56","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 1968","dateOfInsertion":"28 June 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1448068/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1968","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Transmission line pulse transformers\u2014Theory and applications","sourcePdf":"01448068.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.022693S","chronDate":"Jan.  1968","isNumber":"31104","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"15","articleId":"1448068","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1968","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1448070,"authors":[{"name":"W.

The representation contains the transmitting, receiving, and radar scattering properties of the antenna. A scattering formulation permits the antenna's power gain, directivity, effective area, and radar cross section to be expressed as a functional on the elements of its scattering matrix. For an array of antennas, the excitations which optimize its power gain and the loading network which maximizes its radar cross section are determined. The philosophic approach of circuit theory is employed for describing physical antennas. A set of canonical antenna elements having simple properties is first defined; in addition, an actual physical structure is represented as an array of canonical elements. The method is applied to the case of a Yagi-Uda array. The possibility of loading the array with active impedances is investigated.","doi":"10.1109/PROC.1968.6515","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5/31110/01448445.pdf","startPage":"1181","endPage":"1193","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PROC.1968.6515","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31110","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A network description for antenna problems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1448445","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  1968","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  1968","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1448445/","displayDocTitle":"A network description for antenna problems","volume":"56","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 1968","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"28 June 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A network description for antenna problems","sourcePdf":"01448445.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.053993S","chronDate":"July  1968","isNumber":"31110","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"22","articleId":"1448445","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1968","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1448456,"authors":[{"name":"W.K.

The mutator has the property that a nonlinear resistor is transformed into a nonlinear inductor, or a nonlinear capacitor, upon connecting this resistor across port two of an appropriate mutator. The reflector has the property that a given i-v, \u03c6-i, or q-v curve can be reflected about an arbitrary straight line through the origin. The scalor is characterized by the property that any i-v, \u03c6-i, or q-v curve can be compressed or expanded along a horizontal direction, or along a vertical direction. Using these new elements as building blocks, it is shown that any prescribed single-valued (which need not be monotonic) i-v, \u03c6-i, or q-v curve can be synthesized. Active circuit realizations for each of these new elements are given. Laboratory models of mutators, reflectors, and scalors have been built using discrete components. Oscilloscope tracings of typical mutated, reflected, and scaled i-v, \u03c6-i, and q-v curves are given. The experimental results are in good agreement with theory at relatively low operating frequencies. The practical problems that remain to be solved are the stability and frequency limitation of the present circuits.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31111","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5/31111/01448504.pdf","doi":"10.1109/PROC.1968.6574","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PROC.1968.6574","startPage":"1325","endPage":"1340","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Synthesis of new nonlinear network elements","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug.  1968","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  1968","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1448504/","displayDocTitle":"Synthesis of new nonlinear network elements","isJournal":true,"volume":"56","issue":"8","dateOfInsertion":"28 June 2005","publicationDate":"Aug. 1968","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Synthesis of new nonlinear network elements","sourcePdf":"01448504.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.04155S","chronDate":"Aug.  1968","isNumber":"31111","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"60","articleId":"1448504","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1968","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1448521,"authors":[{"name":"K.C.

This overall variance comprises: 1) the intersymbol interference variance from time spread (or dispersion in the unit impulse response of the medium); 2) the variance from frequency spread (or dispersion it the CW response of the medium); and 3) the variance from channel noise at the receiver. In order to mitigate intersymbol variance from time spread, after discussing some early and limited attempts, a review is made of the general synthesis of the infinite and finite Wiener optimal networks or equalizers using delay lines with feedforward and/or feedback taps (or their shift register digital network counterpart). Also considered are optimal finite feedforward delay line approximations to the Wiener networks, synthesized nonsequentially and sequentially using a steepest descent evolutionary network synthesis, resulting in a monotonically decreasing and convergent overall variance. Applications of these networks are shown in the transmission of speeded-up analog facsimile pictures over unconditioned voice-quality telephone lines. It is shown that the received smeared picture can be refocused or de-smeared, or its time spread mitigated, to allow overall satisfactory high-speed picture transmission. Moreover, in over-the-horizon HF ionospheric analog and/or data transmission, time spread occurs in the form of discrete multi-path reception, such as the familiar ghosts observed in television. A particularly stringent multipath comprises two equal or nearly equal magnitude paths, a situation which is actually observed in HF ionospheric communication between two ships at sea. For this case it is shown that serial data transmission with pulses thin enough to resolve the multipath achieves, with optimal equalization, an irreducible bit error ratio (BER) which is a number of orders of magnitude less than the irreducible BER of the parallel data transmission method used in all contemporary HF modems (modulators and demodulators). Design curves are given showing the intersymbol interference variance from time spread as a function of the number of taps it the delay line correction networks, along with the variance arising from channel noise, and the optimal allocation of both variances for minimal overall BER with a given number of taps for the finite realizable correction networks. Because of frequency spread, the ever-changing unit or impulse response of the medium (e.g., HF ionospheric) causes the correction or equalization networks to become aged, giving rise to frequency spread variance. This is formulated both for determinate and for random changes of the medium unit response. For transmission media having simultaneous time spread and frequency spread, the equivalent overall variance is a simple function of the time-frequency spread product of the medium. These formulas are applied to find the overall minimal BER as a function of the time-frequency product for a contemporary parallel data modem and for a new serial adaptive data transmission system (ADAPTICOM) which periodically in real time and with digital techniques rejuvenates the time spread digital correction networks. It is shown that the transmission limit of communication of the parallel data modem is for a time-frequency spread product of about 1/2000, while that for the new serial adaptive data modem is about ten times larger, or 1/200. As a result, new communication channels are opened up for serial adaptive transmission, such as the HF spectrum below the maximum usable frequency (MUF).","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Time frequency analysis","Adaptive equalizers","Data communication","Bit error rate","Modems","Network synthesis","Delay lines","Underwater communication","Telephony","Pulse modulation"]}],"doi":"10.1109/PROC.1968.6701","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5/31113/01448631.pdf","startPage":"1653","endPage":"1679","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31113","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PROC.1968.6701","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Communication in time-frequency spread media using adaptive equalization","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1448631","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Communication in time-frequency spread media using adaptive equalization","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1448631/","volume":"56","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 1968","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"28 June 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  1968","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct.  1968","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Communication in time-frequency spread media using adaptive equalization","sourcePdf":"01448631.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.066659S","chronDate":"Oct.  1968","isNumber":"31113","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"21","articleId":"1448631","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1968","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":1448639,"authors":[{"name":"B.

Numerical results are included, which illustrate many interesting features of the new design technique.","doi":"10.1109/PROC.1968.6749","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PROC.1968.6749","startPage":"1771","endPage":"1778","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5/31114/01448679.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31114","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimum scannable planar arrays with an invariant sidelobe level","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1968","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1968","displayDocTitle":"Optimum scannable planar arrays with an invariant sidelobe level","publicationDate":"Nov. 1968","dateOfInsertion":"28 June 2005","volume":"56","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1448679/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimum scannable planar arrays with an invariant sidelobe level","sourcePdf":"01448679.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.026612S","chronDate":"Nov.  1968","isNumber":"31114","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"73","articleId":"1448679","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1968","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1448684,"authors":[{"name":"M.A. Johnson","affiliation":["Heavy Military Electronics Department, General Electric Company Limited, Syracuse, NY, USA"],"firstName":"M.A.","lastName":"Johnson","id":"37087759816"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9219"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2256"}],"articleNumber":"1448684","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":9,"totalDownloads":358},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE","url":"http://www.ieee.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Beam steering","Sampling methods","Phased arrays","Frequency","Linear antenna arrays","Band pass filters","Senior members","Bandwidth","Signal resolution"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1448684","doi":"10.1109/PROC.1968.6754","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PROC.1968.6754","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31114","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5/31114/01448684.pdf","startPage":"1801","endPage":"1811","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Phased-array beam steering by multiplex sampling","abstract":"One approach to phased-array antenna beam forming and steering is to multiplex the element signals into a single channel. Appropriate \"sampling\" of the resulting multiplexed signal can provide electronically steered and shaped beams. This paper describes four practical system concepts for linear and ring arrays based on this approach and discusses significant interrelationships between the various concepts. For linear arrays of elements, the two alternatives are to frequency or time multiplex the element signals. Frequency multiplexing of the element signals produces time-multiplexed beam output signals, and time multiplexing the element signals produces frequency-multiplexed beam output signals. It is also shown here that appropriate correlation \"sampling\" may be used with either of these to produce easily one or more continuously and electronically steered signal bandwidth beam outputs. Ring arrays of elements may be multiplexed and \"sampled\" in a somewhat analogous pair of techniques. It is also pointed out that the beam steering in this case may be visualized as the linear phase steering of a set of linear phase modes into which the signal received at the array may be resolved. Ring array beam forming and steering may thus be directly understood in terms of the previous linear array techniques.","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1448684/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1968","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1968","dateOfInsertion":"28 June 2005","publicationDate":"Nov. 1968","volume":"56","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Phased-array beam steering by multiplex sampling","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Phased-array beam steering by multiplex sampling","sourcePdf":"01448684.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.022988S","chronDate":"Nov.  1968","isNumber":"31114","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"11","articleId":"1448684","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1968","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1448686,"authors":[{"name":"J.P.

Since this power formula applies to a large class of phased array antennas where the aperture field distribution can be completely specified (in normal mode form), it proves to be a powerful, unifying principle. The utility of this approach is illustrated by the simplicity with which previously known results can be derived; e.g., an infinite array of slots in a ground plane and an infinite array of flat dipoles with or without a ground plane. Further demonstrations of the usefulness of the power formula are provided by the systematic and straightforward solutions of the less-well-known problems of infinite arrays of crossed-dipole pairs and infinite arrays of open-ended rectangular waveguides. The waveguide array solution is particularly interesting because it reduces to a set of equations which are identical to those one would use to characterize an N-port network on an admittance basis (N is the number of waveguide modes). Since the power formula is derived for a parallelogram element Lattice, the resultant solution for a specific type of element is in its most general form. Expressions for the scan-dependent, dominant mode radiation admittance and the element gain function for a multimode rectangular waveguide radiator are also derived. In addition, various aspects of the waveguide array solution are investigated in the light of previous studies of infinite arrays.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A generalized approach to the analysis of infinite planar array antennas","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","doi":"10.1109/PROC.1968.6758","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5/31114/01448688.pdf","startPage":"1837","endPage":"1851","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PROC.1968.6758","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31114","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1448688","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1448688/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1968","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1968","displayDocTitle":"A generalized approach to the analysis of infinite planar array antennas","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"56","issue":"11","dateOfInsertion":"28 June 2005","publicationDate":"Nov. 1968","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A generalized approach to the analysis of infinite planar array antennas","sourcePdf":"01448688.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047214S","chronDate":"Nov.  1968","isNumber":"31114","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"50","articleId":"1448688","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1968","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":1448703,"authors":[{"name":"P.J.

In the radar case the evaluation is facilitated by use of the narrow-band approximation wherein Doppler distortion of the transmitted modulation function is neglected. However, modern-day sonar signals are usually broad-band with respect to the carrier frequency and long in duration so that the narrow-band approximation cannot be employed. This creates difficulties in both analytic and computer ambiguity function evaluations. Analytic difficulties arise from the inability to solve the appropriate integrals; computer difficulties, based on direct cross correlation, arise from the long computation time required. This paper shows how evaluation of the ambiguity functions of FM sonar signals having high time-bandwidth products can be greatly facilitated by asymptotic approximations derived on the basis of the principle of stationary phase. Application of the theory allows many seemingly difficult ambiguity evaluation problems involving highly complicated integrals to be solved rapidly using algebraic techniques. As examples of the theory, the cases of linear FM under constant target velocity conditions and hyperbolic (Doppler invariant) FM under constant target acceleration conditions are worked out. In addition, some interesting adjustable Doppler tolerant characteristics of a special modulation technique (parabolic FM) are described.","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1968","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1448758/","volume":"56","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 1968","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"28 June 2005","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1968","displayDocTitle":"Asymptotic evaluation of the ambiguity functions of high-gain FM matched filter sonar systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Asymptotic evaluation of the ambiguity functions of high-gain FM matched filter sonar systems","sourcePdf":"01448758.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.063127S","chronDate":"Dec.  1968","isNumber":"31115","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"13","articleId":"1448758","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1968","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1448799,"authors":[{"name":"W.K.

This devlopement has further led to a related image coding technique in which an image is transformed by a Hadamard matrix operator. The Hadamard matrix is a square array of plus and minus ones whose rows and columns are orthogonal to one another. A high-speed computational algorithm, similar to the fast Fourier transform algorithm, which performs the Hadamard transformation has been developed. Since only real number additions and subtractions are required with the Hadamard transform, an order of magnitude speed advantage is possible compared to the complex number Fourier transform. Transmitting the Hadamard transform of an image rather than the spatial representation of the image provides a potential toleration to channel errors and the possibility of reduced bandwidth transmission.","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1969","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1969","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1448799/","volume":"57","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 1969","dateOfInsertion":"28 June 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Hadamard transform image coding","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hadamard transform image coding","sourcePdf":"01448799.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037632S","chronDate":"Jan.  1969","isNumber":"31116","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"397","articleId":"1448799","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1969","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1448801,"authors":[{"name":"P.

The paper starts by discussing the interaction between a circuit interrupter and its associated power system. It then proceeds to describe the different methods of arc interruption. These first two parts form the background for the main purpose of this paper: to review the scientific understanding of arc interruption. Since the common ingredient in all circuit interrupters is the electric arc, the understanding of the process of circuit interruption is closely related to the scientific understanding of the behavior of arcs under both steady-state and transient conditions. Recent progress it this area is reviewed. Since arc interruption is a process during which a gas is changed from a high-temperature conducting state to a low-temperature insulating state, the knowledge of electrical breakdown of high-temperature gases is of fundamental importance, and this subject is discussed in some detail.

Two filters are used at the transmitter of a direct-feedback coder; one connected in series with the input and the other in the forward path of a feedback loop that contains the quantizer. The first filter preemphasizes the signal and determines the overload characteristic of the coder; the other filter shapes the quantization noise and sets the stability of the feedback. At the receiver a filter reconstitutes the signal spectrum and deemphasizes the noise. For television the preemphasis should he a short time-constant differentiator, the deemphasis a short time integrator, and the feedback filter a long time integrator. Conventional differential coders use a single filter in the feedback path both to provide preemphasis and to shape the feedback characteristic, so the design is a compromise. Compared with direct-feedback coding they usually have less feedback gain and a larger time constant in the preemphasis and deemphasis, consequently, the contouring noise is more visible and the streaking caused by transmission error is longer. Although only application to television is considered, the methods have wider use. General formulae are given for the output noise and optimum filter characteristics; they take into account signal spectra, frequency weighting for noise, sampling rate, quantization step size, and an overload parameter. Measurements on real coders, operating on TV signals, and digital simulations confirm the results.","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1449002/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1969","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1969","volume":"57","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"28 June 2005","publicationDate":"May 1969","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Direct-feedback coders: Design and performance with television signals","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Direct-feedback coders: Design and performance with television signals","sourcePdf":"01449002.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.052568S","chronDate":"May  1969","isNumber":"31120","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"25","articleId":"1449002","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1969","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1449007,"authors":[{"name":"M.

This paper deals with the problem of wide-band signal optimizintion for the purpose of minimizing signal degradation resulting from Doppler distortion effects. The equation for the instantaneous frequency of a Doppler-transformed signal is derived. The optimum frequency-modulation law is then shown to be the linear period modulation (it can be with equal rights called hyperbolic frequency modulation or logarithmic phase modulation). It is interesting to note that some kinds of bats use this type of signal in their \"sonar.\" Exact and approximate expressions for the spectrum of a linear-period-modulated rectangular pulse are given, and the shape of the compressed output pulse is considered. Signal degradation due to Doppler distortion is shown to be negligible in the case of linear-period-modulation pulses.

Gain and power output of the device are comparable to solid-state systems although the laser performance is hindered by thermal effects, produced by spatially nonuniform excitation of the dye, and optical losses associated with the molecular triplet state. In most of the known laser dyes, steady-state lasing is prevented by triplet state effects. The analysis of the gain of the dye laser is discussed in terms of the singlet-state absorption and fluorescence and triplet-state absorption spectra. The gain analysis is used to study the influence of the triplet state upon the critical inversion, and application of the analysis to a specific system is illustrated by the detailed discussion of the rhodamine 6G laser. A criterion for the maximum permissible triplet-state lifetime consistent with CW operation is given. The quenching of the triplet state of rhodamine 6G is shown to be rapid enough to allow CW operation, although thermal effects seem to be serious. The investigation of thermal effects is reviewed and the advantages of uniform excitation of the dye are pointed out. The minimum optical excitation power required for CW operation of a 7-cm-long rhodamine 6G laser of 2 mm diameter is estimated to be 850 watts neglecting thermal effects. A catalog of dyes, with their structures, that have been used in flashlamp-excited dye lasers is given. Various methods of tuning and mode locking the dye laser are reviewed. With a single dye a tuning range of 40 nm may be obtained by substituting a diffraction grating for one of the laser mirrors. Mode locking can be produced by placing a saturable dye absorber in the cavity.","doi":"10.1109/PROC.1969.7276","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5/31123/01449206.pdf","startPage":"1374","endPage":"1390","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31123","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PROC.1969.7276","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Flashlamp-excited organic dye lasers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1449206","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  1969","displayDocTitle":"Flashlamp-excited organic dye lasers","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1449206/","publicationDate":"Aug. 1969","dateOfInsertion":"28 June 2005","isJournal":true,"volume":"57","issue":"8","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug.  1969","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Flashlamp-excited organic dye lasers","sourcePdf":"01449206.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.040764S","chronDate":"Aug.  1969","isNumber":"31123","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"167","articleId":"1449206","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1969","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-20"},{"_id":1449208,"authors":[{"name":"J.

In this case there is a spectral representation for this field, similar to that for stationary random processes, which consists of a superposition of traveling waves. The frequency-wavenumber power spectral density provides the mean-square value for the amplitudes of these waves and is of considerable importance in the analysis of propagating waves by means of an array of sensors. The conventional method of frequency-wavenumber power spectral density estimation uses a fixed-wavenumber window and its resolution is determined essentially by the beam pattern of the array of sensors. A high-resolution method of estimation is introduced which employs a wavenumber window whose shape changes and is a function of the wavenumber at which an estimate is obtained. It is shown that the wavenumber resolution of this method is considerably better than that of the conventional method. Application of these results is given to seismic data obtained from the large aperture seismic array located in eastern Montana. In addition, the application of the high-resolution method to other areas, such as radar, sonar, and radio astronomy, is indicated.","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1449208/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug.  1969","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  1969","volume":"57","issue":"8","dateOfInsertion":"28 June 2005","publicationDate":"Aug. 1969","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"High-resolution frequency-wavenumber spectrum analysis","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High-resolution frequency-wavenumber spectrum analysis","sourcePdf":"01449208.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.05589S","chronDate":"Aug.  1969","isNumber":"31123","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"3533","articleId":"1449208","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1969","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-26"},{"_id":1449218,"authors":[{"name":"D.K.

The fabrication of a dielectric-isolated substrate, prior to diffusions, requires adequate control of the thickness of the epitaxial layer, of crowning and warpage, and of a necessarily smooth, damage-free surface. The mere juxtaposition of three or more layers of different materials, even before diffusion-induced strains, creates special problems because of coefficient-of-expansion mismatches. In addition, the substrates must pass through subsequent diffusion cycles and permit the fabrication of transistors with characteristics as good as (or better than) those made on p-n junction isolated substrates. There are three major methods of using silicon dioxide as a dielectric to separate active areas of an integrated circuit: 1) shape-back to the channels of a wafer which has had channels etched out and filled with polycrystalline silicon; 2) etch out and fill in with single crystal on an n\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">+</sup>\nwafer which has already had isolation moats created; and 3) growth of polycrystalline silicon prior to etching the isolating channels. This paper describes and compares these methods.","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1449262/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1969","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1969","publicationDate":"Sept. 1969","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"28 June 2005","volume":"57","issue":"9","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Dielectric isolated integrated circuit substrate processes","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dielectric isolated integrated circuit substrate processes","sourcePdf":"01449262.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.023424S","chronDate":"Sept.  1969","isNumber":"31124","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"9","articleId":"1449262","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1969","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1449266,"authors":[{"name":"P.

For Bell System use, beam-lead silicon nitride protected circuits are subjected to greater than 300\u00b0C long term aging as well as to high temperature steam to accelerate failures; thus encapsulants must have the same stability. A silicone-based encapsulation system which meets these rigid requirements is described in this paper. A number of resins and rubbers have been evaluated for their ability to maintain low leakage currents under high humidity conditions by measurement of the leakage on coated metallized ceramics under both high humidity and liquid water environments. An accelerated aging program was carried out to establish the long term stability of these coating systems from the standpoint of their moisture protecting abilities. The data show that the extrapolated lifetime of the silicone coatings is about the same as that established for the integrated circuits at their operating temperature. From consideration of published permeability data and the results obtained in this study, it appears that the mechanism of protection against moisture is the inactivation of sites on the surface where water can adsorb or condense to form a continuous film of water which could lead to electrical leakage currents on either the device or substrate surfaces. The best protection is thus afforded by those materials that either chemically react with the surface or are strongly adsorbed at the sites where water would normally condense.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31124","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5/31124/01449274.pdf","doi":"10.1109/PROC.1969.7344","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PROC.1969.7344","startPage":"1610","endPage":"1615","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Encapsulation of integrated circuits","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1969","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1969","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1449274/","displayDocTitle":"Encapsulation of integrated circuits","isJournal":true,"volume":"57","issue":"9","dateOfInsertion":"28 June 2005","publicationDate":"Sept. 1969","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Encapsulation of integrated circuits","sourcePdf":"01449274.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038311S","chronDate":"Sept.  1969","isNumber":"31124","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"59","articleId":"1449274","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1969","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1449276,"authors":[{"name":"T.

This paper analyzes the yield loss resulting from the presence of the epitaxial mound, a material defect found very frequently on the epitaxial surface. The peculiarity of this yield-loss mechanism, especially in a contact printing system, is that not only does it act as a crystallographic imperfection but its damage accumulates on the emulsion or chromium photomask and thus propagates to other slices. Statistical investigations on its behavior have shown that the latter effect can be more detrimental than the former in large scale integration. These results are summarized in a simple mathematical expression that is used for yield prediction. Using the model, the damage by the epitaxial mound has been shown to be reduced by an improvement in photoetching process management, though the ideal solution lies in the reduction of the mound itself or in the use of a noncontact printing system.","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1449276/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1969","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1969","publicationDate":"Sept. 1969","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"28 June 2005","volume":"57","issue":"9","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Influence of epitaxial mounds on the yield of integrated circuits","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Influence of epitaxial mounds on the yield of integrated circuits","sourcePdf":"01449276.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.061856S","chronDate":"Sept.  1969","isNumber":"31124","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"10","articleId":"1449276","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1969","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":1449283,"authors":[{"name":"K.

The algorithm is used to determine the set of filter coefficients (weights) which minimizes the mean-square error in a multidimensional linear filter. The algorithm forms an estimate of the target signal, which is assumed to be of interest, in the presence of interfering noises. It is assumed that the direction of arrival and spectral density of the target signal are known a priori. No such information is assumed to be available regarding the structure of the interfering noise field. The a priori target information is incorporated directly into the adaptation procedure using a modified gradient descent technique. The mathematical convergence properties of the algorithm are presented and a computer simulation experiment is used as an illustration. It is shown that as the number of iterations becomes large, the expected value of the adaptive solution converges to the minimum mean-square-error solution. It is further shown that the variance of the adapted filter about the optimum solution can be made arbitrarily small by appropriate choice of a scalar constant in the algorithm. These results are based on the assumption that the array signals are Gaussian and that successive time samples are statistically uncorrelated. Thus, the new algorithm is shown to converge to the optimum processor in the limit as the number of adaptations becomes large. Any disadvantage which may arise in the use of such an asymptotically optimum system is offset by the extreme simplicity of the adaptive procedure. This simplicity should prove to be particularly useful in many of the practical array processing problems recently encountered in seismic and sonar data processing.","doi":"10.1109/PROC.1969.7385","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5/31125/01449315.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PROC.1969.7385","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31125","startPage":"1696","endPage":"1704","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A simple adaptive algorithm for real-time processing in antenna arrays","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1449315","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A simple adaptive algorithm for real-time processing in antenna arrays","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  1969","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1449315/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct.  1969","isJournal":true,"volume":"57","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 1969","dateOfInsertion":"28 June 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A simple adaptive algorithm for real-time processing in antenna arrays","sourcePdf":"01449315.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039365S","chronDate":"Oct.  1969","isNumber":"31125","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"187","articleId":"1449315","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1969","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":1449318,"authors":[{"name":"B.

For angles off the normal, the model predicts the variation of the RCS with frequency, polarization, and incident angle of the illumination and further predicts an upper bound (saturation value) of the RCS with increasing roughness. The model has been collated with data collected by the Naval Research Laboratory four-frequency radar system in sea states ranging from 0 to 7. The results of the comparison have shown that the upper bound for the RCS exists and is closely approached in windspeeds in excess of 5 m/s. In addition, the data have confirmed the variation of RCS with frequency (UHF to X-band), grazing angle, and with polarization (H, V), provided that the \"tilting\" of the scattering surface by swell is taken into account in the region of shallow grazing angles.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PROC.1970.7693","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31131","startPage":"543","endPage":"550","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5/31131/01449623.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An experimental study of a sea clutter model","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1449623/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  1970","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April  1970","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"An experimental study of a sea clutter model","publicationDate":"April 1970","dateOfInsertion":"28 June 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"58","issue":"4","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An experimental study of a sea clutter model","sourcePdf":"01449623.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.080061S","chronDate":"April  1970","isNumber":"31131","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"82","articleId":"1449623","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1970","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1449648,"authors":[{"name":"J.B.

The results are specialized for the case of diffusion noise and fixed but unknown signal parameters, when it is possible to effectively utilize the theory of conditional Markov processes. Estimation by the quasi-linear theory is also discussed, the applicability of which is limited not by the Markovian condition, but by the condition of high a posteriori accuracy. In conclusion, a generalization is given of the theory for the case of adaptive detection and estimation, when the a priori information is replaced by learning. In this case, application of the theory of conditional Markov processes makes it possible to obtain, besides the previous equations of Gaussian approximation, similar equations for the unknown parameters.","doi":"10.1109/PROC.1970.7722","startPage":"670","endPage":"679","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5/31132/01449652.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PROC.1970.7722","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31132","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Detection and estimation of signals in noise when one or both are non-Gaussian","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Additive noise","Gaussian noise","Markov processes","Equations","Gaussian approximation","Parameter estimation","Signal processing","Multidimensional systems","Statistical distributions","Physics"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1449652/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1970","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1970","displayDocTitle":"Detection and estimation of signals in noise when one or both are non-Gaussian","volume":"58","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 1970","dateOfInsertion":"28 June 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Detection and estimation of signals in noise when one or both are non-Gaussian","sourcePdf":"01449652.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.04266S","chronDate":"May  1970","isNumber":"31132","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"9","articleId":"1449652","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1970","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1449653,"authors":[{"name":"T.

Using this theory the structure of the optimum detector for a known signal and long observation time in additive Gaussian noise is derived. The array processing filter employed by the optimum detector is known as the maximum-likelihood filter. This filter also has the property that it provides a minimum-variance unbiased estimate for the input signal when it is not known, which is the same as the maximum-likelihood estimate of the signal if the noise is a multidimensional Gaussian process. A series of experiments was performed using data from the large aperture seismic array to determine the effectiveness of the maximum-likelihood method relative to simpler methods such as beam-forming. These results provide significant conclusions regarding the design and processing of data from large seismic arrays. The conventional and high-resolution estimation of the frequency-wavenumber spectrum of the background microseismic noise is also presented. The diffuse structure of this spectrum is shown to aid in explaining the relative performance of array processing methods.","doi":"10.1109/PROC.1970.7730","startPage":"760","endPage":"770","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PROC.1970.7730","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31132","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5/31132/01449660.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Applications of detection and estimation theory to large array seismology","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1449660/","displayDocTitle":"Applications of detection and estimation theory to large array seismology","volume":"58","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 1970","dateOfInsertion":"28 June 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1970","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1970","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Applications of detection and estimation theory to large array seismology","sourcePdf":"01449660.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.027387S","chronDate":"May  1970","isNumber":"31132","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"13","articleId":"1449660","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1970","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1449662,"authors":[{"name":"K.

The problem is the determination of the maximum attainable value of a (suitably defined) \"reliability.\" In general the channel imposes limits on the attainable reliability in three ways: 1) by introducing \"noise\" into the system, 2) because of a \"mismatch\" between source and channel (for example, an analog data source and digital communication channel), and 3) because of \"costs\" associated with various channel inputs (for example, signal \"power\"). We assume that the system designer is allowed to interpose data processors between the source and channel input; and between the channel output and the user (called \"encoder\" and \"decoder,\" respectively) to combat these limitations. Shannon's coding theorem, which is the subject of this paper, gives an answer to this question of maximum reliability in the special case where no limit is imposed on the complexity of these processors.

Practical amplifiers are built and measurements are performed, with the results confirming the theory.","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1449779/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  1970","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  1970","dateOfInsertion":"28 June 2005","publicationDate":"July 1970","volume":"58","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Second-order distortion in CATV push-pull amplifiers","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Second-order distortion in CATV push-pull amplifiers","sourcePdf":"01449779.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.053838S","chronDate":"July  1970","isNumber":"31134","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"10","articleId":"1449779","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1970","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":1449781,"authors":[{"name":"K.A.

A singular feature of this instrument is a silicon monolithic image-sensing array that serves as the \"retina\" of the reading aid: signals from the retina are used to control an array of piezoelectric stimulators that form tactile images of printed characters. The image sensor consists of a 24\u00d76 matrix of bipolar phototransistors integrated on a chip approximately 3\u00d75 mm in size, and is designed on the basis of electrical, optical, psychological, and psychophysical considerations. The column-isolated structure incorporates a 2 to 1 aspect ratio to provide sufficient resolution and field of view for unambiguous letter-by-letter detection using a minimum number of sensor elements. A one-dimensional scanning technique minimizes fixed pattern noise and reduces the complexity of the total system. The individual 150\u00d7300 \u00b5m photosensing elements are optimized for maximum responsivity, uniformity, and dynamic range. The doping profile, featuring a 2 \u00b5m base depth and 12 \u00b5m epitaxial thickness, is based on spectral response and on a detailed electrical analysis of array operation.

The capabilities and limitations of electrooptic modulators are discussed based on a review of the physical origin of the electrooptic effect. Thermal and photoconduction phenomena, which may severely limit the operation of practical devices, are emphasized. The modulation power and bandwidth limitations using various schemes of electrooptic interaction are derived and compared. It is shown that lumped modulators are capable of efficient modulation for bandwidths up to about 1 GHz for visible wavelengths and are also attractive for their simplicity. For broader bandwidth capability the traveling wave or zigzag types of interaction become more efficient but with added complexity. Finally, acoustooptic and magnatooptic modulators are briefly discussed and compared with electrooptic modulators.","doi":"10.1109/PROC.1970.7970","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5/31137/01449900.pdf","startPage":"1440","endPage":"1457","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PROC.1970.7970","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31137","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modulators for optical communications","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1449900/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct.  1970","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  1970","displayDocTitle":"Modulators for optical communications","volume":"58","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 1970","dateOfInsertion":"28 June 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modulators for optical communications","sourcePdf":"01449900.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.1116S","chronDate":"Oct.  1970","isNumber":"31137","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"23","articleId":"1449900","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1970","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":1449902,"authors":[{"name":"H.

The objective is to provide a framework to be used in discussing and relating the analytical results presently available in the literature as well as some new, or at least not widely known, results and in motivating and guiding future work. Both digital communication and parameter and waveform estimation are considered, with the greater emphasis on the former. As necessary mathematical preliminaries, the relevant statistical channel model, the problems of spatial representation, quantum field models, and the output statistics of optical detectors are considered. For digital-communication systems, the structure and performance of optimum quantum receivers and of structured receivers, e.g., direct-and heterodyne-detection receivers with either a single detector or a detector array, are discussed and related. The simplifying approximations and assumptions required to obtain these results are emphasized. Estimation theory is considered primarily from a classical (nonquantum) viewpoint. The quadratic functional structure of the processors that result from certain approximations to the likelihood functional are emphasized. Cramer-Rao bounds on the estimation performance are considered and applied to several examples.","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct.  1970","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  1970","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1449916/","volume":"58","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 1970","dateOfInsertion":"28 June 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Communication theory for the turbulent atmosphere","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Communication theory for the turbulent atmosphere","sourcePdf":"01449916.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.066298S","chronDate":"Oct.  1970","isNumber":"31137","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"25","articleId":"1449916","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1970","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-28"},{"_id":1449918,"authors":[{"name":"T.S.

Several techniques for time multiplexing are also described. It is assumed that the transmission medium introduces only additive noise and that the detection process is signal shot noise limited. Among the formats examined the practical choices which can achieve highest information rates with lowest probabilities of error are binary, differential phase shift keying, and binary pulse position modulation. For purposes of illustrating state-of-the-art performance the design of a 4000-mile repeatered binary pulse code modulation intensity modulated system is outlined.","doi":"10.1109/PROC.1970.7988","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5/31137/01449918.pdf","startPage":"1666","endPage":"1683","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PROC.1970.7988","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31137","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Wide-band optical communication systems: Part I\u2014Time division multiplexing","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1449918/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct.  1970","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  1970","displayDocTitle":"Wide-band optical communication systems: Part I\u2014Time division multiplexing","volume":"58","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 1970","dateOfInsertion":"28 June 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wide-band optical communication systems: Part I\u2014Time division multiplexing","sourcePdf":"01449918.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.042854S","chronDate":"Oct.  1970","isNumber":"31137","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"27","articleId":"1449918","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1970","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1449919,"authors":[{"name":"O.E.

The most promising alternatives are heterodyne systems operating at the 10.6 \u00b5 wavelength, and direct-detection systems at near-infrared or visible wavelengths. Feasible links include horizontal, ground-to-satellite, and satellite-to-ground (or aircraft) geometries. System requirements and atmospheric effects are reviewed.

The purpose of this paper is to evaluate such suggestions quantitatively. Changes in physical properties of materials upon cooling to low temperatures have been analyzed to determine their impact on the parameters which control the performance of logical circuitry. The following topics have been considered: electrical conductivity, thermal conductivity, thermal energy, heat transfer, superconductivity, liquid helium, low-gap high-mobility semiconductors, and thermal activation of atomic motion.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The role of low temperatures in the operation of logic circuitry","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","doi":"10.1109/PROC.1970.8063","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5/31139/01449993.pdf","startPage":"1914","endPage":"1932","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PROC.1970.8063","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31139","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1449993","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1449993/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1970","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1970","displayDocTitle":"The role of low temperatures in the operation of logic circuitry","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"58","issue":"12","dateOfInsertion":"28 June 2005","publicationDate":"Dec. 1970","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The role of low temperatures in the operation of logic circuitry","sourcePdf":"01449993.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.051859S","chronDate":"Dec.  1970","isNumber":"31139","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"28","articleId":"1449993","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1970","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"}]
