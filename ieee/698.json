We present the first phase of a system with the potential to attribute energy-related events to an individual occupant of a space and provide occupant-specific energy usage feedback in an uninstrumented space (e.g., home or office). This initial phase focuses on collecting the electromagnetic field (EMF) radiated by several common appliances to determine a unique signature for each appliance. It also implements a machine learning algorithm to classify appliances from an incoming EMF data file. The proposed approach has been prototyped with hardware realization. The results obtained on tested appliances indicate the EMF sensor's ability and potential to develop a system for providing occupant-specific energy feedback.","doi":"10.1109/JSEN.2014.2379113","startPage":"3573","endPage":"3581","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/7361/7086408/06980072.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSEN.2014.2379113","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7086408","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"EMF Signature for Appliance Classification","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Home appliances","Monitoring","Energy consumption","Sensors","Buildings","Fluorescent lamps","Electricity"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["domestic appliances","electromagnetic fields","energy consumption","learning (artificial intelligence)","power engineering computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["EMF signature","appliance classification","intrusive appliance load monitoring system","intrusive appliance load classification system","nonintrusive appliance load monitoring system","nonintrusive appliance load classification system","machine learning algorithm","electromagnetic field data file","hardware realization","EMF sensor ability"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Energy consumption","EMF signatures","Decision Trees","EMF sensor"]},{"kwd":["Energy consumption","EMF signatures","Decision Trees","EMF sensor"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6980072/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 December 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2015","displayDocTitle":"EMF Signature for Appliance Classification","volume":"15","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/6980072/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","dateOfInsertion":"01 May 2015","accessionNumber":"15106159","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"EMF Signature for Appliance Classification","sourcePdf":"jsen-kulkarni-2379113-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.048238S","chronDate":"June  2015","xplore-pub-id":"7361","isNumber":"7086408","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7361","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"7086408","articleId":"6980072","onlineDate":"09 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6980076,"authors":[{"name":"Mei-Ju Shih","affiliation":["Graduate Institute of Communication Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Mei-Ju","lastName":"Shih","id":"37085411501"},{"name":"Guan-Yu Lin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Guan-Yu","lastName":"Lin","id":"37856320700"},{"name":"Hung-Yu Wei","affiliation":["Graduate Institute of Communication Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Hung-Yu","lastName":"Wei","id":"37281361800"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2162-2337"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2162-2345"}],"articleNumber":"6980076","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":910},"abstract":"In Device-to-Device (D2D) broadcast communications, the design of Medium Access Control (MAC) protocol is quite challenging since it is urged on alleviating data collision under the constraints of no feedback messages, no central coordination, and half-duplex transmission. We propose a multi-channel MAC protocol for data channel competition. Theoretical and simulation results show that this protocol resolves all channel collisions in only a few iterations. Moreover, the collision resolution time is dominated by the number of channels, rather than the number of D2D transmitters. Thus, even in scenarios with densely-distributed D2D devices, the proposed protocol can guarantee short collision resolution time.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Convergence","Media Access Protocol","Approximation methods","Radio transmitters","Receivers","Delays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["access protocols","broadcast communication","mobile communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["medium access control protocol","distributed multichannel feedbackless MAC protocol","device-to-device broadcast communications","D2D broadcast communications","data collision","data channel competition"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Device-to-Device Communications","Resource allocation","Multi-Channel Medium Access Control","Half-Duplex","Broadcast Communications"]},{"kwd":["Device-to-device communications","resource allocation","multi-channel medium access control","half-duplex","broadcast communications"]}],"doi":"10.1109/LWC.2014.2379614","publicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/5962382/7044619/06980076.pdf","startPage":"102","endPage":"105","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7044619","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LWC.2014.2379614","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Distributed Multi-Channel Feedbackless MAC Protocol for D2D Broadcast Communications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6980076","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Distributed Multi-Channel Feedbackless MAC Protocol for D2D Broadcast Communications","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6980076/","volume":"4","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Feb. 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6980076/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"14946575","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 December 2014","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003848","fundingName":"Industrial Technology Research Institute"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Distributed Multi-Channel Feedbackless MAC Protocol for D2D Broadcast Communications","sourcePdf":"lwc-wei-2379614-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044151S","chronDate":"Feb.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"5962382","isNumber":"7044619","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5962382","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"7044619","articleId":"6980076","onlineDate":"09 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6980077,"authors":[{"name":"Dejan Dov\u017ean","affiliation":["Laboratory of Autonomous Mobile Systems, Faculty of Electrical Engineering, University of Ljubljana, Ljubljana, Slovenia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/91/7287855/6980077/dovza-small.gif","p":["Dejan Dov\u017ean received the B.Sc. degree from the Faculty of\n Electrical Engineering, University of Ljubljana, Ljubljana, Slovenia, in 2008.

Improved control and optimization of WWTP lead to increased pollutant removal, a reduced need for chemicals as well as energy savings. An important step toward the optimal functioning of a WWTP is to minimize the influence of sensor faults on the control quality. To achieve this, a fault-detection system should be implemented. In this paper, the idea of using an evolving method as a base for the fault-detection/monitoring system is tested. The system is based on the evolving fuzzy model method. This method allows us to model the nonlinear relations between the variables with the Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy model. The method uses basic evolving mechanisms to add and remove clusters and the adaptation mechanism to adapt the clusters' and local models' parameters. The proposed fault-detection system is tested on measured data from a real WWTP. The results indicate the potential improvement of the WWTP's control during a sensor malfunction.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6980077/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 December 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6980077/","dateOfInsertion":"02 October 2015","publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","accessionNumber":"15489091","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"23","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Implementation of an Evolving Fuzzy Model (eFuMo) in a Monitoring System for a Waste-Water Treatment Process","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Implementation of an Evolving Fuzzy Model (eFuMo) in a Monitoring System for a Waste-Water Treatment Process","sourcePdf":"tfuzz-dovzan-2379252-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.136966S","chronDate":"Oct.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"91","isNumber":"7287855","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"91","citationCount":"78","xplore-issue":"7287855","articleId":"6980077","onlineDate":"09 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-04"},{"_id":6980079,"authors":[{"name":"Zhao Zhou","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Advanced Optical Communication System and Networks, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Zhao","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37856594600"},{"name":"Meihua Bi","affiliation":["College of Communication Engineering, Hangzhou Dianzi University, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Meihua","lastName":"Bi","id":"38010876800"},{"name":"Shilin Xiao","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Advanced Optical Communication System and Networks, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Shilin","lastName":"Xiao","id":"37404041900"},{"name":"Yunhao Zhang","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Advanced Optical Communication System and Networks, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Yunhao","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37085527081"},{"name":"Weisheng Hu","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Advanced Optical Communication System and Networks, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Weisheng","lastName":"Hu","id":"37273483200"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1041-1135"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0174"}],"articleNumber":"6980079","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":28,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":755},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Photonics Society","url":"http://www.PhotonicsSociety.org"}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Experimental Demonstration of Symmetric 100-Gb/s DML-Based TWDM-PON System","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6980079","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Chirp","Passive optical networks","Optical attenuators","Optical fiber dispersion","Optical filters","Optical signal processing","Optical distortion"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distortion","fibre lasers","light interferometers","optical fibre dispersion","passive optical networks","time division multiplexing","wavelength division multiplexing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["symmetric DML-based TWDM-PON system","directly modulated lasers","time-and-wavelength division multiplexed passive optical network system","none-return-to-zero signals","bypass delay interferometer","optical line terminal","signal distortion mitigation","DML chirp","fiber chromatic dispersion","error free transmission","single mode fiber","power budget","splitting ratio","burst-mode operation","bit rate 100 Gbit/s"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["time and wavelength division multiplexed passive optical network (TWDM-PON)","directly modulated laser (DML)","chirp management"]},{"kwd":["Time and wavelength division multiplexed passive optical network (TWDM-PON)","directly modulated laser (DML)","chirp management"]}],"abstract":"In this letter, first, the symmetric 100-Gb/s time and wavelength-division-multiplexed passive optical network system is experimentally demonstrated, based on the directly modulated lasers (DMLs) modulated by 25-Gb/s none-return-to-zero signals.

This contribution presents the underlying concepts and ideas to provide the predictability, flexibility, and creative freedom in order to elevate analog circuit design to the next step. A circuit generation algorithm is presented, which allows a full design-space exploration. Furthermore, an isomorphism algorithm is developed, which reduces a given set of circuits to its unique being one of the first methodologies addressing this issue. Thus, the algorithm handles vast amounts of circuits in a very efficient manner. The results demonstrate the claimed feasibility and applicability of the synthesis framework in general and in the context of system design.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/43/7012128/06980087.pdf","startPage":"213","endPage":"226","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","doi":"10.1109/TCAD.2014.2376987","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCAD.2014.2376987","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7012128","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6980087","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FEATS: Framework for Explorative Analog Topology Synthesis","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Topology","Abstracts","Libraries","Algorithm design and analysis","Ports (Computers)","Analog circuits","Engines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analogue circuits","network synthesis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["framework for explorative analog topology synthesis","FEATS","automated analog circuit synthesis","analog synthesis approaches","stochastic-driven circuit generation methods","analog circuit design","circuit generation algorithm","design-space exploration","isomorphism algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Synthesis","design for space exploration","Symmetry detection","performance optimization","symbolic techniques"]},{"kwd":["Design for space exploration","performance optimization","symbolic techniques","symmetry detection","synthesis"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6980087/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 December 2014","displayDocTitle":"FEATS: Framework for Explorative Analog Topology Synthesis","volume":"34","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/6980087/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2015","accessionNumber":"14854513","dateOfInsertion":"16 January 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FEATS: Framework for Explorative Analog Topology Synthesis","sourcePdf":"tcad-meissner-2376987-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.16941S","chronDate":"Feb.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"43","isNumber":"7012128","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"7012128","articleId":"6980087","onlineDate":"09 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6980089,"authors":[{"name":"Christian Monzio Compagnoni","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Elettronica, Informazione e Bioingegneria, Politecnico di Milano, Milan, Italy"],"firstName":"Christian","lastName":"Monzio Compagnoni","id":"37085335600"},{"name":"Giovanni M.

The proposed approach is based on a new binary optimization method inspired by fractional-order Darwinian particle swarm optimization (FODPSO). The overall accuracy (OA) of a support vector machine (SVM) classifier on validation samples is used as fitness values in order to evaluate the informativity of different groups of bands. In order to show the capability of the proposed method, two different applications are considered. In the first application, the proposed feature selection approach is directly carried out on the input hyperspectral data. The most informative bands selected from this step are classified by the SVM. In the second application, the main shortcoming of using attribute profiles (APs) for spectral-spatial classification is addressed. In this case, a stacked vector of the input data and an AP with all widely used attributes are created. Then, the proposed feature selection approach automatically chooses the most informative features from the stacked vector. Experimental results successfully confirm that the proposed feature selection technique works better in terms of classification accuracies and CPU processing time than other studied methods without requiring the number of desired features to be set a priori by users.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel7/36/7001732/06980119.pdf","startPage":"2935","endPage":"2947","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2014.2367010","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2014.2367010","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7001732","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6980119","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Novel Feature Selection Approach Based on FODPSO and SVM","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Support vector machines","Training","Feature extraction","Vectors","Hyperspectral imaging","Accuracy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data reduction","feature selection","geophysical image processing","hyperspectral imaging","image classification","particle swarm optimisation","support vector machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feature selection approach","dimensionality reduction","redundancy reduction","hyperspectral data","binary optimization method","fractional-order Darwinian particle swarm optimization","FODPSO","overall accuracy","support vector machine","SVM classifier","attribute profiles","spectral-spatial classification","CPU processing time"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Attribute profile (AP)","automatic classification","feature extraction","hyperspectral image analysis","random forest (RF) classifier","spectral\u2013spatial classification"]},{"kwd":["Attribute profile (AP)","automatic classification","feature extraction","hyperspectral image analysis","random forest (RF) classifier","spectral\u2013spatial classification"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6980119/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 December 2014","displayDocTitle":"A Novel Feature Selection Approach Based on FODPSO and SVM","volume":"53","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/6980119/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"14847911","dateOfInsertion":"07 January 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Icelandic Research Fund for Graduate Students"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel Feature Selection Approach Based on FODPSO and SVM","sourcePdf":"tgrs-benediktsson-2367010-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.101216S","chronDate":"May  2015","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"7001732","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"77","xplore-issue":"7001732","articleId":"6980119","onlineDate":"09 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6980120,"authors":[{"name":"Ignacio Llatser","affiliation":["NaNoNetworking Center in Catalunya (N3Cat), Universitat Polit\u00e8cnica de Catalunya, Barcelona, Spain"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/7010064/6980120/llats-2379271_print-small.gif","p":["\nIgnacio Llatser was born in Vinar\u00f2s, Spain, in 1984.

Due to their small size of just a few micrometers, graphennas allow the implementation of wireless communications among nanosystems, leading to a novel paradigm known as Graphene-enabled Wireless Communications (GWC). In this paper, an analytical framework is developed to evaluate how the channel capacity of a GWC system scales as its dimensions shrink. In particular, we study how the unique propagation of SPP waves in graphennas will impact the channel capacity. Next, we further compare these results with respect to the case when metallic antennas are used, in which these plasmonic effects do not appear. In addition, asymptotic expressions for the channel capacity are derived in the limit when the system dimensions tend to zero. In this scenario, necessary conditions to ensure the feasibility of GWC networks are found. Finally, using these conditions, new guidelines are derived to explore the scalability of various parameters, such as transmission range and transmitted power. These results may be helpful for designers of future GWC systems and networks.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2014.2379271","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2014.2379271","startPage":"324","endPage":"333","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on

The formulated problem falls into the category of nonconvex mixed-integer optimization, which is in general very hard to solve. In this paper, we propose an alternating optimization scheme to find at least a local optimal point in the sense that no single femto base station can increase the system performance by changing its RA and PC strategy. Starting from a special initial RA scheme to handle cross-tier interference, PC and RA are then updated alternately. In particular, we find the optimal power for fixed RA scheme distributedly during the PC subroutine and greedily move to the most beneficial neighboring RA scheme in the RA subroutine. The proposed algorithm converges by producing monotonic improvement of system performance. Furthermore, to reduce the implementation complexity and feedback overhead, we propose a variant local search algorithm, which greatly reduces the computational burden without causing a significant loss of performance in the simulations.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Power Control and Resource Allocation for Outage Balancing in Femtocell Networks","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on

The expense emerges in designing the transition between consecutive symbols. The price can be either the reduction of spectral efficiency (SE) with symbol extension for better transition or the introduction of intersymbol and intercarrier interference (ISI and ICI) due to reduced cyclic prefix (CP) size. In this paper, we propose a time-asymmetric and per-subcarrier (per-SC) pulse-shaping method to minimize the introduced interference without sacrificing SE and OOB performances. Although time-asymmetric pulse reduces the interference due to shortened CP by exploiting the asymmetry in channel delay profile, it causes spectral growth. Thus, the time asymmetry of the pulse-shaping function is gradually increased for the inner SCs that have wider spectral room to the OOB region. A generalized Kaiser window with adjustable time asymmetry is introduced to the provided framework. Theoretical and simulation results showed that the proposed technique achieves superior BER performance while achieving the same level of OOB suppression of pulse shaping and SE of plain OFDM.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/7323911/06980135.pdf","startPage":"5070","endPage":"5082","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2014.2380356","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2014.2380356","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7323911","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6980135","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Time-Asymmetric and Subcarrier-Specific Pulse Shaping in OFDM-Based Waveforms","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Pulse shaping methods","OFDM","Interference","Smoothing methods","Shape","Delays","Multipath channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error statistics","intercarrier interference","interference suppression","intersymbol interference","OFDM modulation","pulse shaping","radiocommunication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["subcarrier-specific pulse shaping","time-asymmetric pulse shaping","OFDM-based waveform","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing system","out-of-band emission suppression","spectral efficiency reduction","symbol extension","intersymbol interference minimization","intercarrier interference","cyclic prefix size reduction","generalized Kaiser window","adjustable time asymmetry","BER performance","wireless communication"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Asymmetric pulse shaping","generalized Kaiser window","multipath delay spread","out-of-band emission"]},{"kwd":["Asymmetric pulse shaping","generalized Kaiser window","multipath delay spread","out-of-band (OOB) emission"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6980135/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 December 2014","displayDocTitle":"Time-Asymmetric and Subcarrier-Specific Pulse Shaping in OFDM-Based Waveforms","volume":"64","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/6980135/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2015","accessionNumber":"15587035","dateOfInsertion":"10 November 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"InterDigital Communications Inc."}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Time-Asymmetric and Subcarrier-Specific Pulse Shaping in OFDM-Based Waveforms","sourcePdf":"tvt-guvenkaya-2380356-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.079042S","chronDate":"Nov.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"7323911","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"7323911","articleId":"6980135","onlineDate":"09 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6980136,"authors":[{"name":"Mehrdad Shariat","affiliation":["Institute for Communication Systems, Department of Electronic Engineering, University of Surrey, Guildford, U.K."],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/7323911/6980136/shari-2379013-small.gif","p":["\n\nMehrdad Shariat received the B.Sc. degree in telecommunications engineering from Iran University of Science and Technology, Tehran, Iran, in 2005 and the Ph.D. degree in mobile communications from the University of Surrey, Guildford, U.K., in 2010.","Since 2010, he has been a Research Fellow with the Institute for Communication Systems, home of the 5G Innovation Centre, University of Surrey.

Here, we propose a framework for joint radio resource management, where we systematically decompose the problem in BH and access links. To simplify the analysis, the procedure is tackled in two stages. At the first stage, the joint optimization problem is formulated for a point-to-point scenario where each small cell is simply associated with a single user. It is shown that the optimization can be decomposed into separate power and subchannel allocation in both BH and access links, where a set of rate-balancing parameters in conjunction with duration of transmission governs the coupling across both links. Moreover, a novel algorithm is proposed based on grouping the cells to achieve rate balancing in different small cells. Next, in the second stage, the problem is generalized for multiaccess small cells. Here, each small cell is associated with multiple users to provide the service. The optimization is similarly decomposed into separate subchannel and power allocation by employing auxiliary slicing variables. It is shown that similar algorithms, as in the previous stage, are applicable by a slight change with the aid of slicing variables. Additionally, for the special case of line-of-sight BH links, simplified expressions for subchannel and power allocation are presented. The developed concepts are evaluated by extensive simulations in different case studies from full orthogonalization to dynamic clustering and full reuse in the downlink, and it is shown that the proposed framework provides significant improvement over the benchmark cases.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6980136/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 December 2014","volume":"64","issue":"11","isOpenAccess":true,"accessionNumber":"15587041","publicationDate":"Nov. 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6980136/","dateOfInsertion":"10 November 2015","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Joint TDD Backhaul and Access Optimization in Dense Small-Cell Networks","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000780","fundingName":"European Commission"},{"fundingName":"7th Framework Program through the ICT Project iJOIN","grantNumber":"317941"},{"fundingName":"University of Surrey, Guildford, U.K."},{"fundingName":"5GIC"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Joint TDD Backhaul and Access Optimization in Dense Small-Cell Networks","sourcePdf":"tvt-shariat-2379013-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.111894S","chronDate":"Nov.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"7323911","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"35","xplore-issue":"7323911","articleId":"6980136","onlineDate":"09 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6980137,"authors":[{"name":"Wenbo Shi","affiliation":["Smart Grid Energy Research Center, University of California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5165411/7086423/6980137/shi-2373150-small.gif","p":["Wenbo Shi (S\u201908) received the B.S. degree from Xi\u2019an Jiaotong University, Xi\u2019an, China, and the M.A.Sc. degree from the University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada, in 2009 and 2011, respectively, both in electrical engineering.

Solving it in a centralized manner does not only require high computational capabilities at the microgrid central controller (MGCC), but may also infringe customer privacy. Existing distributed approaches, on the other hand, assume that all generations and loads are connected to one bus, and ignore the underlying power distribution network and the associated power flow and system operational constraints. Consequently, the schedules produced by those algorithms may violate those constraints and thus are not feasible in practice. Therefore, the focus of this paper is on the design of a distributed energy management strategy (EMS) for the optimal operation of microgrids with consideration of the distribution network and the associated constraints. Specifically, we formulate microgrid energy management as an optimal power flow problem, and propose a distributed EMS where the MGCC and the local controllers jointly compute an optimal schedule. We also provide an implementation of the proposed distributed EMS based on IEC 61850. As one demonstration, we apply the proposed distributed EMS to a real microgrid in Guangdong Province, China, consisting of photovoltaics, wind turbines, diesel generators, and a battery energy storage system. The simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness and fast convergence of the proposed distributed EMS.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7086423","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSG.2014.2373150","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid","pdfPath":"/iel7/5165411/7086423/06980137.pdf","startPage":"1137","endPage":"1146","doi":"10.1109/TSG.2014.2373150","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed Optimal Energy Management in Microgrids","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2015","displayDocTitle":"Distributed Optimal Energy Management in Microgrids","volume":"6","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/6980137/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15057492","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6980137/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 December 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003702","fundingName":"Research and Development Program of the Korea Institute of Energy Research","grantNumber":"B4-2411-01"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed Optimal Energy Management in Microgrids","sourcePdf":"tsg-shi-2373150-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.128628S","chronDate":"May  2015","xplore-pub-id":"5165411","isNumber":"7086423","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5165411","citationCount":"290","xplore-issue":"7086423","articleId":"6980137","onlineDate":"09 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-08"},{"_id":6980225,"authors":[{"name":"S\u00e9bastien Rufiange","affiliation":["University of Bordeaux, LaBRI, UMR, France"],"firstName":"S\u00e9bastien","lastName":"Rufiange","id":"37077522300"},{"name":"Guy Melan\u00e7on","affiliation":["University of Bordeaux, LaBRI, UMR, France"],"firstName":"Guy","lastName":"Melan\u00e7on","id":"37283186100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6150-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6980225","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":557},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6980225","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Software","Visualization","Animation","Couplings","History","Color","Taxonomy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer graphics","directed graphs","public domain software","source code (software)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["AniMatrix","matrix-based visualization","software evolution","software project","weighted digraphs","generic visualization","source code","open-source repositories"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["network visualization","matrix visualization","software visualization","software evolution","software design"]}],"abstract":"Software designs are ever changing to adapt to new environments and requirements. Tracking and understanding changes in modules and relationships in a software project is difficult, but even more so when the software goes through several types of changes. The typical complexity and size of software also makes it harder to grasp software evolution patterns. In this paper, we present an interactive matrix-based visualization technique that, combined with animation, depicts how software designs evolve. For example, it shows which new modules and couplings are added and removed over time. Our generic visualization supports dynamic and weighted digraphs and is applied in the context of software evolution. Analyzing source code changes is important to determine the software's structural organization and identify quality issues over time. To demonstrate our approach, we explore open-source repositories and discuss some of our findings regarding these evolving software designs.","doi":"10.1109/VISSOFT.2014.30","startPage":"137","publicationTitle":"2014 Second IEEE Working Conference on Software Visualization","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 Second IEEE Working Conference on Software Visualization","pdfPath":"/iel7/6970369/6980193/06980225.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VISSOFT.2014.30","endPage":"146","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6980193","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"AniMatrix: A Matrix-Based Visualization of Software Evolution","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6980225/","chronOrPublicationDate":"29-30 Sept. 2014","displayDocTitle":"AniMatrix: A Matrix-Based Visualization of Software Evolution","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6980225/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"14819480","conferenceDate":"29-30 Sept. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2014","publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"AniMatrix: A Matrix-Based Visualization of Software Evolution","confLoc":"Victoria, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"6150a137.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070583S","chronDate":"29-30 Sept. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6970369","isNumber":"6980193","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6970369","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"6980193","articleId":"6980225","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":6980319,"authors":[{"name":"Haruno Kataoka","affiliation":["Department of Informatics, University of Electro-Communications, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Haruno","lastName":"Kataoka","id":"37410381300"},{"name":"Yohei Ogawa","affiliation":["Department of Informatics, University of Electro-Communications, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Yohei","lastName":"Ogawa","id":"37085432033"},{"name":"Isao Echizen","affiliation":["Digital Content and Media Science Research Division, National Institute of Informatics, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Isao","lastName":"Echizen","id":"37337622900"},{"name":"Tetsuji Kuboyama","affiliation":["Computer Centre, Gakushuin University, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Tetsuji","lastName":"Kuboyama","id":"37396243900"},{"name":"Hiroshi Yoshiura","affiliation":["Department of Informatics, University of Electro-Communications, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Hiroshi","lastName":"Yoshiura","id":"37328873800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-4223-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6980319","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":158},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6980319","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Educational institutions","Silicon","Electronic mail","Security","Data models","Twitter"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Internet","social networking (online)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["deanonymization model","World Wide Web","public ally accessible information","scientific analysis","sophisticated data centric services","personal data","social network deanonymisation","transparency","anonymity","external information"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["social network","privacy","Security"]}],"abstract":"Personal data to be used for sophisticated data-centric services is typically anonym zed to ensure the privacy of the underlying individuals. However, the degree of protection against de-anonymization is uncertain because de-anonymization has not been explicitly modelled for scientific analysis and because the information that attackers might use is not well defined given that they can use a wide variety of external information sources such as public ally accessible information on the web. We have developed a system that de-anonymizes anonymous posts on social networks with a considerably high precision rate. We analysed this system and its behaviour and, on the basis of our findings, we clarified a de-anonymization model and used it to clarify the effects of external information on anonymity. We also identified the limitation of anonymization under conditions of external information being available and clarified the role of transparency can play in controlling the use of personal data.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6980232","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ARES.2014.70","publicationTitle":"2014 Ninth International Conference on Availability, Reliability and Security","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 Ninth International Conference on Availability, Reliability and Security","pdfPath":"/iel7/6969844/6980232/06980319.pdf","startPage":"461","endPage":"467","doi":"10.1109/ARES.2014.70","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Effects of External Information on Anonymity and Role of Transparency with Example of Social Network De-anonymisation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 Sept. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Effects of External Information on Anonymity and Role of Transparency with Example of Social Network De-anonymisation","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"8-12 Sept. 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6980319/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","accessionNumber":"14819394","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2014","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6980319/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Effects of External Information on Anonymity and Role of Transparency with Example of Social Network De-anonymisation","confLoc":"Fribourg, Switzerland","sourcePdf":"4223a461.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049492S","chronDate":"8-12 Sept. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6969844","isNumber":"6980232","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6969844","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6980232","articleId":"6980319","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6980363,"authors":[{"name":"Rui Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong SAR"],"firstName":"Rui","lastName":"Zhang","id":"38548103900"},{"name":"Wen Qi","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong SAR"],"firstName":"Wen","lastName":"Qi","id":"37085520325"},{"name":"Jianping Wang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong SAR"],"firstName":"Jianping","lastName":"Wang","id":"37406463900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6204-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-6203-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1092-1648"}],"articleNumber":"6980363","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":275},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","Channel capacity","Receivers","Entropy","Signal to noise ratio","Tuning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["capacity management (computers)","channel capacity","cloud computing","computer network management","estimation theory","risk management","virtual machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fine-tuned parameter","virtualization platform","automated capacity estimation","data rate","automated parameter tuning","APFC3","autoprofiling framework of covert channel capacity","information leakage","cloud service provider","cloud platform","disk bus","memory bus","CPU cache","coresident virtual machine","automated capacity profiler","cloud computing","cross-VM covert channel risk assessment"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cross-VM covert channel","Capacity estimation","Shannon entropy"]}],"abstract":"Cross-VM covert channels leverage physical resources shared between co-resident virtual machines, like CPU cache, memory bus, and disk bus, to leak information. The capacity of cross-VM covert channels varies on different cloud platforms. Thus, it is hard for cloud service providers to estimate the risk of information leakage caused by cross-VM covert channels on their own platforms. In this paper, we develop an Auto Profiling Framework of Covert Channel Capacity (APFC3) to automatically profile the maximum capacities of various cross-VM covert channels on different cloud platforms. The framework consists of automated parameter tuning for various cross-VM covert channels to achieve high data rate and automated capacity estimation of those cross-VM covert channels. We evaluate the proposed framework by constructing fine-tuned cross-VM covert channels on different virtualization platforms and comparing the optimized achievable data rate with the estimated maximum capacity computed using the proposed framework. The experiments show that in most cases, the capacity estimated using APFC3 is very close to the achieved data rate of constructed covert channels with fine-tuned parameters.","doi":"10.1109/ICNP.2014.24","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 22nd International Conference on Network Protocols","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 22nd International Conference on Network Protocols","pdfPath":"/iel7/6975723/6980338/06980363.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNP.2014.24","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6980338","startPage":"25","endPage":"36","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cross-VM Covert Channel Risk Assessment for Cloud Computing: An Automated Capacity Profiler","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6980363","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Cross-VM Covert Channel Risk Assessment for Cloud Computing: An Automated Capacity Profiler","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 Oct. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6980363/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"21-24 Oct. 2014","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","accessionNumber":"14819612","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6980363/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cross-VM Covert Channel Risk Assessment for Cloud Computing: An Automated Capacity Profiler","confLoc":"Raleigh, NC, USA","sourcePdf":"6204a025.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.079174S","chronDate":"21-24 Oct. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6975723","isNumber":"6980338","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6975723","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6980338","articleId":"6980363","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6980365,"authors":[{"name":"Jinsong Han","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Xi\u2019 an Jiaotong University, China"],"firstName":"Jinsong","lastName":"Han","id":"37290381600"},{"name":"Han Ding","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Xi\u2019 an Jiaotong University, China"],"firstName":"Han","lastName":"Ding","id":"37855758100"},{"name":"Chen Qian","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Kentucky, Lexington, Ky, USA"],"firstName":"Chen","lastName":"Qian","id":"37085449889"},{"name":"Dan Ma","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Xi\u2019 an Jiaotong University, China"],"firstName":"Dan","lastName":"Ma","id":"37085473929"},{"name":"Wei Xi","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Xi\u2019 an Jiaotong University, China"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Xi","id":"37302270300"},{"name":"Zhi Wang","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Xi\u2019 an Jiaotong University, China"],"firstName":"Zhi","lastName":"Wang","id":"38247938700"},{"name":"Zhiping Jiang","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Xi\u2019 an Jiaotong University, China"],"firstName":"Zhiping","lastName":"Jiang","id":"38247914000"},{"name":"Longfei Shangguan","affiliation":["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong"],"firstName":"Longfei","lastName":"Shangguan","id":"38229627000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6204-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-6203-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1092-1648"}],"articleNumber":"6980365","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":30,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":462},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6980365","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Correlation","Doppler shift","Frequency estimation","Radiofrequency identification","Protocols","Estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["behavioural sciences computing","customer profiles","protocols","radiofrequency identification"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CBID","customer behavior identification system","passive RFID tags","Doppler effect based protocol","Doppler frequency estimation algorithm","multiRSS based tag localization protocol","tag clustering algorithm"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6980338","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 22nd International Conference on Network Protocols","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 22nd International Conference on Network Protocols","doi":"10.1109/ICNP.2014.26","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"CBID: A Customer Behavior Identification System Using Passive Tags","startPage":"47","endPage":"58","pdfPath":"/iel7/6975723/6980338/06980365.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNP.2014.26","abstract":"Different from online shopping, in-store shopping has few ways to collect the customer behaviors before purchase.

The design innovations of this work include a Doppler effect based protocol to detect tag movements, an accurate Doppler frequency estimation algorithm, a multi-RSS based tag localization protocol, and a tag clustering algorithm using cosine similarity.

While enabling reusability-driven spectrum allocation, truthful spectrum auction designs are also expected to provide price fairness for homogeneous channels, online auction with unknown and dynamic spectrum supplies, and bounded system performance. Existing works, however, lack of such designs due to the inherent technically challenging nature. In this paper, we study the problem of allocating channels to spectrum users with homogeneous/heterogenous demands in a setting where idle channels are arriving dynamically, with the goal of maximizing social welfare. Taking spectrum reusability into consideration, we present a suite of novel and efficient spectrum auction algorithms that achieve fair pricing for homogeneous channels, strategy proofness, online spectrum auction with a dynamic supply and a log approximation to the optimal social welfare. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to design truthful spectrum auctions enabling fair payments for homogenous channels and spectrum reusability with dynamic spectrum supply. Experimental results show that our schemes outperform the existing benchmarks by providing almost perfect fairness of pricing for both single- and multi-unit demand spectrum users.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6980338","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNP.2014.45","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 22nd International Conference on Network Protocols","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 22nd International Conference on Network Protocols","pdfPath":"/iel7/6975723/6980338/06980384.pdf","startPage":"245","endPage":"256","doi":"10.1109/ICNP.2014.45","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fair Pricing in the Sky: Truthful Frequency Allocation with Dynamic Spectrum Supply","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 Oct. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Fair Pricing in the Sky: Truthful Frequency Allocation with Dynamic Spectrum Supply","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"21-24 Oct. 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6980384/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","accessionNumber":"14819651","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2014","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6980384/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fair Pricing in the Sky: Truthful Frequency Allocation with Dynamic Spectrum Supply","confLoc":"Raleigh, NC, USA","sourcePdf":"6204a245.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.105519S","chronDate":"21-24 Oct. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6975723","isNumber":"6980338","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6975723","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"6980338","articleId":"6980384","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":6980429,"authors":[{"name":"Yingya Guo","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Technology, Tsinghua University","Tsinghua National Laboratory for Information Science and Technology (TNLIST), Beijing, P.R.

Software Defined Networking (SDN) is an emerging network architecture which exerts a separation between the control plane and the data plane. The SDN controller can centrally control the network state through modifying the flow tables maintained by routers. Network operators can flexibly split arbitrary flows to outgoing links through the deployment of the SDN. However, SDN has its own challenges of full deployment, which makes the full deployment of SDN difficult in the short term. In this paper, we explore the traffic engineering in a SDN/OSPF hybrid network. In our scenario, the OSPF weights and flow splitting ratio of the SDN nodes can both be changed. The controller can arbitrarily split the flows coming into the SDN nodes. The regular nodes still run OSPF. Our contribution is that we propose a novel algorithm called SOTE that can obtain a lower maximum link utilization. We reap a greater benefit compared with the results of the OSPF network and the SDN/OSPF hybrid network with fixed weight setting. We also find that when only 30% of the SDN nodes are deployed, we can obtain a near optimal performance.","doi":"10.1109/ICNP.2014.90","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNP.2014.90","startPage":"563","endPage":"568","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 22nd International Conference on Network Protocols","pdfPath":"/iel7/6975723/6980338/06980429.pdf","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 22nd International Conference on Network Protocols","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6980338","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Traffic Engineering in SDN/OSPF Hybrid Network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 Oct. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Traffic Engineering in SDN/OSPF Hybrid Network","conferenceDate":"21-24 Oct. 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2014","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6980429/","accessionNumber":"14819608","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6980429/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Traffic Engineering in SDN/OSPF Hybrid Network","confLoc":"Raleigh, NC, USA","sourcePdf":"6204a563.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070387S","chronDate":"21-24 Oct. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6975723","isNumber":"6980338","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6975723","citationCount":"80","xplore-issue":"6980338","articleId":"6980429","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-04"},{"_id":6980437,"authors":[{"name":"Sandra Scott-Hayward","affiliation":["Centre for Secure Information Technology (CSIT), Queen's University Belfast, Belfast, N.

This introduces increased potential for innovation in networking from performance-enhanced to energy-efficient designs. In SDN, the application connects with the network via the SDN controller.

Is this information necessary for the application to execute or is it gathered for malicious intent? In this paper we present an approach to secure the northbound interface by introducing a permissions system that ensures that controller operations are available to trusted applications only.

The distributed mobile nodes establish connections to form the MANET, which may include selfish and misbehaving nodes. Recommendation based trust management has been proposed in the literature as a mechanism to filter out the misbehaving nodes while searching for a packet delivery route. However, building a trust model that adopts recommendations by other nodes in the network is a challenging problem due to the risk of dishonest recommendations like bad-mouthing, ballot-stuffing, and collusion. This paper investigates the problems related to attacks posed by misbehaving nodes while propagating recommendations in the existing trust models. We propose a recommendation based trust model with a defence scheme, which utilises clustering technique to dynamically filter out attacks related to dishonest recommendations between certain time based on number of interactions, compatibility of information and closeness between the nodes. The model is empirically tested under several mobile and disconnected topologies in which nodes experience changes in their neighbourhood leading to frequent route changes. The empirical analysis demonstrates robustness and accuracy of the trust model in a dynamic MANET environment.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Recommendation Based Trust Model with an Effective Defence Scheme for MANETs","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","doi":"10.1109/TMC.2014.2374154","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel7/7755/7229427/06980456.pdf","startPage":"2101","endPage":"2115","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMC.2014.2374154","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7229427","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6980456","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6980456/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 December 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 1 2015","displayDocTitle":"Recommendation Based Trust Model with an Effective Defence Scheme for MANETs","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"14","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/6980456/","dateOfInsertion":"28 August 2015","publicationDate":"1 Oct. 2015","accessionNumber":"15414330","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Recommendation Based Trust Model with an Effective Defence Scheme for MANETs","sourcePdf":"tmc-dahal-2374154-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.131153S","chronDate":"Oct. 1 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7755","isNumber":"7229427","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7755","citationCount":"74","xplore-issue":"7229427","articleId":"6980456","onlineDate":"09 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":6980459,"authors":[{"name":"Johannes Israel","affiliation":["Institute of Numerical Mathematics, Technische Universit\u00e4t Dresden, Dresden, Germany"],"firstName":"Johannes","lastName":"Israel","id":"37085432554"},{"name":"Andreas Fischer","affiliation":["Institute of Numerical Mathematics, Technische Universit\u00e4t Dresden, Dresden, Germany"],"firstName":"Andreas","lastName":"Fischer","id":"37345206000"},{"name":"John Martinovic","affiliation":["Institute of Numerical Mathematics, Technische Universit\u00e4t Dresden, Dresden, Germany"],"firstName":"John","lastName":"Martinovic","id":"37085441753"},{"name":"Eduard A.

With the rapid increasing number of services published on the Internet, service recommendation for automatic mashup creation gains a lot of momentum. Since mashup inherently requires services with different functions, the recommendation result should contain services from various categories. However, most existing recommendation approaches only rank all candidate services in a single list, which has two deficiencies. First, ranking services without considering to which categories they belong may lead to meaningless service ranking and affect the recommendation accuracy. Second, mashup developers are not always clear about which service categories they need and services in which categories cooperate better for mashup creation. Without explicitly recommending which service categories are relevant for mashup creation, it remains difficult for mashup developers to select proper services in a mixed ranking list, which lower the user friendliness of recommendation. To overcome these deficiencies, a novel category-aware service clustering and distributed recommending method is proposed for automatic mashup creation. First, a Kmeans variant(vKmeans) method based on topic model Latent Dirichlet Allocation is introduced for enhancing service categorization and providing a basis for recommendation. Second, on top of vKmeans, a service category relevance ranking (SCRR) model, which combines machine learning and collaborative filtering, is developed to decompose mashup requirements and explicitly predict relevant service categories. Finally, a category-aware distributed service recommendation (CDSR) model, which is based on a distributed machine learning framework, is developed for predicting service ranking order within each category. Experiments on a real-world dataset have proved that the proposed approach not only gains significant improvement at precision rate but also enhances the diversity of recommendation results.","doi":"10.1109/TSC.2014.2379251","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Services Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Services Computing","pdfPath":"/iel7/4629386/7289488/06980473.pdf","startPage":"674","endPage":"687","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSC.2014.2379251","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7289488","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Category-Aware API Clustering and Distributed Recommendation for Automatic Mashup Creation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6980473","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 December 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.-Oct. 1 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6980473/","displayDocTitle":"Category-Aware API Clustering and Distributed Recommendation for Automatic Mashup Creation","volume":"8","issue":"5","publicationDate":"1 Sept.-Oct. 2015","accessionNumber":"15539823","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6980473/","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61033005 and 61174169"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004147","fundingName":"Independent Research Fund of Tsinghua University","grantNumber":"20111080998"},{"fundingName":"Specialized Research Fund for the Doctoral Program of Higher Education","grantNumber":"20120002110034"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Category-Aware API Clustering and Distributed Recommendation for Automatic Mashup Creation","sourcePdf":"tsc-bofei-2379251-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.137958S","chronDate":"Sept.-Oct. 1 2015","xplore-pub-id":"4629386","isNumber":"7289488","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4629386","citationCount":"64","xplore-issue":"7289488","articleId":"6980473","onlineDate":"10 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6980474,"authors":[{"name":"Lu Yang","affiliation":["The University of New South Wales, School of Electrical Engineering & Telecommunications, Sydney, Australia"],"firstName":"Lu","lastName":"Yang","id":"38239524500"},{"name":"Wei Zhang","affiliation":["The University of New South Wales, School of Electrical Engineering & Telecommunications, Sydney, Australia"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37278432600"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1053-587X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0476"}],"articleNumber":"6980474","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":14,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":657},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference channels","Receivers","Array signal processing","MIMO","Transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","interference","MIMO communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["three-user MIMO interference channels","subspace alignment chain","complete DoF region","linear interference alignment scheme","spatial beamforming"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["3-user MIMO interference channel","degrees of freedom region","interference alignment"]}],"abstract":"Degrees of freedom (DoF) region of three-user interference channels is studied in this paper.

Then, a linear interference alignment scheme based on spatial beamforming is proposed that can achieve all integer DoF inside the region. As a result, the region can be seen as both the sufficient and necessary condition for the feasibility of linear interference alignment based on spatial beamforming in three-user interference channels. Moreover, the achievability of fractional DoF inside the outer bound DoF region is also addressed with the proposed beamforming scheme in combination with symbol extension.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2014.2379612","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/78/6994902/06980474.pdf","startPage":"590","endPage":"603","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2014.2379612","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6994902","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On Degrees of Freedom Region of Three-User MIMO Interference Channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6980474","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 December 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.1,  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6980474/","displayDocTitle":"On Degrees of Freedom Region of Three-User MIMO Interference Channels","volume":"63","issue":"3","publicationDate":"Feb.1, 2015","accessionNumber":"14834919","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6980474/","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Australian Research Councils Discovery Projects funding scheme","grantNumber":"DP1094194 and DP120102030"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On Degrees of Freedom Region of Three-User MIMO Interference Channels","sourcePdf":"tsp-zhang-2379612-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.032311S","chronDate":"Feb.1,  2015","isNumber":"6994902","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"14","articleId":"6980474","onlineDate":"10 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6980514,"authors":[{"name":"Tadashi Suetsugu","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering and Computer Science, Fukuoka University, Fukuoka, Japan"],"firstName":"Tadashi","lastName":"Suetsugu","id":"37266366600"},{"name":"Naoki Oyama","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering and Computer Science, Fukuoka University, Fukuoka, Japan"],"firstName":"Naoki","lastName":"Oyama","id":"37085428257"},{"name":"Shotaro Kuga","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering and Computer Science, Fukuoka University, Fukuoka, Japan"],"firstName":"Shotaro","lastName":"Kuga","id":"37085388949"},{"name":"Makoto Taromaru","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering and Computer Science, Fukuoka University, Fukuoka, Japan"],"firstName":"Makoto","lastName":"Taromaru","id":"37300843900"},{"name":"Xiuqin Wei","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering and Computer Science, Fukuoka University, Fukuoka, Japan"],"firstName":"Xiuqin","lastName":"Wei","id":"37537119400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2060-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6980514","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":126},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6980514","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Switches","Pulse width modulation","Transient analysis","Attenuation","Computer architecture","Surges","Voltage control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power amplifiers","power system restoration","power system transients","switching circuits","transmission networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ADS simulation","envelope elimination and restoration architecture","envelope pulse width modulation","EPWM-EER architecture","transient attenuation avoidance","power efficiency improvement","transient attenuation characteristics","PAPR transmission system","switching power amplifier","EER transmission system","class E amplifier"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Power Amplifier","EER","EPWM","Class E Amplifier"]}],"abstract":"The EER transmission system was introduced to exploit high efficiency switching power amplifiers in the high PAPR transmission systems such as QAM and OFDM.

EPWM architecture was introduced to improve power efficiency of the EER system by avoiding slow transient attenuation of input current of switching power amplifier. However, EPWM architecture had a problem of high peak switch voltage and low power efficiency. This paper proposes a novel EPWM-EER architecture which improves peak switch voltage and power efficiency of the conventional EPWM architecture with keeping faster transient attenuation than the conventional EER architecture.

Simulation results show that the controller that is tuned with this new PSO algorithm is superior to the traditionally tuned one in such a way that it has a smaller torque ripple and a smaller speed reference tracking error.

Once this method would be implemented in the battery management system and performed online during operation it could provide a monitoring system for the whole pack and increase its lifetime and safe operation. Current solutions are either inaccurate or too big, expensive and energy inefficient. The presented approach proposes a dual use of the battery charger which incorporates a switched mode amplifier to generate the stimuli current necessary to perform an Impedance Spectroscopy. The drawback of this method are the distortions associated with the modulation of the measurement frequency onto a carrier frequency. The influence of the DC-link voltage and the switching frequency on the on the total harmonic distortion are analysed. These theoretical results are compared with the ones from experiments. A custom designed switched amplifier was built up, specifically designed for performing Impedance Spectroscopy on a battery pack.

The typical input in real-world applications is a set of sampled data points for which a fitting curve is to be obtained. This paper addresses this problem by using Bezier curves as the approximating functions. This formulation leads to a continuous multivariate nonlinear optimization problem. Unfortunately, this is very difficult problem that cannot be solved with classical mathematical optimization techniques. In this paper, we solve the problem through a hybrid strategy combining classical methods (linear least-squares minimization), modern stochastic methods (simulated annealing) and information science metrics. For a given degree n, our method computes a near-to-optimal parameterization of data points by using simulated annealing for global search and a local search optimizer for further refinement of the global solution. Then, we compute the control points by least-squares minimization. Finally, we determine the best value for the degree of the curve by using two information science metrics that represent an adequate compromise between data-fidelity and model-complexity. Our method is applied to four illustrative examples of mathematical curves and noisy scanned data and different configurations. Our experimental results show that the method performs well for all examples.","doi":"10.1109/CW.2014.33","startPage":"182","endPage":"189","publicationTitle":"2014 International Conference on Cyberworlds","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CW.2014.33","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6980723","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 International Conference on Cyberworlds","pdfPath":"/iel7/6979352/6980723/06980760.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Simulated Annealing Algorithm for Bezier Curve Approximation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6980760/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Simulated Annealing Algorithm for Bezier Curve Approximation","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6980760/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"14827452","publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"15 December 2014","conferenceDate":"6-8 Oct. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 Oct. 2014","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Simulated Annealing Algorithm for Bezier Curve Approximation","confLoc":"Santander, Spain","sourcePdf":"4677a182.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067603S","chronDate":"6-8 Oct. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6979352","isNumber":"6980723","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6979352","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"6980723","articleId":"6980760","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":6980767,"authors":[{"name":"Wei Yang","affiliation":["University of Yamanashi"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Yang","id":"37085336062"},{"name":"Kouki Tajima","affiliation":["University of Yamanashi"],"firstName":"Kouki","lastName":"Tajima","id":"37085367705"},{"name":"Jiayi Xu","affiliation":["Hangzhou Dianzi University"],"firstName":"Jiayi","lastName":"Xu","id":"37085335234"},{"name":"Masahiro Toyoura","affiliation":["University of Yamanashi"],"firstName":"Masahiro","lastName":"Toyoura","id":"37295445100"},{"name":"Xiaoyang Mao","affiliation":["University of Yamanashi"],"firstName":"Xiaoyang","lastName":"Mao","id":"37275999300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-4677-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-4678-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6980767","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":154},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Vectors","Hair","Face","Visualization","Nose","Shape","Mouth"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer graphics","face recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["example-based automatic caricature generation system","artistic media","effective communications","expressive depiction","person prominent features","exaggeration technique","visual appearance features exaggeration","learning database","facial images","feature vectors","facial parts","hairstyle","exaggeration degree"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["caricature","example-based","exaggeration","visual appearance facial feature"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6980767","doi":"10.1109/CW.2014.40","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CW.2014.40","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6980723","publicationTitle":"2014 International Conference on Cyberworlds","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 International Conference on Cyberworlds","pdfPath":"/iel7/6979352/6980723/06980767.pdf","startPage":"237","endPage":"244","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Example-Based Automatic Caricature Generation","abstract":"Caricature is a popular artistic media widely used for effective communications. The fascination of caricature lies in its expressive depiction of a person's prominent features, which is usually realized through the so called exaggeration technique. This paper proposes a new example based automatic caricature generation system supporting the exaggeration of visual appearance features. The system comprises the construction of a learning database and the generation of caricatures. The construction of the learning database links the pairs of facial images and corresponding caricatures. Given an input face, the system automatically compute the feature vectors of facial parts and hairstyle, and search the learning database for the exaggerated parts by using the most prominent features. Experimental results show that our system can achieve the control over the degree of exaggeration and the exaggerated results can better represent the features of the subjects.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6980767/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 Oct. 2014","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"6-8 Oct. 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6980767/","dateOfInsertion":"15 December 2014","publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","accessionNumber":"14827429","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Example-Based Automatic Caricature Generation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Example-Based Automatic Caricature Generation","confLoc":"Santander, Spain","sourcePdf":"4677a237.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058801S","chronDate":"6-8 Oct. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6979352","isNumber":"6980723","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6979352","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6980723","articleId":"6980767","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":6980768,"authors":[{"name":"Mai A.

This paper presents a method used to constructing T-S fuzzy model in such case where the imprecise and uncertain output observations are represented as fuzzy belief function, and then proposes the so-called mixture data-driven T-S fuzzy model, among which, the consequents are identified by using a novel fuzzy evidential Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm and the antecedents are automatically constructed by using a data-driven strategy, considering both the accuracy and complexity of model. The performance of such mixture data data-driven fuzzy model was validated by conducting some unreliable sensor experiments.

The objective is to explain the use of down-sampling strategies as a means for reducing the number of redundant samples. It is believed the clustering to be rather generally applicable to sampling in classification applications. The hypothesis is empirically validated by examining the performance of differential evolution fuzzy classifiers on Iris and Breast Cancer Wisconsin data sets. The learning curves of the classifiers are analyzed with respect to the choice of the sampling strategies. A nearly-optimal classification performance of the classifier is achieved using a relatively small training sample, showing that population-based fuzzy modeling and classification can be successfully applied to large data sets with affordable computation.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Iris","Training","Redundancy","Computational modeling","Signal processing algorithms","Sociology","Statistics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fuzzy set theory","genetic algorithms","particle swarm optimisation","pattern classification"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sampling strategies","sample redundancy","population-based fuzzy modelling and classification","PFMC","data set quality","Iris data set","Wisconsin breast cancer data set","particle swarm optimization","PSO","genetic algorithm","GA","differential evolution","DE"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["down-sampling","population-based fuzzy modeling and classification","sample redundancy"]}],"doi":"10.1109/FSKD.2014.6980813","publicationTitle":"2014 11th International Conference on Fuzzy Systems and Knowledge Discovery (FSKD)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 11th International Conference on Fuzzy Systems and Knowledge Discovery (FSKD)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6962871/6980796/06980813.pdf","startPage":"94","endPage":"97","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6980796","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FSKD.2014.6980813","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sampling strategies and sample redundancy in population-based fuzzy modeling and classification","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6980813","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Sampling strategies and sample redundancy in population-based fuzzy modeling and classification","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6980813/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6980813/","accessionNumber":"14812113","conferenceDate":"19-21 Aug. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 Aug. 2014","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sampling strategies and sample redundancy in population-based fuzzy modeling and classification","confLoc":"Xiamen, China","sourcePdf":"a017.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040946S","chronDate":"19-21 Aug. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6962871","isNumber":"6980796","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6962871","xplore-issue":"6980796","articleId":"6980813","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6980837,"authors":[{"name":"Wei Zheng","affiliation":["College of geoexploration science and technology, Jilin University, Jilin Changchun, China"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Zheng","id":"37085501092"},{"name":"Xiuwen Mo","affiliation":["College of geoexploration science and technology, Jilin University, Jilin Changchun, China"],"firstName":"Xiuwen","lastName":"Mo","id":"37085483777"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-5148-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-5147-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6980837","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":78},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Reservoirs","Accuracy","Clustering methods","Educational institutions","Rocks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["backpropagation","fuzzy set theory","hydrocarbon reservoirs","mineral processing","neural nets","pattern clustering","production engineering computing","rocks","well logging"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["complex lithology automatic identification technology","complex mineral composition","well logging evaluation","volcaniclastic rock reservoir","lithological discrimination","fuzzy clustering method","back propagation neural network","logging data","H basin","layer-wise method","intralayer difference method","clustering analysis method"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["welllogging","lithology identification","fuzzy recognition","Back Propagation (BP) neural network"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6980837","abstract":"The complex mineral composition and special lithology cause great difficulty to well logging evaluation in volcaniclastic rock reservoir.

The results of the application show that the recognized lithology results are in good agreement with the result of core description. The coincidence rate of accuracy is more than 80%.","doi":"10.1109/FSKD.2014.6980837","startPage":"227","endPage":"231","publicationTitle":"2014 11th International Conference on Fuzzy Systems and Knowledge Discovery (FSKD)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FSKD.2014.6980837","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6980796","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 11th International Conference on Fuzzy Systems and Knowledge Discovery (FSKD)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6962871/6980796/06980837.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Complex lithology automatic identification technology based on fuzzy clustering and neural networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6980837/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Complex lithology automatic identification technology based on fuzzy clustering and neural networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6980837/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"14812092","publicationDate":"Aug. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2014","conferenceDate":"19-21 Aug. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 Aug. 2014","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Complex lithology automatic identification technology based on fuzzy clustering and neural networks","confLoc":"Xiamen, China","sourcePdf":"a041.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059949S","chronDate":"19-21 Aug. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6962871","isNumber":"6980796","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6962871","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6980796","articleId":"6980837","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6980852,"authors":[{"name":"Deqiang Chen","affiliation":["Department of Information Science and Technology, East China University of Political Science and Law, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Deqiang","lastName":"Chen","id":"37085516933"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-5148-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-5147-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6980852","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":64},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Intrusion detection","Data models","Entropy","Computers","Random variables","Educational institutions","Computational modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data analysis","entropy","moving average processes","Poisson distribution","random sequences","security of data","series (mathematics)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer anomaly detection","power series distributed random sequence","anomaly detection model distribution","moving relative entropy density deviation method","MREDD","data analysis","data comparison","negative binomial model","binomial distribution model","Poisson distribution model"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["moving average","moving relative entropy density deviation","distribution of power series","anomaly detection"]}],"abstract":"In order to quickly determine the distribution of anomaly detection model based on small amounts of collected data, the moving relative entropy density deviation method (MREDD) is introduced to test the power series distributed random sequence.

PMUs offer a more current and accurate visibility of the power grids than traditional SCADA systems. However, the high sampling rates of PMUs bring in two major challenges that need to be addressed to fully benefit from these PMU measurements. On one hand, any transient events captured in the PMU measurements can negatively impact the performance of steady state analysis. On the other hand, processing the high volumes of PMU data in a timely manner poses another challenge in computation. This paper presents PDFA, a parallel detrended fluctuation analysis approach for fast detection of transient events on massive PMU measurements utilizing a computer cluster. The performance of PDFA is evaluated from the aspects of speedup, scalability and accuracy in comparison with the standalone DFA approach.","doi":"10.1109/FSKD.2014.6980923","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FSKD.2014.6980923","startPage":"715","endPage":"719","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 11th International Conference on Fuzzy Systems and Knowledge Discovery (FSKD)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6962871/6980796/06980923.pdf","publicationTitle":"2014 11th International Conference on Fuzzy Systems and Knowledge Discovery (FSKD)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6980796","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Big data analytics on PMU measurements","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 Aug. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Big data analytics on PMU measurements","conferenceDate":"19-21 Aug. 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2014","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6980923/","accessionNumber":"14818925","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6980923/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Big data analytics on PMU measurements","confLoc":"Xiamen, China","sourcePdf":"a127.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064759S","chronDate":"19-21 Aug. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6962871","isNumber":"6980796","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6962871","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"6980796","articleId":"6980923","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6980936,"authors":[{"name":"Qicong Wang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Xiamen University, Xiamen, China"],"firstName":"Qicong","lastName":"Wang","id":"37404132300"},{"name":"Meixiang Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Xiamen University, Xiamen, China"],"firstName":"Meixiang","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37085491495"},{"name":"Yunqi Lei","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Xiamen University, Xiamen, China"],"firstName":"Yunqi","lastName":"Lei","id":"37085490260"},{"name":"Yehu Shen","affiliation":["Department of System Integration & IC Design, Suzhou Institute of Nano-Tech & Nano-Bionics, Suzhou, China"],"firstName":"Yehu","lastName":"Shen","id":"37085495344"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-5148-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-5147-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6980936","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":141},"abstract":"Sparse representation matrix is of great significance for Compressed Sensing (CS) reconstruction accuracy. Contourlet Transform (CT) offer a much richer set of directions and shapes, and it is more effective in capturing smooth contours and geometric structures in images. While dictionaries learned by machine learning methods can represent images more effectively. In this paper, we propose a multi-level adaptive dictionary learning (DL) strategy which combines both of the above advantages. We learn sub-dictionaries of high frequency of CT by an improved K-SVD algorithm, and moreover, the stopping criteria of sparse representation stage is associated with the iteratively updated dictionaries to get an adaptive sparse constraint, which gets more effective sparse representation coefficients and then improves the dictionary updating. This approach achieves a good reconstruction accuracy of the high frequency with less CS measurement. Experiment results demonstrate that the reconstructed images using dictionaries learned by the proposed algorithm in CS have better effect.","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 11th International Conference on Fuzzy Systems and Knowledge Discovery (FSKD)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6962871/6980796/06980936.pdf","startPage":"782","endPage":"787","publicationTitle":"2014 11th International Conference on Fuzzy Systems and Knowledge Discovery (FSKD)","doi":"10.1109/FSKD.2014.6980936","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FSKD.2014.6980936","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6980796","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6980936","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Image compressed sensing based on multi-level adaptive learning dictionaries","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Dictionaries","Image reconstruction","Compressed sensing","Sparse matrices","Training","Transforms","Algorithm design and analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compressed sensing","dictionaries","image capture","image reconstruction","image representation","learning (artificial intelligence)","singular value decomposition","sparse matrices"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image compressed sensing reconstruction accuracy","sparse representation matrix coefficient","CS reconstruction measurement accuracy","contourlet transform","smooth contour capturing","geometric structure capturing","machine learning method","image representation","multilevel adaptive dictionary learning strategy","multilevel adaptive DL strategy","CT high frequency subdictionary learning","improved K-SVD algorithm","iterative method","frequency reconstruction"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["compressed sensing","dictionary Learning","contourlet transform","K-SVD"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6980936/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 Aug. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Image compressed sensing based on multi-level adaptive learning dictionaries","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6980936/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2014","accessionNumber":"14812078","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2014","conferenceDate":"19-21 Aug. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Image compressed sensing based on multi-level adaptive learning dictionaries","confLoc":"Xiamen, China","sourcePdf":"a140.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.113912S","chronDate":"19-21 Aug. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6962871","isNumber":"6980796","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6962871","xplore-issue":"6980796","articleId":"6980936","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6980971,"authors":[{"name":"Fereidoon Rezaei","affiliation":["Kish international campus, Tehran University, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Fereidoon","lastName":"Rezaei","id":"37085507650"},{"name":"Masoud Khalil Nezhad","affiliation":["Dep. computer science, Kharazmi University, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Masoud Khalil","lastName":"Nezhad","id":"37085519802"},{"name":"Saeid Rezaei","affiliation":["Karaj Branch, Islamic Azad University, Karaj, Iran"],"firstName":"Saeid","lastName":"Rezaei","id":"37085503779"},{"name":"Ali Payandeh","affiliation":["Dep.

The method allows for extremely rapid querying, while still maintaining high accuracy. The dataset images that are to be queried are preprocessed by a simple binarization operation, followed by the extraction of multiple overlapping candidate targets. Each binary target, as well as the binarized query, is resized to fit a fixed-size rectangle and represented by conventional image descriptors. Then, a cosine similarity operator -- followed by maximum pooling over random groups -- is used to represent each target or query as a concise 250D vector. Retrieval is performed in a fraction of a second by nearest-neighbor search within that space, followed by a simple suppression of extra overlapping candidates.","doi":"10.1109/ICFHR.2014.9","publicationTitle":"2014 14th International Conference on Frontiers in Handwriting Recognition","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 14th International Conference on Frontiers in Handwriting Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel7/6979380/6980977/06980988.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICFHR.2014.9","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6980977","startPage":"3","endPage":"8","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Simple and Fast Word Spotting Method","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6980988","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Simple and Fast Word Spotting Method","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-4 Sept. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6980988/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"1-4 Sept. 2014","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","accessionNumber":"14827612","dateOfInsertion":"15 December 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6980988/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Simple and Fast Word Spotting Method","confLoc":"Hersonissos, Greece","sourcePdf":"4334a003.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051336S","chronDate":"1-4 Sept. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6979380","isNumber":"6980977","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6979380","citationCount":"38","xplore-issue":"6980977","articleId":"6980988","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":6980991,"authors":[{"name":"Truyen Van Phan","affiliation":["Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology, Fuchu, Tokyo, JP"],"firstName":"Truyen","lastName":"Van Phan","id":"37088540555"},{"name":"Masaki Nakagawa","affiliation":["Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Masaki","lastName":"Nakagawa","id":"37280969300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-4334-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-4335-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2167-6445"}],"articleNumber":"6980991","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":13,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":349},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Context","Accuracy","Databases","Context modeling","Feature extraction","Recurrent neural networks","Training"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["handwritten character recognition","recurrent neural nets","text analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nontext classification","online handwritten documents","recurrent neural networks","long short-term memory","LSTM network","stroke classification","digital ink document","bidirectional architecture","Japanese ink documents","Kondate database","English ink documents","IAMonDo database"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Text/Non-text classification","Text/Non-text separation","ink stroke classification","Recurrent Neural Networks","RNN","Long Short-Term Memory","LSTM"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6980991","abstract":"In this paper, we propose a novel method for text/non-text classification in online handwritten document based on Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) and its improved version, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network. The task of classifying strokes in a digital ink document into two classes (text and non-text) can be seen as a sequence labelling task. The bidirectional architecture is used in these networks to access to the complete global context of the sequence being classified. Moreover, a simple but effective model is adopted for the temporal local context of adjacent strokes. By integrating local context and global context, the classification accuracy is improved. In our experiments on the Japanese ink documents (Kondate database), the proposed method achieves a classification rate of 98.75%, which is significantly higher than the 96.61% in the previous work. Similarly, on the English ink documents (IAMonDo database), it produces a classification rate of 97.68%, which is also higher than other results reported in the literature.","doi":"10.1109/ICFHR.2014.12","startPage":"23","endPage":"28","publicationTitle":"2014 14th International Conference on Frontiers in Handwriting Recognition","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICFHR.2014.12","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6980977","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 14th International Conference on Frontiers in Handwriting Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel7/6979380/6980977/06980991.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Text/Non-text Classification in Online Handwritten Documents with Recurrent Neural Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6980991/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Text/Non-text Classification in Online Handwritten Documents with Recurrent Neural Networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6980991/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"14827653","publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"15 December 2014","conferenceDate":"1-4 Sept. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-4 Sept. 2014","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Text/Non-text Classification in Online Handwritten Documents with Recurrent Neural Networks","confLoc":"Hersonissos, Greece","sourcePdf":"4334a023.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055105S","chronDate":"1-4 Sept. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6979380","isNumber":"6980977","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6979380","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"6980977","articleId":"6980991","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6981009,"authors":[{"name":"Nan Li","affiliation":["Raytheon BBN Technologies, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Nan","lastName":"Li","id":"37085414452"},{"name":"Jinying Chen","affiliation":["Raytheon BBN Technologies, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Jinying","lastName":"Chen","id":"37716530300"},{"name":"Huaigu Cao","affiliation":["Raytheon BBN Technologies, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Huaigu","lastName":"Cao","id":"37400394900"},{"name":"Bing Zhang","affiliation":["Raytheon BBN Technologies, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Bing","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37422056400"},{"name":"Prem Natarajan","affiliation":["Information Sciences Institute, University of Southern California, Marina del Rey, California, USA"],"firstName":"Prem","lastName":"Natarajan","id":"37269307100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-4334-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-4335-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2167-6445"}],"articleNumber":"6981009","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":387},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6981009","abstract":"The recurrent neural network language model (RNNLM) is a discriminative, non-Markovian model that can capture long-span word history in natural language.

We have also developed a novel method to integrate the OCR n-best RNNLM scores into the word posterior probabilities in OCR confusion networks, which resulted in consistent observable improvements in word spotting for OCR'ed handwritten documents, as measured by both mean average precision (MAP) and detection-error tradeoff (DET) curves.","doi":"10.1109/ICFHR.2014.30","startPage":"134","endPage":"139","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 14th International Conference on Frontiers in Handwriting Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel7/6979380/6980977/06981009.pdf","publicationTitle":"2014 14th International Conference on Frontiers in Handwriting Recognition","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICFHR.2014.30","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6980977","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Applications of Recurrent Neural Network Language Model in Offline Handwriting Recognition and Word Spotting","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hidden Markov models","Optical character recognition software","Handwriting recognition","Recurrent neural networks","Training","Lattices","Character recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["document image processing","handwriting recognition","language translation","optical character recognition","recurrent neural nets","word processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["recurrent neural network language model","offline handwriting recognition","word spotting","nonMarkovian model","long-span word history","automatic speech recognition","machine translation","BBN Byblos OCR","optical character recognition system","RNNLM scores","OCR word error rate","word posterior probabilities","OCR confusion networks","OCR handwritten documents","mean average precision","MAP","detection-error tradeoff curves","DET curves"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["optical character recognition","keyword search","recurrent neural networks","information retrieval"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6981009/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-4 Sept. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Applications of Recurrent Neural Network Language Model in Offline Handwriting Recognition and Word Spotting","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6981009/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"15 December 2014","conferenceDate":"1-4 Sept. 2014","accessionNumber":"14827605","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Applications of Recurrent Neural Network Language Model in Offline Handwriting Recognition and Word Spotting","confLoc":"Hersonissos, Greece","sourcePdf":"4334a134.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.108737S","chronDate":"1-4 Sept. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6979380","isNumber":"6980977","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6979380","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6980977","articleId":"6981009","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":6981010,"authors":[{"name":"Abedelkadir Asi","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Ben-Gurion University, Beer-Sheva, Israel"],"firstName":"Abedelkadir","lastName":"Asi","id":"38484018600"},{"name":"Rafi Cohen","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Ben-Gurion University, Beer-Sheva, Israel"],"firstName":"Rafi","lastName":"Cohen","id":"38546963400"},{"name":"Klara Kedem","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Ben-Gurion University, Beer-Sheva, Israel"],"firstName":"Klara","lastName":"Kedem","id":"37284913600"},{"name":"Jihad El-Sana","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Ben-Gurion University, Beer-Sheva, Israel"],"firstName":"Jihad","lastName":"El-Sana","id":"38274901700"},{"name":"Itshak Dinstein","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Ben-Gurion University, Beer-Sheva, Israel"],"firstName":"Itshak","lastName":"Dinstein","id":"38368069200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-4334-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-4335-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2167-6445"}],"articleNumber":"6981010","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":24,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":175},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6981010","abstract":"Many applications along the manuscript analysis pipeline rely on the accuracy of pre-processing steps. Perfectly detecting the main text area in ancient historical documents is of great importance for these applications. We propose a learning-free approach to detect the main text area in ancient manuscripts. First, we coarsely segment the main text area by using a texture-based filter. Then, we refine the segmentation by formulating the problem as an energy minimization task and achieving the minimum using graph cuts. The energy function is derived from properties of the text components. Spatial coherence of the segmented text regions is explicitly encouraged by the energy function. We evaluate the suggested method on a publicly available dataset of 38 historical document images. Experiments show that the suggested approach outperforms another state-of-the-art page segmentation method in terms of segmentation quality and time performance.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image segmentation","Minimization","Equations","Mathematical model","Accuracy","Layout","Image resolution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["document image processing","graph theory","image segmentation","image texture","minimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["coarse-to-fine approach","layout analysis","ancient manuscript analysis","ancient historical document","learning-free approach","texture-based filter","segmentation","energy minimization task","graph cuts","energy function","text component","spatial coherence"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Layout Analysis","Page Segmentation","Historical Documents","Graph Cuts","Statistical Inference"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6980977","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICFHR.2014.31","startPage":"140","endPage":"145","publicationTitle":"2014 14th International Conference on Frontiers in Handwriting Recognition","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 14th International Conference on Frontiers in Handwriting Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel7/6979380/6980977/06981010.pdf","doi":"10.1109/ICFHR.2014.31","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Coarse-to-Fine Approach for Layout Analysis of Ancient Manuscripts","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Coarse-to-Fine Approach for Layout Analysis of Ancient Manuscripts","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"14827582","publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"1-4 Sept. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"15 December 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6981010/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6981010/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-4 Sept. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Coarse-to-Fine Approach for Layout Analysis of Ancient Manuscripts","confLoc":"Hersonissos, Greece","sourcePdf":"4334a140.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074246S","chronDate":"1-4 Sept. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6979380","isNumber":"6980977","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6979380","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"6980977","articleId":"6981010","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6981026,"authors":[{"name":"Cuong Tuan Nguyen","affiliation":["Department of Computer and Information Sciences, Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Cuong Tuan","lastName":"Nguyen","id":"37076369000"},{"name":"Bilan Zhu","affiliation":["Department of Computer and Information Sciences, Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Bilan","lastName":"Zhu","id":"37279330100"},{"name":"Masaki Nakagawa","affiliation":["Department of Computer and Information Sciences, Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Masaki","lastName":"Nakagawa","id":"37280969300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-4334-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-4335-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2167-6445"}],"articleNumber":"6981026","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":156},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6981026","abstract":"This paper presents a semi-incremental recognition method for online handwritten English text.

Speedups of more than 3x are achieved in training recurrent neural network models which outperform state of the art recognition results.","publicationTitle":"2014 14th International Conference on Frontiers in Handwriting Recognition","startPage":"279","endPage":"284","doi":"10.1109/ICFHR.2014.54","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICFHR.2014.54","pdfPath":"/iel7/6979380/6980977/06981033.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 14th International Conference on Frontiers in Handwriting Recognition","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6980977","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fast and Robust Training of Recurrent Neural Networks for Offline Handwriting Recognition","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6981033/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"1-4 Sept. 2014","conferenceDate":"1-4 Sept. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Fast and Robust Training of Recurrent Neural Networks for Offline Handwriting Recognition","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"15 December 2014","publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","accessionNumber":"14827536","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6981033/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast and Robust Training of Recurrent Neural Networks for Offline Handwriting Recognition","confLoc":"Hersonissos, Greece","sourcePdf":"4334a279.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050021S","chronDate":"1-4 Sept. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6979380","isNumber":"6980977","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6979380","citationCount":"83","xplore-issue":"6980977","articleId":"6981033","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6981034,"authors":[{"name":"Vu Pham","affiliation":["SUTD, Singapore"],"firstName":"Vu","lastName":"Pham","id":"37085411391"},{"name":"Th\u00e9odore Bluche","affiliation":["LIMSI CNRS, Spoken Language Processing Group, France","A2iA, Paris, France"],"firstName":"Th\u00e9odore","lastName":"Bluche","id":"37076562600"},{"name":"Christopher Kermorvant","affiliation":["A2iA, Paris, France"],"firstName":"Christopher","lastName":"Kermorvant","id":"37085415215"},{"name":"J\u00e9r\u00f4me Louradour","affiliation":["A2iA, Paris, France"],"firstName":"J\u00e9r\u00f4me","lastName":"Louradour","id":"37646695000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-4334-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-4335-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2167-6445"}],"articleNumber":"6981034","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":182,"citationCountPatent":4,"totalDownloads":1777},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hidden Markov models","Training","Handwriting recognition","Recurrent neural networks","Computer architecture","Error analysis","Databases"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["handwriting recognition","recurrent neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dropout","recurrent neural network","RNN","long short-term memory cells","unconstrained handwriting recognition","regularization method","convolutional network","recurrent connection","handwritten databases"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Recurrent Neural Networks","Dropout","Handwriting Recognition"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICFHR.2014.55","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6981034","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICFHR.2014.55","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6980977","publicationTitle":"2014 14th International Conference on Frontiers in Handwriting Recognition","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 14th International Conference on Frontiers in Handwriting Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel7/6979380/6980977/06981034.pdf","startPage":"285","endPage":"290","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dropout Improves Recurrent Neural Networks for Handwriting Recognition","abstract":"Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) with Long Short-Term memory cells currently hold the best known results in unconstrained handwriting recognition.

The relaxation convolution layer adopted in our R-CNN, unlike traditional convolutional layer, does not require neurons within a feature map to share the same convolutional kernel, endowing the neural network with more expressive power. As relaxation convolution sharply increase the total number of parameters, we adopt alternate training in ATR-CNN to regularize the neural network during training procedure.

The architecture design of our proposed hierarchical deep neural networks focuses on both \"depth\" and \"width\" of artificial neural network. Specifically for the multivariate regression, HDNN consists of multiple subnets, which is empirically more powerful than DNN. In this work, HDNN is adopted as a nonlinear feature transform to normalize the feature vector of handwritten samples with irrelevant variabilities to a target prototype. The effectiveness of proposed method is verified on a Chinese handwriting recognition task.

Our goal is to learn the distance function rather than providing an explicit one, by exploiting the specificity of the data. Several neural networks are trained to estimate the distance between two patterns, adapting the weight of the networks accordingly. For the experimental setup, we considered three well-known benchmark, publicly available data collections: MNIST digit data, Opt-digits data, and the Lampung character collection - for Arabic handwritten digits and Indonesian handwritten Lampung characters, respectively.

This is due to the high variability observed in handwritten script, the use of writing styles and script types unknown today, the frequently lacking orthographic standardization, and the degradation of the respective documents. Therefore, it is currently out of question to develop general purpose handwriting recognition systems for historical document collections. It is, however, possible to search relatively homogeneous document collections using word spotting techniques. In this paper we consider the analysis of a challenging collection of postcards from the period of World War I delivered by the German military postal service. More specifically, we consider the automatic grouping of mail pieces by spotting potentially identical addressees. As the annotation of such documents is extremely challenging even for trained experts, a manually developed ground truth annotation will, in general, not be available. Furthermore, a reliable segmentation on word level will hardly be possible. With our segmentation-free query-by-example word spotting method we investigate modifications addressing the better generalization to a multi-writer scenario and its application to degraded documents. Promising results could be achieved in this highly challenging scenario.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6980977","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICFHR.2014.85","publicationTitle":"2014 14th International Conference on Frontiers in Handwriting Recognition","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 14th International Conference on Frontiers in Handwriting Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel7/6979380/6980977/06981064.pdf","startPage":"470","endPage":"475","doi":"10.1109/ICFHR.2014.85","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Grouping Historical Postcards Using Query-by-Example Word Spotting","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-4 Sept. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Grouping Historical Postcards Using Query-by-Example Word Spotting","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"1-4 Sept. 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6981064/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","accessionNumber":"14827560","dateOfInsertion":"15 December 2014","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6981064/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Grouping Historical Postcards Using Query-by-Example Word Spotting","confLoc":"Hersonissos, Greece","sourcePdf":"4334a470.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051807S","chronDate":"1-4 Sept. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6979380","isNumber":"6980977","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6979380","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6980977","articleId":"6981064","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6981067,"authors":[{"name":"Kai Chen","affiliation":["DIVA (Document, Image and Voice Analysis) research group, University of Fribourg, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Kai","lastName":"Chen","id":"37085406543"},{"name":"Hao Wei","affiliation":["DIVA (Document, Image and Voice Analysis) research group, University of Fribourg, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Hao","lastName":"Wei","id":"37076728300"},{"name":"Jean Hennebert","affiliation":["HES-SO//FR, University of Applied Sciences, Fribourg, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Jean","lastName":"Hennebert","id":"37611404500"},{"name":"Rolf Ingold","affiliation":["DIVA (Document, Image and Voice Analysis) research group, University of Fribourg, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Rolf","lastName":"Ingold","id":"37284653800"},{"name":"Marcus Liwicki","affiliation":["DFKI, German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence","DIVA (Document, Image and Voice Analysis) research group, University of Fribourg, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Marcus","lastName":"Liwicki","id":"37670661800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-4334-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-4335-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2167-6445"}],"articleNumber":"6981067","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":27,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":306},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6981067","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image color analysis","Image segmentation","Layout","Text analysis","Histograms","Accuracy","Color"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["document image processing","feature selection","handwritten character recognition","image segmentation","image texture"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["page segmentation","historical handwritten document images","texture features","pixel labeling problem","high quality segmentation","color variance","local binary patterns","Gabor dominant orientation histogram","document image layout analysis","improved fast correlation-based filter feature selection algorithm","historical handwritten document image datasets","feature selection method","Parzival dataset"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["page segmentation","historical document","layout analysis","feature selection"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6980977","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 14th International Conference on Frontiers in Handwriting Recognition","publicationTitle":"2014 14th International Conference on Frontiers in Handwriting Recognition","doi":"10.1109/ICFHR.2014.88","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Page Segmentation for Historical Handwritten Document Images Using Color and Texture Features","startPage":"488","endPage":"493","pdfPath":"/iel7/6979380/6980977/06981067.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICFHR.2014.88","abstract":"In this paper we present a physical structure detection method for historical handwritten document images. We considered layout analysis as a pixel labeling problem. By classifying each pixel as either periphery, background, text block, or decoration, we achieve high quality segmentation without any assumption of specific topologies and shapes. Various color and texture features such as color variance, smoothness, Laplacian, Local Binary Patterns, and Gabor Dominant Orientation Histogram are used for classification. Some of these features have so far not got many attentions for document image layout analysis. By applying an Improved Fast Correlation-Based Filter feature selection algorithm, the redundant and irrelevant features are removed. Finally, the segmentation results are refined by a smoothing post-processing procedure. The proposed method is demonstrated by experiments conducted on three different historical handwritten document image datasets. Experiments show the benefit of combining various color and texture features for classification. The results also show the advantage of using a feature selection method to choose optimal feature subset. By applying the proposed method we achieve superior accuracy compared with earlier work on several datasets, e.g., We achieved 93% accuracy compared with 91% of the previous method on the Parzival dataset which contains about 100 million pixels.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6981067/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-4 Sept. 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"1-4 Sept. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"15 December 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6981067/","accessionNumber":"14827658","displayDocTitle":"Page Segmentation for Historical Handwritten Document Images Using Color and Texture Features","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Page Segmentation for Historical Handwritten Document Images Using Color and Texture Features","confLoc":"Hersonissos, Greece","sourcePdf":"4334a488.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060032S","chronDate":"1-4 Sept. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6979380","isNumber":"6980977","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6979380","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"6980977","articleId":"6981067","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6981106,"authors":[{"name":"Nikolaos Arvanitopoulos","affiliation":["School of Computer and Communication Sciences (IC), \u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne (EPFL), Switzerland"],"firstName":"Nikolaos","lastName":"Arvanitopoulos","id":"38193880400"},{"name":"Sabine S\u00fcsstrunk","affiliation":["School of Computer and Communication Sciences (IC), \u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne (EPFL), Switzerland"],"firstName":"Sabine","lastName":"S\u00fcsstrunk","id":"37271567600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-4334-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-4335-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2167-6445"}],"articleNumber":"6981106","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":34,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":277},"abstract":"We propose a novel algorithm for automatic text line extraction on color and gray scale manuscript pages without prior binarization.

Among the different ways of performing multiplication, Montgomery multiplication introduced by Peter Montgomery is the widely used algorithm. Despite improvements in the clock frequency and the level of parallelism of conventional microprocessors, software-based implementation of Montgomery multiplication remains insufficient in terms of both performance and energy efficiency. This has led to research investigating more efficient hardware accelerators. There are several techniques enhance the performance of Montgomery multiplier. The adaptive LMS filter is widely used in digital signal processing and communication. Adaptive filter has great application in noise cancellation. In this paper, we have the survey of various methods for hardware implementation of Montgomery multiplier and an efficient Montgomery multiplier is select for implementation in Adaptive LMS filter. The simulation results of realization adaptive LMS filters on a single FPGA chip is reported and the performances of Adaptive LMS filter with Montgomery multiplier is compare with normal Adaptive FIR filter. The LMS algorithm is less complex and suitable for hardware implementation. The digital adaptive LMS FIR filters were modeled by VHDL. The Xilinx software is used for synthesize and simulation of VHDL codes. Especially area and speed are the parameters taken into consideration. The time for Montgomery multiplication needs 4.75\u03bcm under the clock frequency of 113.09 MHz.","doi":"10.1109/INPAC.2014.6981137","publicationTitle":"2014 International Conference on Power, Automation and Communication (INPAC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 International Conference on Power, Automation and Communication (INPAC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6965113/6981124/06981137.pdf","startPage":"66","endPage":"70","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6981124","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INPAC.2014.6981137","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FPGA implementation of an efficient montgomery multiplier for adaptive filtering application","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6981137/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 Oct. 2014","displayDocTitle":"FPGA implementation of an efficient montgomery multiplier for adaptive filtering application","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6981137/","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2014","publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","accessionNumber":"14819151","conferenceDate":"6-8 Oct. 2014","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FPGA implementation of an efficient montgomery multiplier for adaptive filtering application","confLoc":"Amravati, India","sourcePdf":"Minpac2014submission57.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.086327S","chronDate":"6-8 Oct. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6965113","isNumber":"6981124","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6965113","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6981124","articleId":"6981137","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6981140,"authors":[{"name":"Shubhangi Kale","affiliation":["Electronics and Telecommunication Dept., Trinity college of engineering & Research, Pune, India"],"firstName":"Shubhangi","lastName":"Kale","id":"37085342375"},{"name":"R.

Through the investigation of the design process, the study is able to give perspective on the achievable performance from Class J at the X-band, thereby promoting further study on efficient broadband communications at high RF and microwave frequencies.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Harmonic analysis","Power amplifiers","Power generation","Impedance","Gallium nitride","HEMTs","Bandwidth"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high electron mobility transistors","power amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["X-band class J power amplifiers","microwave operating frequencies","HEMT","end-to-end design process","third harmonic control","load harmonic filtering","design process","microwave frequencies","broadband communications","design goal","power 6 W","frequency 9.2 GHz to 10.8 GHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Class J","X-band","power amplifiers","broadband amplifiers"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ISWTA.2014.6981171","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE Symposium on Wireless Technology and Applications (ISWTA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE Symposium on Wireless Technology and Applications (ISWTA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6968868/6981155/06981171.pdf","startPage":"13","endPage":"18","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6981155","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISWTA.2014.6981171","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design considerations for X-band Class J power amplifiers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6981171","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Design considerations for X-band Class J power amplifiers","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6981171/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6981171/","accessionNumber":"14819384","conferenceDate":"28 Sept.-1 Oct. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 28 2014-Oct. 1 2014","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design considerations for X-band Class J power amplifiers","confLoc":"Kota Kinabalu, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"p13purisima.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064316S","chronDate":"Sept. 28 2014-Oct. 1 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6968868","isNumber":"6981155","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6968868","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6981155","articleId":"6981171","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6981176,"authors":[{"name":"Norun Abdul Malek","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, International Islamic University Malaysia, Selangor, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Norun Abdul","lastName":"Malek","id":"37601905000"},{"name":"Rob Seager","affiliation":["School of Electronic, Electrical and Software Engineering, Loughborough University, Loughborough, United Kingdom"],"firstName":"Rob","lastName":"Seager","id":"37303147800"},{"name":"James Flint","affiliation":["School of Electronic, Electrical and Software Engineering, Loughborough University, Loughborough, United Kingdom"],"firstName":"James","lastName":"Flint","id":"37283541700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-5436-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-5435-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2324-7843"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2324-7851"}],"articleNumber":"6981176","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":296},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Genetic algorithms","Arrays","Beam steering","Dipole antennas","Optimization","Sociology","Statistics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna phased arrays","beam steering","dipole antenna arrays","electromagnetic coupling","genetic algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["beam steering","four dipoles antenna array","genetic algorithm","2D array","array analysis","induced EMF method","azimuth direction","MATLAB software","mutual coupling","pattern multiplication method","phased array antenna"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["beam steering","pattern synthesis","antenna array","optimisation","genetic algorithm"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6981176","abstract":"This paper demonstrates the capability of four dipoles antenna (two-dimensional array) to steer the beam to arbitrary direction.

In this paper we present a novel localization scheme based on the Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) Radar concepts. The proposed scheme aims to locate the ground moving transmitting sources in the environments where LOS is not available. The scheme locates the signal reflecting nodes present in such environments by jointly estimating the Angle of Departure (AOD) and Angle of Arrival (AOA) of the multipath signals. This information is then used to accurately determine the mobile source location by following geometrical approach. The localization of mobile transmitter in the proposed scheme is carried out without any additional intermediate reference sources. This gives the scheme advantage and supremacy over existing schemes in terms of simplicity, cost and performance.","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE Symposium on Wireless Technology and

Traditionally, in digital modulation, random noise is modeled as an additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN). In this paper, a novel coding scheme is introduced by which the effect of AWGN is decreased and the bit error rate (BER) versus the signal to noise ratio (SNR) curves are enhanced for quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) schemes such as 16, 64 and 256 QAM. This satisfies the growing need of high data rates with minimum receiving error. The proposed scheme depends on using the variational Bayesian expectation maximization (VBEM) algorithm and mapping of weights. It is performed on the symbol level not on the bit level. The paper shows comparisons between the proposed VBEM coding algorithm and the Viterbi algorithm. The proposed algorithm has better BER performance as well as extra coding gain when compared to the Viterbi algorithm with same code rates.","doi":"10.1109/ISWTA.2014.6981195","publicationTitle":"2014

optimization in distributed beamforming using multiobjective and metaheuristic method","abstract":"Distributed beamforming is a communication method in wireless sensor networks (WSNs) where the sensor nodes collaboratively create a virtual antenna to direct their radiating power towards the direction of an intended destination. This method could increase the transmission range of the network and save the sensors' energy. However, due to the random locations of the sensor nodes, the beampattern for a finite number of nodes usually has asymmetrical sidelobes with high sidelobe levels. Higher sidelobe levels cause undesirable interferences at directions other than the intended destination. Conventional sidelobe reduction methods proposed for centralized antenna array cannot be used for distributed beamforming networks. This paper proposes a distributed network compliant, multi-objective weight optimization technique to produce a beampattern with lower sidelobe levels, higher directivity and minimal energy. Exhaustive search for the most favorable weight solutions is time-consuming when the number of sensor nodes is large. Therefore, this paper analyses the use of nature-inspired metaheuristic algorithms to solve for the best weight values at each sensor node. Three algorithms were analysed, namely, genetic algorithm (GA), particle swarm optimization (PSO) and gravitational search algorithm (GSA). Simulation results show that the proposed multi-objective weight optimization using nature inspired algorithm can provide improved beampattern with lower sidelobes, higher directivity and better energy savings.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 28 2014-Oct. 1 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6981202/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"14819372","publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","conferenceDate":"28 Sept.-1 Oct. 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6981202/","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Beampatten optimization in distributed beamforming using multiobjective and metaheuristic method","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Beampatten optimization in distributed beamforming using multiobjective and metaheuristic method","confLoc":"Kota Kinabalu, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"p86jayaprakasam.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066015S","chronDate":"Sept. 28 2014-Oct. 1 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6968868","isNumber":"6981155","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6968868","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"6981155","articleId":"6981202","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6981273,"authors":[{"name":"Leonardo Vera","affiliation":["Electronics Research Laboratory/DIMES, Delft University of Technology, The Netherlands"],"firstName":"Leonardo","lastName":"Vera","id":"38467213000"},{"name":"John R.

The comparison is made in the same technology node and under similar design conditions (bias current, supply voltage, class of operation and silicon area). Moreover, slow wave coplanar waveguides (S-CPW) were used for matching network in order to reduce the impact of the passive components on the overall performances. Measurement results prove the superiority of bipolar PA in terms of power gain (8.2 dB against 5.5 dB for MOS), and power added efficiency (PAE) (16 % against 12 % for MOS).

Therefore, this paper proposes an adaptive passive fault tolerant control method for actuator faults of affine class of MIMO nonlinear systems with uncertainties using sliding mode control. The actuator fault is represented by a multiplicative factor of the control signal which reflects the loss of actuator effectiveness. The design of the controller is based on the assumption that the maximum loss level of the actuator effectiveness is known. Further, since the proposed controller is adaptive, it does not require any a priori knowledge of the uncertainty bounds. The closed loop stability conditions of the controller are derived based on Lyapunov theory. The effectiveness of the proposed controller is demonstrated considering an example of a two degree of freedom helicopter and has been found to be satisfactory.","doi":"10.1109/CCA.2014.6981489","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE Conference on Control Applications (CCA)","startPage":"1184","endPage":"1189","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCA.2014.6981489","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6981319","pdfPath":"/iel7/6960121/6981319/06981489.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE Conference on Control Applications (CCA)","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Actuators","Uncertainty","Manifolds","MIMO","Fault tolerance","Fault tolerant systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["actuators","adaptive control","closed loop systems","control system synthesis","fault tolerant control","Lyapunov methods","MIMO systems","nonlinear control systems","stability","uncertain systems","variable structure systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO nonlinear systems","adaptive passive fault tolerant control method","sliding mode control","multiplicative factor","control signal","controller design","maximum actuator effectiveness loss level","uncertainty bounds","closed loop stability conditions","Lyapunov theory","two-degree-of-freedom helicopter","affine class actuator faults"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MIMO","Non-linear","Sliding Mode Control","Adaptive","Uncertainties","Actuator Fault","Passive Fault Tolerant Control","Two DOF helicopter"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Passive actuator fault tolerant control for a class of MIMO non-linear systems with uncertainties","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6981489/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6981489/","accessionNumber":"14818791","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2014","publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","conferenceDate":"8-10 Oct. 2014","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Oct. 2014","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Passive actuator fault tolerant control for a class of MIMO non-linear systems with uncertainties","confLoc":"Juan Les Antibes, France","sourcePdf":"0014.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045886S","chronDate":"8-10 Oct. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6960121","isNumber":"6981319","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6960121","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6981319","articleId":"6981489","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6981502,"authors":[{"name":"Kiyotaka Shimizu","affiliation":["Faculty of Science and Technology, Keio University, Kohoku-ku, Yokohama, Japan"],"firstName":"Kiyotaka","lastName":"Shimizu","id":"37085498274"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7409-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1085-1992"}],"articleNumber":"6981502","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":52},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Output feedback","MIMO","Closed loop systems","Stability analysis","Delays","PD control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["asymptotic stability","closed loop systems","delays","feedback","linear matrix inequalities","linear systems","Lyapunov methods","MIMO systems","three-term control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["P\u00b7SPR\u00b7D+I control","set-point servo problem","linear MIMO time-delay systems","asymptotic stability analysis","Lyapunov direct method","LMI technique","high-gain output feedback theorem","minimum phase","control-input time-delay system","P\u00b7SPR\u00b7D controller parameters","closed-loop system","zero dynamics"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["P\u00b7SPR\u00b7D+I control","time-delay system","high gain output feedback","LMI","stabilization"]}],"abstract":"This paper is concerned with set-point servo problem of linear time-delay systems.

This paper presents a data-driven proportional-integral-derivative (DD-PID) controller design method that uses a large database. In this method, a large data-set comprising input/output (I/O) data and control parameters is stored in a database in advance, and current control parameters are tuned by using the database in an online manner. The DD-PID controller design method utilizes the fictitious reference iterative tuning (FRIT) approach to learn control parameters in the database in an offline manner by utilizing initial experimental I/O data. This method is called the DD-FRIT method. In the study, the DD-FRIT method was applied to a nonlinear tank system to evaluate its effectiveness. This paper is structured as follows. First, the DD-PID controller design method is presented. Next, the offline learning algorithm that combines the design method with FRIT is explained. Finally, the results of a simulation and experiment are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. These results showed that control parameters in the database were learned appropriately by the proposed method, and good control results were obtained.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Tuning","Indexes","Iterative methods","PD control","Vectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["control system synthesis","learning systems","nonlinear control systems","three-term control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["database utilization","data-driven proportional-integral-derivative controller design method","I-O data","input-output data","control parameters","DD-PID controller design method","fictitious reference iterative tuning approach","FRIT approach","nonlinear tank system","offline learning algorithm"]}],"doi":"10.1109/CCA.2014.6981527","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE Conference on Control Applications (CCA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE Conference on Control Applications (CCA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6960121/6981319/06981527.pdf","startPage":"1443","endPage":"1448","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6981319","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCA.2014.6981527","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design and application of a data-driven PID controller","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6981527","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Design and application of a data-driven PID controller","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6981527/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6981527/","accessionNumber":"14818741","conferenceDate":"8-10 Oct. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Oct. 2014","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design and application of a data-driven PID controller","confLoc":"Juan Les Antibes, France","sourcePdf":"0245.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.080231S","chronDate":"8-10 Oct. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6960121","isNumber":"6981319","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6960121","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6981319","articleId":"6981527","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6981533,"authors":[{"name":"Ruben Cubo","affiliation":["Department of Information Technology, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden"],"firstName":"Ruben","lastName":"Cubo","id":"37085445735"},{"name":"Alexander Medvedev","affiliation":["Department of Information Technology, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden"],"firstName":"Alexander","lastName":"Medvedev","id":"37283234600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7409-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1085-1992"}],"articleNumber":"6981533","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":107},"abstract":"Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) is a widely established treatment for Parkinson's Disease where electrical pulsatile stimulation is delivered to a target area in the brain by means of an implanted electrode. To understand better how the stimuli propagate through the brain of the patient, mathematical models of various levels of sophistication have been developed using Finite Element Methods (FEM). However, the accuracy of these models, aiming mostly at stimuli tuning in and individualization of DBS systems, is still unclear. One complication is posed by the interface between the encapsulation tissue surrounding the electrode lead and the bulk brain tissue. It is usually modelled as a discontinuity in the electric conductivity, which translates into a discontinuity of the first derivative of the electric potential. The goal of this study is to analyze the accuracy of the solution yielded by the FEM tool using different interface models between the two media, comparing it to the one predicted in the literature. The obtained results suggest that, although a discontinuous conductivity will not introduce any extra numerical inaccuracies, exchanging the interface with a discontinuous conductivity for a smooth transition might yield more accurate model solutions.","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE Conference on Control Applications (CCA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6960121/6981319/06981533.pdf","startPage":"1479","endPage":"1484","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE Conference on Control Applications (CCA)","doi":"10.1109/CCA.2014.6981533","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCA.2014.6981533","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6981319","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6981533","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Accuracy of the Finite Element Method in Deep Brain Stimulation modelling","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Conductivity","Logistics","Finite element analysis","Brain models","Mathematical model","Satellite broadcasting"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bioelectric potentials","biological tissues","biomedical electrodes","brain","diseases","electrical conductivity","finite element analysis","patient treatment","prosthetics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["interface models","FEM","electric potential","electric conductivity","encapsulation tissue","DBS systems","mathematical models","implanted electrode","electrical pulsatile stimulation","Parkinson disease treatment","deep brain stimulation modelling","finite element method"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6981533/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Oct. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Accuracy of the Finite Element Method in Deep Brain Stimulation modelling","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6981533/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","accessionNumber":"14818781","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2014","conferenceDate":"8-10 Oct. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Accuracy of the Finite Element Method in Deep Brain Stimulation modelling","confLoc":"Juan Les Antibes, France","sourcePdf":"0345.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05472S","chronDate":"8-10 Oct. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6960121","isNumber":"6981319","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6960121","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6981319","articleId":"6981533","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6981535,"authors":[{"name":"Hesham W.

From a mechanical point of view, it means it is possible to modify the natural frequencies and the damping of a n-DoF system, letting modal shapes unchanged. Independent modal control can be profitably used in active vibration control increasing the damping of the system without changing its natural frequencies and vibration modes. A control of this type can improve the dynamic performance, reduce the vibratory phenomenon (and the resulting acoustic noise) and increase the fatigue strength of the system. This work demonstrates how the performance of the control depends on the number and position of sensors and actuators used besides, obviously, on the reduced model used to synthesize the control itself. The position of both sensors and actuators is optimized through genetic algorithm to reduce spillover effects due to unmodeled modes. Theoretical aspects are supported by numerical simulations.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6981587/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Oct. 2014","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"8-10 Oct. 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6981587/","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2014","publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","accessionNumber":"14811987","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A genetic algorithm optimization for IMSC technique","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A genetic algorithm optimization for IMSC technique","confLoc":"Juan Les Antibes, France","sourcePdf":"0365.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.088664S","chronDate":"8-10 Oct. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6960121","isNumber":"6981319","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6960121","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6981319","articleId":"6981587","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6981630,"authors":[{"name":"Peng Li","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory on Integrated Optoelectronics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Peng","lastName":"Li","id":"37085452905"},{"name":"Ming Liu","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory on Integrated Optoelectronics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Ming","lastName":"Liu","id":"37085453894"},{"name":"Xu Zhang","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory on Integrated Optoelectronics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xu","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37085467159"},{"name":"Hongda Chen","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory on Integrated Optoelectronics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Hongda","lastName":"Chen","id":"37085472375"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2346-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2163-4025"}],"articleNumber":"6981630","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":381},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6981630","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Feature extraction","Principal component analysis","Support vector machine classification","Multiplexing","Sorting"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","feature extraction","field programmable gate arrays","medical signal detection","microelectrodes","neurophysiology","principal component analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["online feature extraction algorithm","spike sorting","multichannel FPGA-based neural recording systems","Dual Vertex Threshold","DVT","Minimum Delimitation","MD","spike detection","feature vector extraction","computational complexity","multichannel FPGA hardware architecture","sorting performance","K-means","PCA-based feature","transmission bandwidth","original data rate"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Feature extraction","FPGA","low complexity","high efficiency"]}],"abstract":"A novel feature extraction algorithm for multichannel FPGA-based neural recording systems is presented in this paper.

Incurred by high signal frequency and large channel numbers, the acquisition rate could be on the order of hundred MB/s, which requires compression before wireless transmission.

To improve the performance while reducing the number of measurements, we propose a multi-modal structured dictionary learning algorithm that enforces both group sparsity and joint sparsity to learn sparsifying dictionaries for all channels simultaneously. When the data is compressed 50 times, our method can achieve a gain of 4 dB and 10 percentage units over state-of-art approaches in terms of the reconstruction quality and classification accuracy, respectively.","doi":"10.1109/BioCAS.2014.6981632","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE Biomedical Circuits and Systems Conference (BioCAS) Proceedings","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE Biomedical Circuits and Systems Conference (BioCAS) Proceedings","pdfPath":"/iel7/6968677/6981625/06981632.pdf","startPage":"9","endPage":"12","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BioCAS.2014.6981632","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6981625","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A dictionary learning algorithm for multi-channel neural recordings","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6981632","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 Oct. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6981632/","displayDocTitle":"A dictionary learning algorithm for multi-channel neural recordings","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","accessionNumber":"14812276","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6981632/","conferenceDate":"22-24 Oct. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A dictionary learning algorithm for multi-channel neural recordings","confLoc":"Lausanne, Switzerland","sourcePdf":"1036.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055461S","chronDate":"22-24 Oct. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6968677","isNumber":"6981625","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6968677","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"6981625","articleId":"6981632","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":6981633,"authors":[{"name":"Mahsa Shoaran","affiliation":["Microelectronic Systems Laboratory, Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (EPFL)"],"firstName":"Mahsa","lastName":"Shoaran","id":"38511392500"},{"name":"Hossein Afshari","affiliation":["Microelectronic Systems Laboratory, Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (EPFL)"],"firstName":"Hossein","lastName":"Afshari","id":"37299268400"},{"name":"Alexandre Schmid","affiliation":["Microelectronic Systems Laboratory, Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (EPFL)"],"firstName":"Alexandre","lastName":"Schmid","id":"37085336120"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2346-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2163-4025"}],"articleNumber":"6981633","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":382},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Topology","Time division multiplexing","Power demand","Arrays","Signal to noise ratio","Compressed sensing","Capacitors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bioelectric potentials","biomedical electrodes","CMOS integrated circuits","compressed sensing","medical signal detection","medical signal processing","neural nets","silicon","telemedicine"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compressive sensing architecture","high-density biological signal recording","dense electrode arrays","Nyquist-sampling signal conditioning blocks","implantable biological signal acquisition","wireless biological signal acquisition","implantable multichannel neural recording systems","silicon","sixteen-channel spatial-domain compressive recording system","UMC CMOS technology","size 0.18 mum","Si"]}],"abstract":"The massive amount of data recorded by dense electrode arrays which are routinely connected to Nyquist-sampling signal conditioning blocks introduces new design challenges for implantable and wireless biological signal acquisition.

Our proposed technique, applied on 9 healthy subjects instructed to sleep in 13 different postures, resulted in 98.4% classification accuracy in distinguishing three main stable sleeping postures.

Gray-level image information is acquired pixel-individually and event-driven at a temporal resolution equivalent to thousands of frames-per-second while the data rate is kept at a fraction of the rate encountered with conventional high-speed cameras by means of near ideal pixel-level redundancy suppression. The presented ATIS camera combines three consecutive exposure estimation / measurement steps that apply different trade-offs between measurement speed, accuracy and noise. Early estimates of pixel values deliver between 10 and 100 times faster updates than the eventual full-swing integrating exposure measurement that reaches 1 kFPS equivalent temporal resolution at sunny outdoor conditions. In addition, a miniaturized ATIS camera is demonstrated that constitutes one of the first (if not the first) neuromorphic device designed specifically for application in a commercial medical product.","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6981677","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE Biomedical Circuits and Systems Conference (BioCAS) Proceedings","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE Biomedical Circuits and Systems Conference (BioCAS) Proceedings","pdfPath":"/iel7/6968677/6981625/06981677.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6981625","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BioCAS.2014.6981677","startPage":"174","endPage":"174","doi":"10.1109/BioCAS.2014.6981677","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6981677/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 Oct. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Live demonstration: Event-driven high-speed imaging","isDynamicHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2014","conferenceDate":"22-24 Oct. 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6981677/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","accessionNumber":"14812259","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Live demonstration: Event-driven high-speed imaging","confLoc":"Lausanne, Switzerland","sourcePdf":"1291.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.108661S","chronDate":"22-24 Oct. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6968677","isNumber":"6981625","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6968677","xplore-issue":"6981625","articleId":"6981677","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6981686,"authors":[{"name":"L.

Current state of the art transfers the whole sEMG signal but encounter problems when this signal has to be transferred wirelessly in real-time. To overcome limitations of the current state of the art we propose compressed sensing (CS) as a technique to reduce the size of sEMG data. This work demonstrates the advantage of using a priori knowledge on the sEMG signal by rakeness-based design of a CS acquisition system. Our CS system was shaped on the general purpose data from Physionet and tested on data acquired for a simple hand movement recognition task. Results show that it is possible to significantly reduce the size of transmitted sEMG data while being able to reconstruct good quality signals and recognize hand movemenents.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Compressed sensing based on rakeness for surface ElectroMyoGraphy","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE Biomedical Circuits and Systems Conference (BioCAS) Proceedings","doi":"10.1109/BioCAS.2014.6981698","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE Biomedical Circuits and Systems Conference (BioCAS) Proceedings","pdfPath":"/iel7/6968677/6981625/06981698.pdf","startPage":"204","endPage":"207","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BioCAS.2014.6981698","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6981625","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6981698","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6981698/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 Oct. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Compressed sensing based on rakeness for surface ElectroMyoGraphy","conferenceDate":"22-24 Oct. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6981698/","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2014","publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","accessionNumber":"14812285","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Compressed sensing based on rakeness for surface ElectroMyoGraphy","confLoc":"Lausanne, Switzerland","sourcePdf":"1165.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.085287S","chronDate":"22-24 Oct. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6968677","isNumber":"6981625","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6968677","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6981625","articleId":"6981698","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":6981704,"authors":[{"name":"Pascal Alexander Hager","affiliation":["Integrated Systems Laboratory, ETH Zurich, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Pascal Alexander","lastName":"Hager","id":"37085455975"},{"name":"Pirmin Vogel","affiliation":["Integrated Systems Laboratory, ETH Zurich, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Pirmin","lastName":"Vogel","id":"37085505160"},{"name":"Andrea Bartolini","affiliation":["Electrical, Electronic, and Information Engineering, University of Bologna, Italy","Integrated Systems Laboratory, ETH Zurich, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Andrea","lastName":"Bartolini","id":"37883004300"},{"name":"Luca Benini","affiliation":["Eidgenossische Technische Hochschule Zurich, Zurich, ZH, CH"],"firstName":"Luca","lastName":"Benini"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2346-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2163-4025"}],"articleNumber":"6981704","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":222},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Array signal processing","Imaging","Ultrasonic imaging","Transducers","Delays","Computer architecture","Three-dimensional displays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomedical ultrasonics","medical image processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS technology","temporal correlation","delay approximation circuit","memory bandwidth","high image quality","high-resolution 3D medical ultrasound imaging","high-frame-rate 3D medical ultrasound imaging","large-scale 3D-ultrasound beamformer","integrated fully-digital 3D-ultrasound beamformer","size 130 nm"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Assessing the area/power/performance tradeoffs for an integrated fully-digital, large-scale 3D-ultrasound beamformer","doi":"10.1109/BioCAS.2014.6981704","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6981625","endPage":"231","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE Biomedical Circuits and Systems Conference (BioCAS) Proceedings","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE Biomedical Circuits and Systems Conference (BioCAS) Proceedings","pdfPath":"/iel7/6968677/6981625/06981704.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BioCAS.2014.6981704","startPage":"228","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6981704","abstract":"High-frame-rate and high-resolution 3D medical ultrasound imaging imposes high requirements on the involved processing hardware. Several thousands of analog signals need to be processed in many steps to obtain a final image. Fully digital beamforming makes it possible to achieve high image quality coupled with extreme flexibility. Unfortunately, digital beamforming imposes staggering requirements on main memory bandwidth caused by the loading of off-chip stored beamforming delays. In this paper we present the first fully-digital integrated beamformer that is able to compute 269.3 M focal points (FP) per second from 10 000 receive channels, and which does not require off-chip main memory. This is enabled by our novel delay approximation circuit that exploits temporal correlation between subsequent computations and thereby allows to compute the delays for beamforming online. To estimate the area and power requirements, the complete system was designed and the beamformer core was evaluated for a 130 nm CMOS technology. The estimated complexity per channel is 37.2 kGE and the corresponding power dissipation was estimated with 48 mW.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6981704/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 Oct. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2014","accessionNumber":"14819242","htmlLink":"/document/6981704/","conferenceDate":"22-24 Oct. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Assessing the area/power/performance tradeoffs for an integrated fully-digital, large-scale 3D-ultrasound beamformer","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Assessing the area/power/performance tradeoffs for an integrated fully-digital, large-scale 3D-ultrasound beamformer","confLoc":"Lausanne, Switzerland","sourcePdf":"1022.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069475S","chronDate":"22-24 Oct. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6968677","isNumber":"6981625","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6968677","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6981625","articleId":"6981704","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6981710,"authors":[{"name":"Kiyotaka Sasagawa","affiliation":["Graduate School of Materials Science, Nara Institute of Science and Technology, Ikoma, Nara, Japan"],"firstName":"Kiyotaka","lastName":"Sasagawa","id":"37287324600"},{"name":"Takahiro Yamaguchi","affiliation":["Graduate School of Materials Science, Nara Institute of Science and Technology, Ikoma, Nara, Japan"],"firstName":"Takahiro","lastName":"Yamaguchi","id":"37085457733"},{"name":"Makito Haruta","affiliation":["Graduate School of Materials Science, Nara Institute of Science and Technology, Ikoma, Nara, Japan"],"firstName":"Makito","lastName":"Haruta","id":"38246962800"},{"name":"Yoshinori Sunaga","affiliation":["Graduate School of Materials Science, Nara Institute of Science and Technology, Ikoma, Nara, Japan"],"firstName":"Yoshinori","lastName":"Sunaga","id":"37074151900"},{"name":"Hironari Takehara","affiliation":["Graduate School of Materials Science, Nara Institute of Science and Technology, Ikoma, Nara, Japan"],"firstName":"Hironari","lastName":"Takehara","id":"37074521600"},{"name":"Toshihiko Noda","affiliation":["Graduate School of Materials Science, Nara Institute of Science and Technology, Ikoma, Nara, Japan"],"firstName":"Toshihiko","lastName":"Noda","id":"37401924800"},{"name":"Takashi Tokuda","affiliation":["Graduate School of Materials Science, Nara Institute of Science and Technology, Ikoma, Nara, Japan"],"firstName":"Takashi","lastName":"Tokuda","id":"37085474071"},{"name":"Jun Ohta","affiliation":["Graduate School of Materials Science, Nara Institute of Science and Technology, Ikoma, Nara, Japan"],"firstName":"Jun","lastName":"Ohta","id":"38225940000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2346-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2163-4025"}],"articleNumber":"6981710","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":78},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6981710","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image sensors","PSNR","Lighting","Blood","Brain"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomedical optical imaging","brain","fluorescence","haemodynamics","image sensors","prosthetics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["brain imaging","implantable image sensor","signal-to-noise ratio","bioimaging","fluorescence","incident light intensity","self-reset function","SNR","blood flow imaging","rat brain surface"]}],"doi":"10.1109/BioCAS.2014.6981710","endPage":"255","startPage":"252","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE Biomedical Circuits and Systems Conference (BioCAS) Proceedings","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE Biomedical Circuits and Systems Conference (BioCAS) Proceedings","pdfPath":"/iel7/6968677/6981625/06981710.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BioCAS.2014.6981710","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6981625","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An implantable image sensor with self-reset function for brain imaging","abstract":"We designed and fabricated an implantable image sensor high peak signal-to-noise ratio (SNR).

Unlike current solutions for ECG monitoring with autonomous wireless sensors, we propose an asynchronous method to transmit data from an ECG front-end, which is designed with a 2-bit level-crossing analog-to-digital converter. The output bits (UD and Change) of the ADC are first combined using a pulse encoder circuit and then transmitted via a backscattering link in the 402-MHz MICS frequency band. The pulse encoder comprises an inverter delay chain controlled by signal UD, thereby setting the duration of the data pulse. The encoder is enabled only when the ADC has digitized the ECG signal, thus reducing the system's overall power consumption. The complete IC is designed in a standard 0.18m CMOS process. Simulation results show that the ECG readout plus pulse encoder consumes 9.1\u03bcW for 45k data conversions per second.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6981625","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BioCAS.2014.6981748","doi":"10.1109/BioCAS.2014.6981748","startPage":"404","endPage":"407","pdfPath":"/iel7/6968677/6981625/06981748.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE Biomedical Circuits and Systems Conference (BioCAS) Proceedings","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE Biomedical Circuits and Systems Conference (BioCAS) Proceedings","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6981748","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 Oct. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6981748/","displayDocTitle":"An asynchronous event-driven data transmitter for wireless ECG sensor nodes","conferenceDate":"22-24 Oct. 2014","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"14819179","publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6981748/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An asynchronous event-driven data transmitter for wireless ECG sensor nodes","confLoc":"Lausanne, Switzerland","sourcePdf":"1117.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048914S","chronDate":"22-24 Oct. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6968677","isNumber":"6981625","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6968677","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6981625","articleId":"6981748","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6981750,"authors":[{"name":"S.

As single-stranded DNA translocates through a nanopore, each nucleotide induces a blockage in the ionic channel, creating a unique current signature. However, the fast translocation speed and small current changes, which are superimposed on a much larger baseline current, pose significant technical challenges on the measurement circuitry. Furthermore, the rapid change in the baseline current that occurs during translocation necessitates the step response of the measurement circuitry be minimized. Here we present a hybrid semi-digital transimpedance amplifier to sense these minute current signatures while discharging the baseline current using a semidigital feedback loop. The amplifier achieves fast settling by adaptively altering the bandwidth of the feedback loop when a step input is detected. Measurement results show the performance of the amplifier with 100 M\u03a9 DC gain, 560 kHz flat-gain bandwidth, and 5 fA/\u221aHz input-referred current noise. The fast settling response is demonstrated by observing the insertion of a protein nanopore in a lipid bilayer.","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE Biomedical Circuits and Systems Conference (BioCAS) Proceedings","pdfPath":"/iel7/6968677/6981625/06981760.pdf","startPage":"452","endPage":"455","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE Biomedical Circuits and Systems Conference (BioCAS) Proceedings","doi":"10.1109/BioCAS.2014.6981760","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BioCAS.2014.6981760","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6981625","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6981760","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A hybrid semi-digital transimpedance amplifier for nanopore-based DNA sequencing","keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bioelectric phenomena","biological techniques","biomembrane transport","DNA","lipid bilayers","nanobiotechnology","nanoporous materials","operational amplifiers","proteins"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hybrid semidigital transimpedance amplifier","nanopore-based DNA sequencing","next generation deoxyribonucleic acid sequencing","single-stranded DNA","nucleotide","blockage","ionic channel","unique current signature","fast translocation speed","small current changes","baseline current","measurement circuitry","step response","minute current signatures","semidigital feedback loop","feedback loop bandwidth","step input","amplifier performance","flat-gain bandwidth","input-referred current noise","fast settling response","protein nanopore","lipid bilayer","resistance 100 Mohm","frequency 560 kHz","current 5 fA"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["DNA Sequencing","Nanopore","Transimpedance Amplifier","Semi-Digital Feedback Loop","Adaptive Filter"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6981760/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 Oct. 2014","displayDocTitle":"A hybrid semi-digital transimpedance amplifier for nanopore-based DNA sequencing","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6981760/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","accessionNumber":"14812222","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2014","conferenceDate":"22-24 Oct. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A hybrid semi-digital transimpedance amplifier for nanopore-based DNA sequencing","confLoc":"Lausanne, Switzerland","sourcePdf":"1048.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.109369S","chronDate":"22-24 Oct. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6968677","isNumber":"6981625","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6968677","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6981625","articleId":"6981760","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":6981768,"authors":[{"name":"Rituraj Singh","affiliation":["InSilixa Inc., Sunnyvale, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Rituraj","lastName":"Singh","id":"37954476900"},{"name":"Arun Manickam","affiliation":["InSilixa Inc., Sunnyvale, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Arun","lastName":"Manickam","id":"37600853100"},{"name":"Arjang Hassibi","affiliation":["InSilixa Inc., Sunnyvale, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Arjang","lastName":"Hassibi","id":"37295059600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2346-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2163-4025"}],"articleNumber":"6981768","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":335},"abstract":"High-throughput and highly multiplexed DNA detection platforms require complex and generally bulky instrumentation to perform sensing, signal conditioning and quantification.

neuromorphic VLSI","abstract":"The lamprey has been often used as a model for understanding the role of Central Pattern Generators (CPGs) in locomotion. Many artificial neural network models have been proposed in the past to explain the neuro-physiology and behavioral data measured from the lamprey, and several robotic implementations have been built to test the software models in a real physical bio-mimetic artifact, and to reproduce the characteristic locomotion patterns observed in the real lamprey. However, in these systems there has typically been a clear separation between the mechanical component of the system (the body), and its control part (the CPG), typically implemented with conventional digital platforms, such as micro-controllers or Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs). Here we propose to implement a CPG network using neuromorphic electronic circuits, that can be directly interfaced to the robotic actuators of a bio-mimetic robotic lamprey, eliminating the distinction between software and hardware. These circuits comprise low-power analog silicon neurons and synapses, that are affected by device mismatch and noise. The challenge is therefore to determine the CPG model that can best implement robust locomotion control of the bio-mimetic artifact, in face of the constraints imposed by the neuromorphic implementation. As these constraints are similar to the ones faced by the neurons and synapses in the real lamprey (e.g., finite and small power consumption, finite and small resolution or signal to noise ratio, large variability, etc.), the final system implementation will shed light onto the neural processing principles used by real CPG networks to produce robust and distributed control of locomotion in a physical bio-mimetic artifact.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6981775/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 Oct. 2014","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"22-24 Oct. 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6981775/","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2014","publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","accessionNumber":"14812279","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A spiking implementation of the lamprey's Central Pattern Generator in neuromorphic VLSI","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A spiking implementation of the lamprey's Central Pattern Generator in neuromorphic VLSI","confLoc":"Lausanne, Switzerland","sourcePdf":"1035.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054539S","chronDate":"22-24 Oct. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6968677","isNumber":"6981625","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6968677","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"6981625","articleId":"6981775","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6981776,"authors":[{"name":"L.

It has been implemented on computers using high-level programming languages. However the software model runs much slower than real time, and therefore is not capable of performing for applications that need real-time control, such as interactive robotic systems. Here we present a compact neural core for digital implementation of the NEF on Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) in real time. The proposed digital neural core consists of 64 neurons that are instantiated by a single physical neuron using a time-multiplexing approach. As NEF intrinsically uses a spike rate-encoding paradigm, rather than implementing spiking neurons and then measuring their firing rates, we chose to implement NEF with neurons that compute their firing rate directly. The neuron is efficiently implemented using a 9-bit fixed-point multiplier without the requirement of memory, the bandwidth of memory being the bottleneck for the time-multiplexing approach. The neural core uses only a fraction of the hardware resources in a commercial-off-the-shelf FPGA (even an entry level one) and can be easily programmed for different mathematical computations. Multiple cores can easily be combined to build real-time large-scale cognitive neural networks using the Neural Engineering Framework.","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE Biomedical Circuits and Systems Conference (BioCAS) Proceedings","pdfPath":"/iel7/6968677/6981625/06981784.pdf","startPage":"548","endPage":"551","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE Biomedical Circuits and Systems Conference (BioCAS) Proceedings","doi":"10.1109/BioCAS.2014.6981784","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BioCAS.2014.6981784","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6981625","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6981784","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A compact neural core for digital implementation of the Neural Engineering Framework","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neurons","Real-time systems","Field programmable gate arrays","Firing","Biological neural networks","Tuning","Decoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bioelectric potentials","brain models","cellular biophysics","cognition","field programmable gate arrays","multiplexing","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural engineering framework","brain model","high-level programming languages","software model","interactive robotic systems","field programmable gate arrays","digital neural core","time-multiplexing approach","spike rate-encoding paradigm","neuron firing rate computation","nine-bit fixed-point multiplier","memory bandwidth","mathematical computations","real-time large-scale cognitive neural networks"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6981784/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 Oct. 2014","displayDocTitle":"A compact neural core for digital implementation of the Neural Engineering Framework","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6981784/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","accessionNumber":"14812192","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2014","conferenceDate":"22-24 Oct. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A compact neural core for digital implementation of the Neural Engineering Framework","confLoc":"Lausanne, Switzerland","sourcePdf":"1162.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.081116S","chronDate":"22-24 Oct. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6968677","isNumber":"6981625","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6968677","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6981625","articleId":"6981784","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6981792,"authors":[{"name":"Tianyi Liu","affiliation":["Institute of Microelectronics, University of Ulm"],"firstName":"Tianyi","lastName":"Liu","id":"38467763800"},{"name":"Ulrich Bihr","affiliation":["Institute of Microelectronics, University of Ulm"],"firstName":"Ulrich","lastName":"Bihr","id":"38468744200"},{"name":"Joachim Becker","affiliation":["Institute of Microelectronics, University of Ulm"],"firstName":"Joachim","lastName":"Becker","id":"37270020600"},{"name":"Jens Anders","affiliation":["Institute of Microelectronics, University of Ulm"],"firstName":"Jens","lastName":"Anders","id":"37568332100"},{"name":"Maurits Ortmanns","affiliation":["Institute of Microelectronics, University of Ulm"],"firstName":"Maurits","lastName":"Ortmanns","id":"37270110800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2346-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2163-4025"}],"articleNumber":"6981792","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":17,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":282},"abstract":"We report on an optical telemetric link capable of providing a high data rate at a low power consumption for the transcutaneous transmission of neural signals. The telemetric link is designed for operation as the interface between an implanted cortical array and an external receiver. By converting the digitized neural signals to a stream of infrared optical pulses, the optical telemetry wirelessly transmits the neural data through the skin. The implantable transmitter prototype PCB contains a VCSEL (Vertical Cavity Surface Emitting Laser) driver with a VCSEL glued onto its chip surface. For protection, the transmitter PCB is coated with a thin layer of PDMS. The external receiver utilizes a large-size PIN silicon photodiode followed by a shunt shunt feedback transimpedance amplifier, a limiting amplifier and circuitry for clock and data recovery. In vivo tests performed on an anesthetized sheep show that the link is capable of transmitting data at a speed of 100 Mbps with a bit error rate (BER) of 2\u00d7 10\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">-7</sup>\n while consuming only 2.1 mW of electrical power.","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE Biomedical Circuits and Systems Conference (BioCAS) Proceedings","pdfPath":"/iel7/6968677/6981625/06981792.pdf","startPage":"580","endPage":"583","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE Biomedical Circuits and Systems Conference (BioCAS) Proceedings","doi":"10.1109/BioCAS.2014.6981792","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BioCAS.2014.6981792","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6981625","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6981792","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"In vivo verification of a 100 Mbps transcutaneous optical telemetric link","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optical transmitters","Optical receivers","Optical fiber communication","Vertical cavity surface emitting lasers","Photodiodes","Telemetry"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomedical equipment","biomedical telemetry","laser applications in medicine","neurophysiology","operational amplifiers","optical links","optical receivers","optical transmitters","p-i-n photodiodes","prosthetics","skin","surface emitting lasers","telemedicine"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["in vivo verification","transcutaneous optical telemetric link","high data rate","power consumption","transcutaneous transmission","implanted cortical array","external receiver","digitized neural signals","infrared optical pulses","optical telemetry wireless transmits","neural data","skin","implantable transmitter prototype PCB","VCSEL","vertical cavity surface emitting laser","VCSEL driver","PIN silicon photodiode","shunt shunt feedback transimpedance amplifier","limiting amplifier","data recovery","anesthetized sheep","transmitting data","bit error rate","BER","electrical power"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6981792/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 Oct. 2014","displayDocTitle":"In vivo verification of a 100 Mbps transcutaneous optical telemetric link","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6981792/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","accessionNumber":"14812270","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2014","conferenceDate":"22-24 Oct. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"In vivo verification of a 100 Mbps transcutaneous optical telemetric link","confLoc":"Lausanne, Switzerland","sourcePdf":"1137.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060643S","chronDate":"22-24 Oct. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6968677","isNumber":"6981625","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6968677","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"6981625","articleId":"6981792","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6981795,"authors":[{"name":"Aditi Chemparathy","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Toronto, Canada"],"firstName":"Aditi","lastName":"Chemparathy","id":"37085426871"},{"name":"Hossein Kassiri","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Toronto, Canada"],"firstName":"Hossein","lastName":"Kassiri","id":"37085416412"},{"name":"M.

The backup circuit can achieve 2-clock-cycle data backup and 4-clock-cycle data restore; thus, the processor system can efficiently perform temporally fine-grained power gating and can achieve longer standby times.

the original OFDM as a result of the continuous connection with higher-order derivatives between the OFDM symbols. Compared with the other sidelobe suppression schemes, for example, cancellation carrier insertion, and windowing, N-continuous OFDM does not require an extended guard interval nor the insertion of a wide guard band or cancellation carriers. However, N-continuous OFDM requires an iterative algorithm to remove the correction symbols from received symbols at the receiver and the large power of the correction symbols in the high-frequency area results in unavailable bandwidth. Here, we propose an extension of the N-continuous OFDM precoder matrix that flattens the bias power caused by the correction symbols in all frequency areas. Numerical experiments show that the proposed method improves the error rate performance without degrading the sidelobe suppression performance. The proposed method can also reduce the unavailable bandwidth.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Extension of --Continuous OFDM Precoder Matrix for Improving Error Rate","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","doi":"10.1109/LCOMM.2014.2379643","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/4234/7033064/06981928.pdf","startPage":"283","endPage":"286","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCOMM.2014.2379643","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7033064","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6981928","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6981928/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 December 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2015","displayDocTitle":"Extension of <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\"TeX\">$N$</tex-math></inline-formula>-Continuous OFDM Precoder Matrix for Improving Error Rate","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"19","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/6981928/","dateOfInsertion":"06 February 2015","publicationDate":"Feb. 2015","accessionNumber":"14914522","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Extension of <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\"TeX\">$N$</tex-math></inline-formula>-Continuous OFDM Precoder Matrix for Improving Error Rate","sourcePdf":"lcomm-ohta-2379643-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.045034S","chronDate":"Feb.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"4234","isNumber":"7033064","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4234","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7033064","articleId":"6981928","onlineDate":"10 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6981933,"authors":[{"name":"Chuan Ma","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/7010064/6981933/ma-2379633_print-small.gif","p":["\nChuan Ma received the B.E. degree in communication engineering from\nSichuan University, China, in 2009 and the M.E. degree in information and communication engineering from Zhejiang\nUniversity, China, in 2012.

In D2D-enabled cellular networks, interference generated by D2D communications is usually viewed as an obstacle to cellular communications. However, in this paper, we present a new perspective on the role of D2D interference by taking security issues into consideration. We consider a large-scale D2D-enabled cellular network with eavesdroppers overhearing cellular communications. Using stochastic geometry, we model such a network and analyze the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) distributions, connection probabilities and secrecy probabilities of both the cellular and D2D links. We propose two criteria for guaranteeing performances of secure cellular communications, namely the strong and weak performance guarantee criteria. Based on the obtained analytical results of link characteristics, we design optimal D2D link scheduling schemes under these two criteria respectively.

To speed up layout design time for a new design, analog layout designers prefer referring to legacy designs and layouts rather than starting from scratch, or thoroughly applying placement and routing tools because legacy layouts contain pretty much design expertise. Motivated by such layout design process, this paper presents the first knowledge-based physical synthesis methodology to generate new layouts by integrating existent design expertise. The proposed approach can automatically analyze legacy design data including circuits, layouts, and constraints, extract matched sub-circuits between new and legacy designs, and generate multiple layouts for the new design by utilizing the quality-approved legacy layouts as much as possible. Experimental results show that the proposed methodology can achieve high layout reusage rate, and hence the designers' layout preference can be successfully reserved.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6981934/","volume":"34","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/6981934/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2015","accessionNumber":"14854519","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"16 January 2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 December 2014","displayDocTitle":"A Novel Analog Physical Synthesis Methodology Integrating Existent Design Expertise","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003711","fundingName":"Ministry of Science and Technology of Taiwan","grantNumber":"NSC 102-2220-E-194-006, 102-2221-E-194-065-MY2 and NSC 103-2917-I-006-086"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel Analog Physical Synthesis Methodology Integrating Existent Design Expertise","sourcePdf":"tcad-lin-2379630-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.15044S","chronDate":"Feb.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"43","isNumber":"7012128","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"7012128","articleId":"6981934","onlineDate":"10 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6981937,"authors":[{"name":"Haibin Yan","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6221036/7297778/6981937/yan-2376934-small.gif","p":["Haibin Yan received the B.Eng. and M.Eng. degrees from the Xi\u2019an University of Technology, Xi\u2019an, China, and the Ph.D. degree from the National University of Singapore, Singapore, in 2004, 2007, and 2013, all in mechanical engineering.","She is currently a Research Fellow with the Department of Mechanical Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore.

Unlike most previous kinship verification methods which employ low-level hand-crafted descriptors such as local binary pattern and Gabor features for face representation, this paper aims to learn discriminative mid-level features to better characterize the kin relation of face images for kinship verification. To achieve this, we construct a set of face samples with unlabeled kin relation from the labeled face in the wild dataset as the reference set. Then, each sample in the training face kinship dataset is represented as a mid-level feature vector, where each entry is the corresponding decision value from one support vector machine hyperplane. Subsequently, we formulate an optimization function by minimizing the intraclass samples (with a kin relation) and maximizing the neighboring interclass samples (without a kin relation) with the mid-level features. To better use multiple low-level features for mid-level feature learning, we further propose a multiview PDFL method to learn multiple mid-level features to improve the verification performance. Experimental results on four publicly available kinship datasets show the superior performance of the proposed methods over both the state-of-the-art kinship verification methods and human ability in our kinship verification task.","doi":"10.1109/TCYB.2014.2376934","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel7/6221036/7297778/06981937.pdf","startPage":"2535","endPage":"2545","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCYB.2014.2376934","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7297778","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Prototype-Based Discriminative Feature Learning for Kinship Verification","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6981937","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 December 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6981937/","displayDocTitle":"Prototype-Based Discriminative Feature Learning for Kinship Verification","volume":"45","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 2015","accessionNumber":"15520754","pubMedId":"25532145","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6981937/","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Human Cyber Security Systems Program at the Advanced Digital Sciences Center from the Agency for Science, Technology and Research of Singapore"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61373090 and 61402062"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Prototype-Based Discriminative Feature Learning for Kinship Verification","sourcePdf":"tcyb-lu-2376934-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.107668S","chronDate":"Nov.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"6221036","isNumber":"7297778","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6221036","citationCount":"94","xplore-issue":"7297778","articleId":"6981937","onlineDate":"10 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6981938,"authors":[{"name":"Adrien F.

However, the switching delay of their core components-the magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs)-is a stochastic quantity. To account for this in electronic design, only partial models (working in extreme regimes) are available. In this paper, we propose an analytical model for the stochastic switching delay of a current-driven MTJ, with in-plane magnetization, that agrees with physical simulations, from low- to high-current regimes through intermediate regime. We performed physical macrospin simulations of MTJs for a wide range of current. We developed an analytical model for the mean switching delay that fits those simulations results, and smoothly connects well-accepted models for the extreme low and extreme high currents limits. In addition, a probability distribution in agreement with our simulations results is proposed, leading to a full model of the stochastic switching delay. An example for the application of the model is proposed. Our analytical model can help to evaluate the error rate in MRAM designs, and allow designing innovative electronic circuits that exploit the intrinsic stochastic behavior of MTJs as a beneficial feature.","doi":"10.1109/TED.2014.2372475","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel7/16/6994894/06981938.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TED.2014.2372475","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6994894","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","startPage":"164","endPage":"170","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 December 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Analytical Macrospin Modeling of the Stochastic Switching Time of Spin-Transfer Torque Devices","volume":"62","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/6981938/","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2014","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"14834714","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6981938/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2015","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001665","fundingName":"Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR) COGNISPIN Project","grantNumber":"ANR-13-JS03-0004-01"},{"fundingName":"European Union within the FP7 Programme through the ICT BAMBI Project","grantNumber":"FP7-ICT-2013-C"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analytical Macrospin Modeling of the Stochastic Switching Time of Spin-Transfer Torque Devices","sourcePdf":"ted-vincent-2372475-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.085538S","chronDate":"Jan.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"16","isNumber":"6994894","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"54","xplore-issue":"6994894","articleId":"6981938","onlineDate":"10 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6981940,"authors":[{"name":"Fanghong Guo","affiliation":["Energy Research Institute at NTU (ERI@N), Interdisciplinary Graduate School, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/7109198/6981940/guo-2379211-small.gif","p":["\nFanghong Guo received the B.Eng. degree in automation\nscience from Southeast University, Nanjing, China, in 2010 and the M.Eng. degree in automation science and electrical\nengineering from Beihang University, Beijing, China, in 2013.

A distributed finite-time control approach is used in the voltage restoration which enables the voltages at all the distributed generations (DGs) to converge to the reference value in finite time, and thus, the voltage and frequency control design can be separated. Then, a consensus-based distributed frequency control is proposed for frequency restoration, subject to certain control input constraints. Our control strategies are implemented on the local DGs, and thus, no central controller is required in contrast to existing control schemes proposed so far. By allowing these controllers to communicate with their neighboring controllers, the proposed control strategy can restore both voltage and frequency to their respective reference values while having accurate real power sharing, under a sufficient local stability condition established. An islanded MG test system consisting of four DGs is built in MATLAB to illustrate our design approach, and the results validate our proposed control strategy.","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2014.2379211","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/41/7109198/06981940.pdf","startPage":"4355","endPage":"4364","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7109198","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2014.2379211","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed Secondary Voltage and Frequency Restoration Control of Droop-Controlled Inverter-Based Microgrids","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6981940","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2015","displayDocTitle":"Distributed Secondary Voltage and Frequency Restoration Control of Droop-Controlled Inverter-Based Microgrids","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6981940/","publicationDate":"July 2015","dateOfInsertion":"15 May 2015","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"15142407","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6981940/","volume":"62","issue":"7","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 December 2014","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Major State Basic Research Development Program 973","grantNumber":"2012CB215202"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61134001"},{"fundingName":"Singapore's National Research Foundation","grantNumber":"NRF-CRP8-2011-03"},{"fundingName":"Energy Research Institute"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed Secondary Voltage and Frequency Restoration Control of Droop-Controlled Inverter-Based Microgrids","sourcePdf":"tie-song-2379211-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.096885S","chronDate":"July  2015","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"7109198","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"374","xplore-issue":"7109198","articleId":"6981940","onlineDate":"10 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":6981947,"authors":[{"name":"Jeffrey D.

In this process, different users may follow different decision making strategies, some are compensatory in which only an overall value on all the criteria is evaluated, some evaluate one criterion at a time in the order of their importance levels, while others count on the number of winning criteria. Most of the current QoS-based service selection systems do not consider these decision strategies in the ranking process, which we believe are crucial for generating accurate ranking results for individual users. In this paper, we propose a decision strategy based service ranking model. Furthermore, considering that different users follow different strategies in different contexts at different times, we apply a machine learning algorithm to learn a personalized ranking model for individual users based on how they select services in the past. We have implemented and tested the proposed approach, and our experiment results show the effectiveness of the approach.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6981951/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.-Oct. 1 2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 December 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6981951/","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","publicationDate":"1 Sept.-Oct. 2015","accessionNumber":"15539824","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"8","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Personalized Decision-Strategy based Web Service Selection using a Learning-to-Rank Algorithm","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000038","fundingName":"Natural Science and Engineering Research Council of Canada","grantNumber":"299021-2010"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Personalized Decision-Strategy based Web Service Selection using a Learning-to-Rank Algorithm","sourcePdf":"tsc-ding-2377724-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.100143S","chronDate":"Sept.-Oct. 1 2015","xplore-pub-id":"4629386","isNumber":"7289488","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4629386","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"7289488","articleId":"6981951","onlineDate":"10 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-29"},{"_id":6981957,"authors":[{"name":"Feiran Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/7081396/6981957/wang-2379653-small.gif","p":["\nFeiran Wang received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from \nPeking University in 2013.

The converter performs an independent self-adapting input power tracking process for each source. The peak power conversion efficiency measured during single-source operation is 89.6%. With all sources enabled, the intrinsic current consumption is as low as 47.9 nA/source. A self-starting battery-less architecture has been implemented in a 0.32-\u03bcm STMicroelectronics BCD technology with a 2142 \u03bcm \u00d7 2142 \u03bcm die area. The IC only requires a single-shared inductor and an external storage capacitor for the basic working configuration. With respect to other multisource energy harvesters, this design specifically introduces a series of nanopower design techniques for extreme minimization of the intrinsic consumption during operation. The small chip size combined with the limited number of required external component, the high conversion efficiency, and the state-of-the-art intrinsic nanocurrent consumption make the IC suitable for many critical applications with very limited available power, such as wearable devices or unobtrusive wireless sensor networks.","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2014.2379622","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2014.2379622","startPage":"5665","endPage":"5680","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/63/7112252/06981962.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7112252","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Nanocurrent Power Management IC for Multiple Heterogeneous Energy Harvesting Sources","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6981962/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 December 2014","displayDocTitle":"A Nanocurrent Power Management IC for Multiple Heterogeneous Energy Harvesting Sources","volume":"30","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"22 May 2015","accessionNumber":"15144598","publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","htmlLink":"/document/6981962/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"European Community"},{"fundingName":"NIAC Nanoelectronics Framework Programme","grantNumber":"ENIAC-2012-2"},{"fundingName":"Italian Ministry of Instruction, Research and University"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Nanocurrent Power Management IC for Multiple Heterogeneous Energy Harvesting Sources","sourcePdf":"tpel-dini-2379622-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.174452S","chronDate":"Oct.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"7112252","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"56","xplore-issue":"7112252","articleId":"6981962","onlineDate":"10 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6981964,"authors":[{"name":"Xianghui Cao","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, IL, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/7081396/6981964/cao-2379642-small.gif","p":["\nXianghui Cao (S'08\u2013M'11) received the B.S. and Ph.D. degrees in \ncontrol science and engineering from Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China, in 2006 and 2011, respectively.

In this paper, we investigate the problem of energy-efficient spectrum sensing for remotely estimating the state of a general linear dynamic system, and formulate an optimization problem which minimizes the total sensor energy consumption while guaranteeing a desired level of estimation performance. We model the problem as a mixed integer nonlinear program and propose a simulated annealing based optimization algorithm which jointly addresses when to perform sensing, which channels to sense, in what order and how long to scan each channel. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm well balances the sensing energy and transmission energy expenditure and can achieve the desired estimation performance.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6981964/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 December 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"14","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2015","dateOfInsertion":"07 April 2015","accessionNumber":"15039152","htmlLink":"/document/6981964/","displayDocTitle":"Energy-Efficient Spectrum Sensing for Cognitive Radio Enabled Remote State Estimation Over Wireless Channels","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"CNS-1053777, CNS-1320736 and SES-1343380"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61203036"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy-Efficient Spectrum Sensing for Cognitive Radio Enabled Remote State Estimation Over Wireless Channels","sourcePdf":"twc-cao-2379642-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.175516S","chronDate":"April  2015","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"7081396","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"7081396","articleId":"6981964","onlineDate":"10 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6981966,"authors":[{"name":"Mario Goldenbaum","affiliation":["Communications and Information Theory Chair, Technische Universit\u00e1t M\u00fcnchen, Munich, Germany"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/7081396/6981966/golde-2380317-small.gif","p":["\nMario Goldenbaum (S'09) received the Dipl.-Ing.

The objective of the network is not to reconstruct individual sensor readings at designated fusion centers but rather to reliably compute some functions thereof. Our particular attention is on real-valued functions that can be represented as a post-processed sum of pre-processed sensor readings. Such functions are called nomographic functions and their special structure permits the utilization of the interference property of the Gaussian multiple-access channel to reliably compute many linear and nonlinear functions at significantly higher rates than those achievable with standard schemes that combat interference. Motivated by this observation, a computation scheme is proposed that combines a suitable data pre- and post-processing strategy with a nested lattice code designed to protect the sum of pre-processed sensor readings against the channel noise. After analyzing its computation rate performance, it is shown that at the cost of a reduced rate, the scheme can be extended to compute every continuous function of the sensor readings in a finite succession of steps, where in each step a different nomographic function is computed. This demonstrates the fundamental role of nomographic representations.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/7081396/06981966.pdf","startPage":"2093","endPage":"2105","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2014.2380317","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2014.2380317","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7081396","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6981966","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Nomographic Functions: Efficient Computation in Clustered Gaussian Sensor Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Reliability","Lattices","Wireless sensor networks","Wireless communication","Decoding","Interference","Accuracy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Gaussian channels","nonlinear functions","radiofrequency interference","sensor fusion","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nomographic functions","clustered Gaussian sensor networks","clustered wireless sensor network","Gaussian multipleaccess channels","fusion centers","preprocessed sensor readings","lattice code design","channel noise"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["In-network computation","nomographic functions","Kolmogorov\u2019s superpositions","nested lattice codes","multipleaccess channel","wireless sensor networks"]},{"kwd":["In-network computation","nomographic functions","Kolmogorov's superpositions","nested lattice codes","multiple-access channel","wireless sensor networks"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6981966/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 December 2014","displayDocTitle":"Nomographic Functions: Efficient Computation in Clustered Gaussian Sensor Networks","volume":"14","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/6981966/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2015","accessionNumber":"15039128","dateOfInsertion":"07 April 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy (BMWi)","grantNumber":"01MA13008B"},{"fundingName":"German Research Foundation (DFG)","grantNumber":"STA 864/3-2"},{"fundingName":"DFG","grantNumber":"Bo 1734/20-1"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Nomographic Functions: Efficient Computation in Clustered Gaussian Sensor Networks","sourcePdf":"twc-goldenbaum-2380317-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.099719S","chronDate":"April  2015","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"7081396","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"7081396","articleId":"6981966","onlineDate":"10 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6981967,"authors":[{"name":"Chu-Hsiang Huang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/7010064/6981967/huang-2379663-small.gif","p":["\nChu-Hsiang Huang received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electrical\nengineering from National Taiwan University, R.O.C., in 2007 and 2009, respectively.

In this paper, we investigate the performance of a popular statistical inference algorithm, belief propagation (BP) on probabilistic graphical models, implemented on noisy hardware, and we propose two robust implementations of the BP algorithm targeting different computation noise distributions. We assume that the BP messages are subject to zero-mean transient additive computation noise. We focus on graphical models satisfying the contraction mapping condition that guarantees the convergence of the noise-free BP. We first upper bound the distances between the noisy BP messages and the fixed point of (noise-free) BP as a function of the iteration number. Next, we propose two implementations of BP, namely, censoring BP and averaging BP, that are robust to computation noise. Censoring BP rejects incorrect computations to keep the algorithm on the right track to convergence, while averaging BP takes the average of the messages in all iterations up to date to mitigate the effects of computation noise. Censoring BP works effectively when, with high probability, the computation noise is exactly zero, and averaging BP, although having a slightly larger overhead, works effectively for general zero-mean computation noise distributions. Sufficient conditions on the convergence of censoring BP and averaging BP are derived. Simulations on the Ising model demonstrate that the two proposed implementations successfully converge to the fixed point achieved by noise-free BP. Additionally, we apply averaging BP to a BP-based image denoising algorithm and as a BP decoder for LDPC codes. In the image denoising application, averaging BP successfully denoises an image even when nominal BP fails to do so in the presence of computation noise. In the BP LDPC decoder application, the power of averaging BP is manifested by the reduction in the residual error rates compared with the nominal BP decoder.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2014.2379663","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2014.2379663","startPage":"11","endPage":"24","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/7010064/06981967.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7010064","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Belief Propagation Algorithms on Noisy Hardware","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6981967/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 December 2014","displayDocTitle":"Belief Propagation Algorithms on Noisy Hardware","volume":"63","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"14 January 2015","accessionNumber":"14851091","publicationDate":"Jan. 2015","htmlLink":"/document/6981967/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000083","fundingName":"Directorate for Computer and Information Science and Engineering","grantNumber":"1029030"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Belief Propagation Algorithms on Noisy Hardware","sourcePdf":"tcomm-dolecek-2379663-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.149833S","chronDate":"Jan.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"7010064","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"7010064","articleId":"6981967","onlineDate":"10 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6981976,"authors":[{"name":"Mingfu Li","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, College of Engineering, Chang Gung University, Tao-Yuan, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/7109198/6981976/li-2379586-small.gif","p":["\n\nMingfu Li received the B.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan, in 1991 and 1998, respectively.","From 1998 to 2003, he worked as an Associate Researcher in the Telecommunication Laboratories at Chunghwa Telecom Company, Ltd., Tao-Yuan, Taiwan, where he investigated related techniques on time and frequency synchronization.

The goals are to reduce the impact of wireless interference on a smart home control network and unnecessary energy consumption of a smart home. An isolated WSN with one coordinator, which is integrated into the PLC transceiver, is established in each room. The coordinator is responsible for transferring environmental parameters obtained by WSNs to the management station via PLCs. The control messages for home appliances are directly transferred using PLCs rather than WSNs. According to the experimental results, the impact of wireless interference on the proposed smart home control network is substantially mitigated. Additionally, a smart control algorithm for lighting systems and an analysis of the illumination of a fluorescent lamp were presented. The energy saving of lighting systems relative to those without smart control was evaluated. Numerical results indicate that the electricity consumption on a sunny or cloudy day can be reduced by at least 40% under the smart control. Moreover, a prototype for the proposed smart home control network with the smart control algorithm was implemented. Experimental tests demonstrate that the proposed system for smart home control networks is practically feasible and performs well.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2014.2379586","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7109198","startPage":"4430","endPage":"4442","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/41/7109198/06981976.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design and Implementation of Smart Home Control Systems Based on Wireless Sensor Networks and Power Line Communications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6981976/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 December 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6981976/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Design and Implementation of Smart Home Control Systems Based on Wireless Sensor Networks and Power Line Communications","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2015","accessionNumber":"15142402","dateOfInsertion":"15 May 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"62","issue":"7","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004663","fundingName":"Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan","grantNumber":"NSC100-2221-E-182-068 and NSC102-2221-E-182-002-MY2"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design and Implementation of Smart Home Control Systems Based on Wireless Sensor Networks and Power Line Communications","sourcePdf":"tie-li-2379586-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.080489S","chronDate":"July  2015","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"7109198","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"161","xplore-issue":"7109198","articleId":"6981976","onlineDate":"10 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6981985,"authors":[{"name":"Wesam Rohouma","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Zawia, Libya"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/7055987/6981985/rohou-2379585-small.gif","p":["\nWesam Rohouma received the B.Sc. degree in electrical \nengineering from the University of Zawia, Zawia, Libya, in 1997, the M.Sc. degree in engineering project managements \nfrom the University of Tripoli, Tripoli, Libya, in 2004, and the Ph.D. degree in power electronics from The University \nof Nottingham, Nottingham, U.K., in 2013.","Since June 2013, he has been a Lecturer of electrical and electronic engineering with the University of Zawia, where \nhe is also currently a member of the Strategic Planning Unit and the Dean of the Faculty of Engineering.

In this paper, we focus on observations that are related to a general non-linear model. The proposed framework is valid as long as the observations are independent, and its likelihood satisfies the regularity conditions. We use several functions of the Cram\u00e9r-Rao bound (CRB) as a performance measure. We formulate the sensor selection problem as the design of a sparse vector, which in its original form is a nonconvex \u2113\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">0</sub>\n-(quasi) norm optimization problem. We present relaxed sensor selection solvers that can be efficiently solved in polynomial time. The proposed solvers result in sparse sensing techniques. We also propose a projected subgradient algorithm that is attractive for large-scale problems.

It uses real-time information monitored from selective representative areas to develop network templates. The three stages are: clustering, classification and scaling. It can be used to identify the loading conditions of unmonitored LV systems with similar fixed data to those monitored LV substations. In the clustering stage, hierarchical clustering and K-means are used to cluster substations into groups based on the shape of the monitored load profiles. The classification tool designed with multinomial logistic regression maps an unmonitored LV substation into the most probable templates by using routinely available fixed data. Finally, clusterwise weighted constrained regression is employed to estimate peak for individual LV substations and the developed templates. The three-stage profiling is demonstrated on a practical system in the U.K. under the umbrella of a smart grid trail project. Ten LV templates are developed by using the metered data from 800 monitored LV substations. A comprehensive comparison between the estimated peaks using the three-stage process and the metered peaks suggests that the methodology can achieve superior accuracy. This is part I of the paper, introducing clustering and classification. The scaling (peak estimation) process will be introduced in part II of the paper.","doi":"10.1109/TPWRS.2014.2371474","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/59/7175086/06981990.pdf","startPage":"3036","endPage":"3044","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRS.2014.2371474","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7175086","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6981990","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Development of Low Voltage Network Templates\u2014Part I: Substation Clustering and Classification","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Development of Low Voltage Network Templates\u2014Part I: Substation Clustering and Classification","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6981990/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 December 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2015","volume":"30","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6981990/","dateOfInsertion":"03 August 2015","publicationDate":"Nov. 2015","accessionNumber":"15364645","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Development of Low Voltage Network Templates\u2014Part I: Substation Clustering and Classification","sourcePdf":"tpwrs-gu-2371474-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.096161S","chronDate":"Nov.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"59","isNumber":"7175086","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"51","xplore-issue":"7175086","articleId":"6981990","onlineDate":"10 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-16"},{"_id":6981992,"authors":[{"name":"Hiren J.

However, the decentralized architecture of ZigBee ad-hoc networks creates unique security challenges for network intrusion detection and prevention. In the past, ZigBee device authentication reliability was enhanced by Radio Frequency-Distinct Native Attribute (RF-DNA) fingerprinting using a Fisher-based Multiple Discriminant Analysis and Maximum Likelihood (MDA-ML) classification process to distinguish between devices in low Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) environments. However, MDA-ML performance inherently degrades when RF-DNA features do not satisfy Gaussian normality conditions, which often occurs in real-world scenarios where radio frequency (RF) multipath and interference from other devices is present. We introduce non-parametric Random Forest (RndF) and Multi-Class AdaBoost (MCA) ensemble classifiers into the RF-DNA fingerprinting arena, and demonstrate improved ZigBee device authentication. Results are compared with parametric MDA-ML and Generalized Relevance Learning Vector Quantization-Improved (GRLVQI) classifier results using identical input feature sets. Fingerprint dimensional reduction is examined using three methods, namely a pre-classification Kolmogorov-Smirnoff Test (KS-Test), a post-classification RndF feature relevance ranking, and a GRLVQI feature relevance ranking. Using the ensemble methods, an SNR=18.0 dB improvement over MDA-ML processing is realized at an arbitrary correct classification rate (%C) benchmark of %C=90%; for all SNR \u2208 [0, 30] dB considered, %C improvement over MDA-ML ranged from 9% to 24%. Relative to GRLVQI processing, ensemble methods again provided improvement for all SNR, with a best improvement of %C=10% achieved at the lowest tested SNR=0.0 dB. Network penetration, measured using rogue ZigBee devices, show that at the SNR=12.0 dB (%C=90%) the ensemble methods correctly reject 31 of 36 rogue access attempts based on Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve analysis and an arbitrary Rogue Accept Rate of . This performance is better than MDA-ML, and GRLVQI which rejected 25/36, and 28/36 rogue access attempts respectively. The key benefit of ensemble method processing is improved rogue rejection in noisier environments; gains of 6.0 dB, and 18.0 dB are realized over GRLVQI, and MDA-ML, respectively. Collectively considering the demonstrated %C and rogue rejection capability, the use of ensemble methods improves ZigBee network authentication, and enhances anti-spoofing protection afforded by RF-DNA fingerprinting.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6981992/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 December 2014","volume":"64","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"14948531","publicationDate":"March 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6981992/","dateOfInsertion":"27 February 2015","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Improving ZigBee Device Network Authentication Using Ensemble Decision Tree Classifiers With Radio Frequency Distinct Native Attribute Fingerprinting","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improving ZigBee Device Network Authentication Using Ensemble Decision Tree Classifiers With Radio Frequency Distinct Native Attribute Fingerprinting","sourcePdf":"tr-temple-2372432-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.088978S","chronDate":"March  2015","xplore-pub-id":"24","isNumber":"7051309","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"24","citationCount":"68","xplore-issue":"7051309","articleId":"6981992","onlineDate":"10 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6981994,"authors":[{"name":"Seyed Masoud Fatemi","affiliation":["Department of electrical engineering, Amirkabir University of Technology, Tehran, Iran"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/59/7175086/6981994/6981994-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Seyed Masoud Fatemi received the M.Sc. degree from the Electrical Engineering Department of Amirkabir University of Technology (Tehran Polytechnic), Iran (Center of Excellence on Power Systems in Iran).","His research interests include power systems modeling, operation and optimization, smart grids, restructuring and deregulation in power systems, and renewable energy."]},"firstName":"Seyed Masoud","lastName":"Fatemi","id":"37085453082"},{"name":"Sajjad Abedi","affiliation":["ECE department, Texas Tech University, Texas, United States"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/59/7175086/6981994/6981994-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Sajjad Abedi (S\u201911) received the B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees in electrical engineering in 2008 and 2011, from the Isfahan University of Technology and Amirkabir University of Technology, Iran respectively.

The presented versions of this model can be classified into two categories: state-dependent, or Hot-Start, models and state-independent, or Cold-Start, models. A reasonable accuracy is reported in the literature regarding Hot-Start models as they take into account branch losses and bus voltages by using available base point. On the contrary, due to the absence of base point in Cold-Start models, branch losses must be either neglected or guessed (which is an uncertain precautionary measure), or evaluated by a cumbersome iteration process. In addition, the bus voltage profiles are inevitably considered to be flat. Hence, the accuracy of available Cold-Start models in different circumstances remains of great concern. This paper addresses this concern and unveils a new Cold-Start model that does not rely on a risky assumption. In other words, there will be no lossless or flat voltage profile assumption in the presented approach whereas the equations remain linear. Besides, the exact effect of the net reactive loads on phase angles is considered and, consequently, the reactive power balance equations are reflected in the model for the first time.","doi":"10.1109/TPWRS.2014.2368572","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/59/7175086/06981994.pdf","startPage":"3012","endPage":"3023","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRS.2014.2368572","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7175086","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Introducing a Novel DC Power Flow Method With Reactive Power Considerations","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6981994","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 December 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6981994/","displayDocTitle":"Introducing a Novel DC Power Flow Method With Reactive Power Considerations","volume":"30","issue":"6","publicationDate":"Nov. 2015","accessionNumber":"15364637","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6981994/","dateOfInsertion":"03 August 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Introducing a Novel DC Power Flow Method With Reactive Power Considerations","sourcePdf":"tpwrs-abedi-2368572-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.099306S","chronDate":"Nov.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"59","isNumber":"7175086","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"47","xplore-issue":"7175086","articleId":"6981994","onlineDate":"10 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6981996,"authors":[{"name":"Ran Li","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University of Bath, Bath, UK"],"bio":{"p":["Ran Li (S\u201913) was born in Anhui province, China.

The CF for each LV template developed in part I of the paper is determined by a novel method-clusterwise weighted constrained regression (CWCR). It takes into account the contribution from different customer classes to substation peaks, respecting the natural difference in time and magnitude between LV substation peaks and the variance within the templates. In CWCR, intercept and coefficients are constrained to ensure that the resultant coefficients do not lead to reverse load flow and can respect zero-load substations. Cross validation is developed to validate the stability of the proposed method and prevent over fitting. The proposed method shows significant improvement in the accuracy of peak estimation over the current status quo across 800 substations of different mixes of domestic, industrial and commercial (I&C) customers. The work in the two parts of the paper is particularly useful for understanding the capabilities of LV networks to accommodate the increasing penetration of low carbon technologies without large-scale monitoring.","doi":"10.1109/TPWRS.2014.2371477","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRS.2014.2371477","startPage":"3045","endPage":"3052","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/59/7175086/06981996.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7175086","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Development of Low Voltage Network Templates\u2014Part II: Peak Load Estimation by Clusterwise Regression","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 December 2014","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2015","displayDocTitle":"Development of Low Voltage Network Templates\u2014Part II: Peak Load Estimation by Clusterwise Regression","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"03 August 2015","volume":"30","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6981996/","accessionNumber":"15364647","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6981996/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Development of Low Voltage Network Templates\u2014Part II: Peak Load Estimation by Clusterwise Regression","sourcePdf":"tpwrs-gu-2371477-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.068554S","chronDate":"Nov.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"59","isNumber":"7175086","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"7175086","articleId":"6981996","onlineDate":"10 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6981997,"authors":[{"name":"Michaelangelo D.

We find that PV variability distributions are roughly Gaussian after conditioning on hidden states. We also propose a method for simulating hidden states that results in a very good upper bound for the probability of extreme events. Therefore, the model can be used as a tool for planning additional reserve capacity requirements to balance solar variability over large and small spatial areas.","doi":"10.1109/TPWRS.2014.2372751","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/59/7175086/06981997.pdf","startPage":"2965","endPage":"2973","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRS.2014.2372751","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7175086","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modeling Variability and Uncertainty of Photovoltaic Generation: A Hidden State Spatial Statistical Approach","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6981997","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/59/7175086/6981997-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 December 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6981997/","displayDocTitle":"Modeling Variability and Uncertainty of Photovoltaic Generation: A Hidden State Spatial Statistical Approach","volume":"30","issue":"6","publicationDate":"Nov. 2015","accessionNumber":"15364632","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6981997/","dateOfInsertion":"03 August 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Modeling Variability and Uncertainty of Photovoltaic Generation: A Hidden State Spatial Statistical Approach","sourcePdf":"tpwrs-tabone-2372751-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.070941S","chronDate":"Nov.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"59","isNumber":"7175086","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"45","xplore-issue":"7175086","articleId":"6981997","onlineDate":"10 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"EU","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6982058,"authors":[{"name":"Danushka Jayasinghe","affiliation":["Smart Card Centre, Information Security Group, Royal Holloway, University of London, Egham, Surrey, UK"],"firstName":"Danushka","lastName":"Jayasinghe","id":"37085435620"},{"name":"Konstantinos Markantonakis","affiliation":["Smart Card Centre, Information Security Group, Royal Holloway, University of London, Egham, Surrey, UK"],"firstName":"Konstantinos","lastName":"Markantonakis","id":"37317956300"},{"name":"Keith Mayes","affiliation":["Smart Card Centre, Information Security Group, Royal Holloway, University of London, Egham, Surrey, UK"],"firstName":"Keith","lastName":"Mayes","id":"37317955400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6563-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-6562-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6982058","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":18,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":611},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6982058","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Protocols","Online banking","Encryption","Digital signatures","Public key","Silicon carbide"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electronic money"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["e-commerce transactions","Bitcoin","transaction irreversibility","consumer anonymity","merchant anonymity","payment method","trusted third party","protocol","TTP","dispute resolution","digital cash systems","public ledgers","Zerocoin/Zerocash","optimistic fair-exchange"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Optimistic Fair-Exchange","Anonymity","Bitcoin"]}],"abstract":"Fair-exchange and anonymity are two important attributes in e-commerce. It is much more difficult to expect fairness in e-commerce transactions using Bit coin due to anonymity and transaction irreversibility.

The proposed protocol guarantees strong-fairness while preserving anonymity of the consumer and the merchant, using Bit coin as a payment method which addresses the aforementioned concern. The involvement of the trusted third party (TTP) is kept to a minimum, which makes the protocol optimistic and the exchanged product is not revealed to TTP. It achieves dispute resolution within the protocol run without any intervention of an external judge.

HPC interconnects demand very high (\u2265 10 Gb/s) transmission rates using ultraefficient (~ 1 pJ/bit) transceivers over extremely short (\u2264 100 cm) ranges. In an attempt to design such wireless interconnects, first a model for the wireless communication channel properties is developed. The use of CMOS-based energyefficient on-off keying (OOK) transceiver architectures operating in the 60-90 GHz bands is considered as a practical solution. In order to address strict performance requirements of wireless HPC interconnects, and taking advantage of the recent developments in device scaling, compact low-power and innovative circuits based on novel double-gate MOSFETs (DG-MOSFETs) are proposed in the implementation of the architecture. The performance of a compact low-noise amplifier (LNA) design using common source (CS) inductive degeneration with 32 nm DGMOSFETs is investigated by quantitative analysis and simulation. The proposed inductor-less two-stage cascode cascade LNA is optimized for 90 GHz operation and has the advantage of gain switching over its CMOS counterpart without the use of additional switching transistors, which makes it remarkably power efficient and faster. As further examples of efficient and compact DG-MOSFET circuits for OOK transceiver design, a three-stage CS 5 dB tunable power amplifier operating up to 90 GHz, and a novel 90 GHz voltage controlled oscillator are also presented. This is followed by the proposal of an array of four monopole antennas studied using full-wave EM solver.","doi":"10.1109/TCAD.2014.2379640","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on

Specifically, we discuss the development of estimators and analytically determine their attainable variance for two conditions: 1) when full channel state information (CSI) is available at the transmitter and receiver; and 2) when only channel gain statistics and phase information are available. For the case where full CSI is available, we formulate an optimization problem to allocate power among each of the transmitting sensors while minimizing the estimate variance. We show that minimizing the estimate variance when the transmitter is operating in its most nonlinear region can be formulated in a manner very similar to optimizing sensor gains with full CSI and linear transmitters. Furthermore, we show that the solution to this optimization problem in most scenarios is approximately equivalent to one of two low-complexity power allocation systems.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sensors","Noise measurement","Noise","Optimization","Mathematical model","Estimation","Channel estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplify and forward communication","channel estimation","minimisation","radio receivers","radio transmitters","statistical analysis","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nonlinear amplify-and-forward distributed estimation","nonidentical channel","wireless system","full channel state information","radio receiver","channel gain statistics","phase information","optimization problem","estimate variance minimization","linear transmitter","low-complexity power allocation system"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["distributed estimation","predistortion","nonlinearityamplifiers","energy efficiency"]},{"kwd":["Amplifiers","distributed estimation","energy efficiency","nonlinearity","predistortion"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TVT.2014.2381094","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/7323911/06982200.pdf","startPage":"5390","endPage":"5395","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7323911","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2014.2381094","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Nonlinear Amplify-and-Forward Distributed Estimation Over Nonidentical Channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6982200","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Nonlinear Amplify-and-Forward Distributed Estimation Over Nonidentical Channels","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6982200/","volume":"64","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6982200/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"15587062","dateOfInsertion":"10 November 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 December 2014","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Science Foundation FRP Award","grantNumber":"1231034"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Nonlinear Amplify-and-Forward Distributed Estimation Over Nonidentical Channels","sourcePdf":"tvt-banavar-2381094-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.082518S","chronDate":"Nov.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"7323911","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7323911","articleId":"6982200","onlineDate":"11 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6982202,"authors":[{"name":"Qinghua Huang","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Qinghua","lastName":"Huang","id":"37405854200"},{"name":"Yanping Huang","affiliation":["Department of Bioengineering, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA"],"firstName":"Yanping","lastName":"Huang","id":"37085412071"},{"name":"Wei Hu","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Hu","id":"37085411348"},{"name":"Xuelong Li","affiliation":["Center for Optical Imagery Analysis and Learning (OPTIMAL), State Key Laboratory of Transient Optics and Photonics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Xuelong","lastName":"Li","id":"37293192200"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2168-2291"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2168-2305"}],"articleNumber":"6982202","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":35,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":766},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interpolation","Image reconstruction","Probes","Phantoms","Arrays","Accuracy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["curve fitting","image reconstruction","interpolation","solid modelling","ultrasonic imaging"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3D freehand ultrasound","anatomical objects","2D B-mode US images","voxel intensities","B-scans","3D freehand US reconstruction","third-order Bezier curves","freehand 3D US system","Bezier interpolation algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Bezier curve","freehand ultrasound (US)","real-time imaging","signal interpolation","sparse data","3-D reconstruction"]},{"kwd":["Bezier curve","freehand ultrasound (US)","real-time imaging","signal interpolation","sparse data","3-D reconstruction"]}],"abstract":"Freehand 3-D ultrasound (US) produces 3-D volume data of anatomical objects from a sequence of irregularly located 2-D B-mode US images (B-scans). In 3-D US, the voxel intensities are calculated by interpolating those pixels from raw B-scans. Current interpolation algorithms do not consider sparsity of the raw data and are time consuming in computation. In this paper, we aim to perform the 3-D reconstruction of freehand US with sparse raw data in a more efficient manner. A novel interpolation algorithm takes advantage of Bezier curves. A single sweep of raw B-scans is collected, and the third-order Bezier curves are employed for approximating the voxels located in a control window. In in vitro and in vivo experiments, a fetus phantom and a subject's forearm were scanned using the freehand 3-D US system and reconstructed using the proposed Bezier interpolation algorithm and three popular interpolation algorithms, respectively. The results showed that the proposed algorithm significantly outperformed the other three algorithms when the raw B-scans were relatively sparse and the interpolation error in gray level can be reduced by 0.51-5.07. The speed for 3-D reconstruction can be improved by 90.6-97.2 because a single third-order Bezier curve using four control points (i.e., the pixel points) is able to estimate more than four voxels, whereas the estimation of a voxel value often requires a number of pixels in conventional techniques.","doi":"10.1109/THMS.2014.2374551","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Human-Machine Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/6221037/7106592/06982202.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7106592","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/THMS.2014.2374551","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Human-Machine Systems","startPage":"385","endPage":"392","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bezier Interpolation for 3-D Freehand Ultrasound","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6982202","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 December 2014","displayDocTitle":"Bezier Interpolation for 3-D Freehand Ultrasound","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6982202/","volume":"45","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/6982202/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15125559","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program)","grantNumber":"2012CB316400"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61125106 and 61372007"},{"fundingName":"Key Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences","grantNumber":"KGZD-EW-T03"},{"fundingName":"Guangdong Provincial department of Education Projects of Innovative Science and Technology","grantNumber":"2013KJCX0012"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bezier Interpolation for 3-D Freehand Ultrasound","sourcePdf":"thms-huang-2374551-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.134132S","chronDate":"June  2015","xplore-pub-id":"6221037","isNumber":"7106592","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6221037","citationCount":"35","xplore-issue":"7106592","articleId":"6982202","onlineDate":"11 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6982203,"authors":[{"name":"Yongseok Lim","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Korea University, Seoul, Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/7154538/6982203/lim-small.gif","p":["Yongseok Lim received the B.S. degree in electronics engineering and\n the M.S. degree in ultralarge scale integration digital system from Korea University, Seoul, Korea, in 2001 and 2003,\n respectively, where he is currently working toward the Ph.D degree in electrical engineering.","He was with the ASIC Lab, Central Research Institute, Samsung Electro-Mechanics Inc., from 2003 to 2005.

Although those approaches are effective to increase transfer efficiencies, the transferred energy can easily be wasted due to leakage flux of nondirectional fields. In this paper, we present a novel magnetic field shaping technology for improving the energy efficiency in a near-field WPT system. In this study, the beamforming techniques that have been used for radio frequency systems are efficiently exploited in a WPT system to improve the transfer efficiencies by minimizing unnecessary leakage flux. The optimal antenna structure for energy forming is first determined through mathematical analysis. Using the proposed crossed antennas, the phase-control method is effectively used to form magnetic fields in particular directions. The proposed energy forming-based WPT system using crossed antennas is implemented with the phase control of three-power stack transmitters. The experimental results matches well with the theoretical analysis, and the energy-forming approach for synthesizing the magnetic fields achieves average improvements of the transfer efficiency and transfer distance of up to 20.1% and 30%, respectively, over the conventional nonradiative energy transfer approach at 1 m distance.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2014.2379672","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7154538","startPage":"6274","endPage":"6287","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/63/7154538/06982203.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Novel Phase-Control-Based Energy Beamforming Techniques in Nonradiative Wireless Power Transfer","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6982203/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 December 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6982203/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Novel Phase-Control-Based Energy Beamforming Techniques in Nonradiative Wireless Power Transfer","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2015","accessionNumber":"15289530","dateOfInsertion":"10 July 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"30","issue":"11","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001321","fundingName":"National Research Foundation"},{"fundingName":"Korea Government (MSIP)","grantNumber":"2012-0020128 and 2012R1A2A2A01012471"},{"fundingName":"IT R&D Program of KEIT"},{"fundingName":"Korea Government (MOTIE)","grantNumber":"10042250"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel Phase-Control-Based Energy Beamforming Techniques in Nonradiative Wireless Power Transfer","sourcePdf":"tpel-park-2379672-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.107934S","chronDate":"Nov.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"7154538","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"7154538","articleId":"6982203","onlineDate":"11 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6982207,"authors":[{"name":"Shang Li","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5165411/7300477/6982207/li-2374577-small.gif","p":["Shang Li received the B.Sc. degree in electronics from Peking University, Beijing, China, and the M.Phil. degree in electronic and computer engineering from the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, in 2010 and 2012, respectively.

The unknown parameters in the system, namely the state vector, injected malicious data and the set of attacked meters pose a significant challenge for designing a robust, computationally efficient, and high-performance detector. We propose a sequential detector based on the generalized likelihood ratio to address this challenge. Specifically, the proposed detector is designed to be robust to a variety of attacking strategies, and load situations in the power system, and its computational complexity linearly scales with the number of meters. Moreover, it considerably outperforms the existing first-order cumulative sum detector in terms of the average detection delay and robustness to various attacking strategies. For wide-area monitoring in smart grid, we further develop a distributed sequential detector using an adaptive sampling technique called level-triggered sampling. The resulting distributed detector features single bit per sample in terms of the communication overhead, while preserving the high performance of the proposed centralized detector.","doi":"10.1109/TSG.2014.2374577","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid","pdfPath":"/iel7/5165411/7300477/06982207.pdf","startPage":"2725","endPage":"2735","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7300477","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSG.2014.2374577","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Quickest Detection of False Data Injection Attack in Wide-Area Smart Grids","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6982207","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2015","displayDocTitle":"Quickest Detection of False Data Injection Attack in Wide-Area Smart Grids","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6982207/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"15566981","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6982207/","volume":"6","issue":"6","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 December 2014","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"CIF1064575"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000006","fundingName":"Office of Naval Research","grantNumber":"N000141410667 and TSG-00398-2014"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Quickest Detection of False Data Injection Attack in Wide-Area Smart Grids","sourcePdf":"tsg-wang-2374577-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.100502S","chronDate":"Nov.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"5165411","isNumber":"7300477","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5165411","citationCount":"168","xplore-issue":"7300477","articleId":"6982207","onlineDate":"11 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6982217,"authors":[{"name":"Mihaela Alexandru","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Chair for Electron Devices and Integrated Circuits (CEDIC), Technische Universit\u00e4t Dresden, Dresden, Germany"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/7080969/6982217/alexa-2379212-small.gif","p":["\nMihaela Alexandru received the M.Sc. degree in \nmicroelectronics from the Polytechnic University of Bucharest, Bucharest, Romania, in 2008 and the Ph.D. degree in \nelectronic engineering from the Polytechnic University of Catalu\u00f1a, Barcelona, Spain, in 2013.","In 2009, she joined the Group of Power Devices and Systems, IMB-CNM (CSIC), Barcelona.

To this end, multilevel spatial hierarchical modulation (MSHM) is proposed to provide UEP in Rician fading channels when both the high priority (HP) and the low-priority information streams are jointly encoded in the spatial and signal domains. A phase-aided multilevel space-shift keying scheme is employed in the spatial domain to enhance HP performance, whereas in the signal domain, hierarchical modulation is employed. The joint space-signal constellation related to the LOS component of the received signal is appropriately formed to provide higher protection to the HP stream while, at the same time, being capable of providing different levels of protection by adjusting the transmission parameters of the spatial and signal schemes when they are jointly employed. By incorporating the Rician factor to the parameters of the proposed MSHM scheme, the latter is made adaptive to the fading conditions. Simulations have been performed to assess the performance and demonstrate the design options offered by the proposed MSHM scheme.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6982224/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 December 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6982224/","dateOfInsertion":"10 November 2015","publicationDate":"Nov. 2015","accessionNumber":"15587037","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"64","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Multilevel Spatial Hierarchical Modulation: An Efficient Scheme for Unequal Error Protection Under Rician Fading","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"SYNAISHISI"},{"fundingName":"Greek General Secretariat for R&T"},{"fundingName":"Ministry of Education & RA"},{"fundingName":"European RDF of the EC under the Operational Program Competitiveness and Entrepreneurship (OPCE II),"},{"fundingName":"Development Grants For Research Institutions (KRIPIS)"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multilevel Spatial Hierarchical Modulation: An Efficient Scheme for Unequal Error Protection Under Rician Fading","sourcePdf":"tvt-zamkotsian-2379671-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.071356S","chronDate":"Nov.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"7323911","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"7323911","articleId":"6982224","onlineDate":"11 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6982231,"authors":[{"name":"Hongyu Wu","affiliation":["Power Systems Engineering Center, National Renewable Energy Laboratory, Golden, CO, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Hongyu Wu (M\u201909) received the B.S. degree in energy and power engineering and the Ph.D. degree in system engineering from Xi'an Jiaotong University, China, in 2003 and 2011, respectively.","He is a researcher at the Power Systems Engineering Center at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) in Golden, CO, USA.

The method is based on the extraction of a nonlinear admittance function, which describes the circuit response from the input source terminals. It does not require any optimization or parameter switching procedures, this constituting a significant advantage compared with previous analysis techniques. With additional mathematical conditions, it enables a straightforward determination of the turning point and Hopf bifurcation loci that delimit the stable injection-locked operation bands. The codimension two bifurcation point at which the turning point and Hopf bifurcation loci merge is analyzed in detail, as well as the saddle-connection locus. As it is shown, a second intersection of the saddle-connection locus with the turning point locus acts as a boundary between synchronization points and points associated with jumps and hysteresis. The likely observation of chaotic solutions in the neighborhood of the saddle-connection locus is discussed too. The techniques have been validated by application to several injection-locked oscillators, obtaining good agreement with the experimental results.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7000613","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.2014.2376556","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel7/22/7000613/06982235.pdf","startPage":"181","endPage":"197","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.2014.2376556","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient Simulation of Solution Curves and Bifurcation Loci in Injection-Locked Oscillators","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2015","displayDocTitle":"Efficient Simulation of Solution Curves and Bifurcation Loci in Injection-Locked Oscillators","volume":"63","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/6982235/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2015","accessionNumber":"14835092","dateOfInsertion":"31 December 2014","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6982235/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 December 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient Simulation of Solution Curves and Bifurcation Loci in Injection-Locked Oscillators","sourcePdf":"tmtt-decos-2376556-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.104489S","chronDate":"Jan.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"7000613","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"7000613","articleId":"6982235","onlineDate":"11 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6982236,"authors":[{"name":"Emilio Barocio","affiliation":["Imperial College London, London, NE, UK"],"bio":{"p":["Emilio Barocio (M\u201999) received the M.E. degree from the University of Guadalajara, Jalisco, Mexico, and the Ph.D. degree from CINVESTAV, Guadalajara, Mexico, in 1998, and 2003, respectively, all in electrical engineering.","Currently, he is an Associate Professor of power systems in the Department of Mechanical and Electrical Engineering, University of Guadalajara."]},"firstName":"Emilio","lastName":"Barocio","id":"37271466200"},{"name":"Bikash C.

Nevertheless, little work has been dedicated to the quality assessment of fused images created from natural images captured at multiple exposure levels. In this work, we first build a database that contains source input images with multiple exposure levels (\u2265 3) together with fused images generated by both classical and state-of-the-art image fusion algorithms. We then carry out a subjective user study using a multi-stimulus scoring approach to evaluate and compare the quality of the fused images. Considerable agreement between human subjects has been observed.

In this work, the influence of several adaptation parameters, namely, switch amplitude (i.e., quality level difference), switching frequency, and recency effects, on Quality of Experience (QoE) is investigated. Therefore, crowdsourcing experiments were conducted in order to collect subjective ratings for different adaptation-related test conditions.

In fact, the varying viewing distance between audiences and the display seriously affect the IQA accuracy, which has been largely overlooked. To this end, in this paper we take into account the image size and viewing distance as well as the preferential activation of V1 cells by vertical and horizontal contours, and thereby propose an adaptive frequency selection (AFS) model to preprocess input visual signals before IQA metrics are used. Our algorithm works by first applying Fourier Transform (FT) to the reference and distorted images to approximate the low-pass behavior of the human visual system, then extracting proper amount of low frequency components and partial high frequency components corresponding to vertical and horizontal directions, and finally reconstructing spatial images with the inverse FT. We validate the performance of AFS based PSNR and SSIM on the related LIVE, Toyama and IVC databases with clearly specified viewing conditions. Experimental results and comparative studies show the effectiveness of the proposed model.","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 Sixth International Workshop on Quality of Multimedia Experience (QoMEX)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6971858/6982273/06982318.pdf","startPage":"189","endPage":"194","publicationTitle":"2014 Sixth International Workshop on Quality of Multimedia Experience (QoMEX)","doi":"10.1109/QoMEX.2014.6982318","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/QoMEX.2014.6982318","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6982273","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6982318","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Effective preprocessing stage in the fourier transform domain for image quality assessment","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["PSNR","Databases","Fourier transforms","Image quality","Frequency-domain analysis","Conferences"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Fourier transforms","image reconstruction","inverse transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Fourier transform","image quality assessment","image size","viewing distance","V1 cells preferential activation","adaptive frequency selection","AFS model","IQA metrics","human visual system low-pass behavior","spatial image reconstruction","inverse FT","PSNR","SSIM","IVC database","Toyama database","LIVE database","peak signal-to-noise ratio","structural similarity index"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Image quality assessment (IQA)","Fourier transform (FT)","image size","viewing distance","human visual system (HVS)","V1 cells"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6982318/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 Sept. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Effective preprocessing stage in the fourier transform domain for image quality assessment","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6982318/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","accessionNumber":"14826915","dateOfInsertion":"15 December 2014","conferenceDate":"18-20 Sept. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Effective preprocessing stage in the fourier transform domain for image quality assessment","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"1569976319.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.119058S","chronDate":"18-20 Sept. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6971858","isNumber":"6982273","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6971858","xplore-issue":"6982273","articleId":"6982318","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6982328,"authors":[{"name":"Huan Yang","affiliation":["School of Computer Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Huan","lastName":"Yang","id":"38504811300"},{"name":"Yuming Fang","affiliation":["School of Information Technology, Jiangxi University of Finance and Economics, Nanchang, Jiangxi, China"],"lastName":"Yuming Fang","id":"37087616553"},{"name":"Weisi Lin","affiliation":["School of Computer Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Weisi","lastName":"Lin","id":"37278116000"},{"name":"Zhou Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Waterloo, Canada"],"firstName":"Zhou","lastName":"Wang","id":"37291903900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6536-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6982328","dbTime":"19 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":20,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":456},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Correlation","Transform coding","Measurement","Predictive models","Visualization","Databases","Image coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image processing","visual databases"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["subjective quality assessment","screen content images","SCI","multidevice communication applications","visual quality","large-scale screen image quality assessment database","SIQAD","prediction model","human quality judgement","IQA methods","textual regions","pictorial regions","ACR","absolute category rating"]}],"abstract":"Research on Screen Content Images (SCIs) becomes important as they are increasingly used in multi-device communication applications. In this paper, we present a study of subjective quality assessment for distorted SCIs, and investigate which part (text or picture) contributes more to the overall visual quality. We construct a large-scale Screen Image Quality Assessment Database (SIQAD) consisting of 20 source and 980 distorted SCIs. The 11-category Absolute Category Rating (ACR) is employed to obtain three subjective quality scores corresponding to the entire image, textual and pictorial regions respectively. Based on the subjective data, we investigate the applicability of 12 state-of-the-art Image Quality Assessment (IQA) methods for objectively assessing the quality of SCIs. The results indicate that existing IQA methods are limited in predicting human quality judgement of SCIs. Moreover, we propose a prediction model to account for the correlation between the subjective scores of textual and pictorial regions and the entire image.

A laboratory set-up has been built and some tests of the interaction between the FAD and a user were performed. The stability of the closed loop system is essential for the performance of the FAD. The FAD by itself is a stable device, but what is important is to assure the stability of the interaction between the FAD and a human being. To deal with this matter, two situations were analyzed. The case of no delays in the model is first considered. This situation might appear unrealistic, for this reason, a second analysis is performed considering a human model with delays. In order to deal with delays a Rekasius substitution is used. To perform the stability analysis, it is sufficient to apply the Routh-Hurtwitz criteria. Attempts with other techniques have given more conservative stability results. The stability has been proven for delays smaller than upper-bounds which have been computed. None of these upper-bounds are reached by any healthy human being. Therefore, we can assure that the whole system is stable for most of the practical situations. This proves the robustness of the closed loop system with respect to delays. In real time experiments, measurement from the sensors are normally noisy. In order to reduce the effect of the noise, a low pass filter was included. The introduction of this filter alters the order of the system, changing the stability conditions of the whole set up. So the stability analysis is performed again with the inclusion of the filter.","doi":"10.1109/ICSTCC.2014.6982382","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6982378","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSTCC.2014.6982382","publicationTitle":"2014 18th International Conference on System Theory, Control and Computing (ICSTCC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 18th International Conference on System Theory, Control and Computing (ICSTCC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6961601/6982378/06982382.pdf","startPage":"7","endPage":"12","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Study of the interaction between a one degree of freedom force augmenting device and a human operator","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"17-19 Oct. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Study of the interaction between a one degree of freedom force augmenting device and a human operator","isConference":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 Oct. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"15 December 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6982382/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","accessionNumber":"14826467","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6982382/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Study of the interaction between a one degree of freedom force augmenting device and a human operator","confLoc":"Sinaia, Romania","sourcePdf":"FrA102.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.08538S","chronDate":"17-19 Oct. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6961601","isNumber":"6982378","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6961601","xplore-issue":"6982378","articleId":"6982382","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6982400,"authors":[{"name":"Razvan Solea","affiliation":["Faculty of Automatic Control, Computers, Electrical and Electronics Engineering, \u201cDunarea de Jos\u201d University of Galati, Romania"],"firstName":"Razvan","lastName":"Solea","id":"37541825600"},{"name":"Daniela Cernega","affiliation":["Faculty of Automatic Control, Computers, Electrical and Electronics Engineering, \u201cDunarea de Jos\u201d University of Galati, Romania"],"firstName":"Daniela","lastName":"Cernega","id":"37541833500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-4601-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6982400","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":167},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Trajectory","Acceleration","Planning","Splines (mathematics)","Mobile robots"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["acceleration control","mobile robots","motion control","particle swarm optimisation","path planning","splines (mathematics)","trajectory control","velocity control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["trajectory planner","mobile robot","particle swarm optimization","temporal motion law","geometric path","motion planning","trajectory planning problem","quintic splines","position","curvature","velocity","acceleration","spatial dimension","temporal dimension"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6982400","abstract":"The trajectory planning problem is an essential one in robotics. In order to solve this problem, a temporal motion law for a given geometric path has to be defined and a set of requirements for the trajectory has to be fulfilled. The motion planning of a mobile robot must be more than just collision-free: it must be fast, safe and easy to use. For the trajectory planning problem, minimum time to achieve the goal is an important criterion. This paper proposes an original trajectory planning approach using quintic splines in a real environment with several obstacles. The proposed trajectory planning approach is based on the optimization of parameters of the quintic splines using Particle Swarm Optimization. The quintic-splines are ideal since they give continuity in position, heading, curvature, velocity, and acceleration ensuring a smooth movement of the mobile robot. The trajectory planning must provide not only the planning of the path (spatial dimension) but also the speed profile (temporal dimension). The effectiveness of the proposed planner is proved with suitable examples. The experiments show that the proposed planner is able to provide a smooth trajectory.","doi":"10.1109/ICSTCC.2014.6982400","startPage":"111","endPage":"116","publicationTitle":"2014 18th International Conference on System Theory, Control and Computing (ICSTCC)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSTCC.2014.6982400","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6982378","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 18th International Conference on System Theory, Control and Computing (ICSTCC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6961601/6982378/06982400.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Trajectory planner for mobile robots using particle swarm optimization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6982400/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Trajectory planner for mobile robots using particle swarm optimization","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6982400/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"14826535","publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"15 December 2014","conferenceDate":"17-19 Oct. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 Oct. 2014","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Trajectory planner for mobile robots using particle swarm optimization","confLoc":"Sinaia, Romania","sourcePdf":"FrA405.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058795S","chronDate":"17-19 Oct. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6961601","isNumber":"6982378","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6961601","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6982378","articleId":"6982400","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6982402,"authors":[{"name":"Anamaria Vizitiu","affiliation":["Corporate Technology, Siemens SRL, Transilvania University of Bra\u015fov, Bra\u015fov, Romania"],"firstName":"Anamaria","lastName":"Vizitiu","id":"37085364120"},{"name":"Lucian Itu","affiliation":["Corporate Technology, Siemens SRL, Transilvania University of Bra\u015fov, Bra\u015fov, Romania"],"firstName":"Lucian","lastName":"Itu","id":"37543223900"},{"name":"Laszlo Lazar","affiliation":["Corporate Technology, Siemens SRL, Transilvania University of Bra\u015fov, Bra\u015fov, Romania"],"firstName":"Laszlo","lastName":"Lazar","id":"37085345352"},{"name":"Constantin Suciu","affiliation":["Corporate Technology, Siemens SRL, Transilvania University of Bra\u015fov, Bra\u015fov, Romania"],"firstName":"Constantin","lastName":"Suciu","id":"37328219500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-4601-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6982402","dbTime":"17 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":79},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Instruction sets","Graphics processing units","Kernel","Organizations","Registers","Arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["graphics processing units","optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["double precision stencil computation","graphics processing units","stencil based algorithm","GPU based acceleration","seven-point stencil","two-dimensional thread organization","three-dimensional thread organization","optimization technique","NVIDIA Kepler GPU","GTX680 card"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["stencil","GPU","double precision","Kepler","optimization"]}],"abstract":"Graphics Processing Units (GPU) have been used extensively for accelerating parallelizable applications in general, and scientific computations in particular.

The complexity of this function increases for hand and fingers control because of the high diversity and accuracy of the possible motions. Starting from the control mechanisms of the natural muscle we developed a structure of spiking neurons implemented in PCB hardware that is able to drive the elbow of a human-like robotic arm. In order to increase the biological plausibility of the designed robotic arm driving system, the artificial neural network controls artificial muscles that are implemented with Flexinol actuator wires. From our knowledge the control of the actuator wires using spiking neural networks was not performed previously. The results show that the excitatory spiking neurons are able to flex and straighten the artificial elbow by stimulating two antagonistic actuator wires. Moreover, by using inhibitory neurons that modulate the neural excitatory activity the arm mobile segment can be driven to specific positions. Our final goal is the development of a biologically plausible neural structure that is able to easily drive the hand and fingers of a human-like robotic arm by controlling the artificial muscles implemented with actuator wires. This will give important clues for future developments of spiking neural networks that drive robotic arms for performing complex tasks.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spiking neural network for controlling the artificial muscles of a humanoid robotic arm","doi":"10.1109/ICSTCC.2014.6982409","endPage":"168","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 18th International Conference on System Theory, Control and Computing (ICSTCC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6961601/6982378/06982409.pdf","publicationTitle":"2014 18th International Conference on System Theory, Control and Computing (ICSTCC)","startPage":"163","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSTCC.2014.6982409","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6982378","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6982409","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neurons","Muscles","Wires","Biological neural networks","Actuators","Force","Robots"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["humanoid robots","manipulators","medical robotics","neurocontrollers","pneumatic actuators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["spiking neural network","artificial muscles control","humanoid robotic arm","human nervous system","hand control","fingers control","control mechanisms","natural muscle","spiking neurons structure","PCB hardware","human-like robotic arm","biological plausibility","robotic arm driving system","artificial neural network","Flexinol actuator wires control","excitatory spiking neurons","artificial elbow","antagonistic actuator wires","inhibitory neurons","neural excitatory activity","arm mobile segment"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["human-like robotic arm","spiking neural networks","analogue bio-inspired neuron","flexinol actuator wires"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Spiking neural network for controlling the artificial muscles of a humanoid robotic arm","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6982409/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 Oct. 2014","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6982409/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","conferenceDate":"17-19 Oct. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"15 December 2014","accessionNumber":"14826427","isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spiking neural network for controlling the artificial muscles of a humanoid robotic arm","confLoc":"Sinaia, Romania","sourcePdf":"FrB104.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078293S","chronDate":"17-19 Oct. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6961601","isNumber":"6982378","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6961601","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6982378","articleId":"6982409","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6982440,"authors":[{"name":"Daniela Danciu","affiliation":["Department of Automation, Electronics and Mechatronics, University of Craiova, Craiova, Romania"],"firstName":"Daniela","lastName":"Danciu","id":"37973006200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-4601-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6982440","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":43},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6982440","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Mathematical model","Approximation methods","Equations","Computational modeling","Cloning","Boundary conditions","Cellular neural networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["boundary-value problems","cellular neural nets","hyperbolic equations","mechanical contact","mechanical engineering computing","method of lines","partial differential equations","rods (structures)","variational techniques","vibrations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed parameter system","contact mechanics","modelling","computational issues","cellular neural networks paradigm","longitudinal vibrations","rods","mathematical model","calculus of variation methods","mixed initial boundary value problem","hyperbolic partial differential equations","derivative boundaries","neural mathematics","method of lines"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICSTCC.2014.6982440","pdfPath":"/iel7/6961601/6982378/06982440.pdf","publicationTitle":"2014 18th International Conference on System Theory, Control and Computing (ICSTCC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 18th International Conference on System Theory, Control and Computing (ICSTCC)","startPage":"347","endPage":"352","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6982378","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSTCC.2014.6982440","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed parameter system from Contact mechanics: Modelling and computational issues based on cellular neural networks paradigm","abstract":"The paper deals with modelling and computational issues for a unified model from the Contact Mechanics belonging to the class of longitudinal vibrations of rods.

Safety concerns in automotive industry require monitoring of the system to ensure a correct and safe operation of the electric vehicle. This paper presents three software methods for estimating the winding electrical resistance and detecting an open phase failure during torque control operation of a PMSM. All three methods can be applied online. Differences between these methods are reflected into computational effort and efficiency. The described methods were numerically simulated and tested in MATLAB. The first two methods monitor the electrical resistance of the stator windings which are estimated through an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) and an Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF). Hence, the three phase model and the rotating reference frame model are both used as internal models for the proposed Kalman filters and the estimation performance is evaluated in each case. In order to detect an open phase fault, the gradient of the estimated electrical resistance is monitored. The third method which is independent of the motor parameters calculates the Discrete Fourier Transformation (DFT) coefficients of the fundamental frequency in the phase currents signals. Hence, due to the low computational effort and good performance, the Goertzel algorithm is proposed. Conclusions are drawn based on estimation accuracy, time response and complexity of each method.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Phase resistance estimation and monitoring of PMSM used in electrical vehicles","publicationTitle":"2014 18th International Conference on System Theory, Control and Computing (ICSTCC)","doi":"10.1109/ICSTCC.2014.6982468","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 18th International Conference on System Theory, Control and Computing (ICSTCC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6961601/6982378/06982468.pdf","startPage":"512","endPage":"519","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSTCC.2014.6982468","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6982378","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6982468","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6982468/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 Oct. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Phase resistance estimation and monitoring of PMSM used in electrical vehicles","conferenceDate":"17-19 Oct. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6982468/","dateOfInsertion":"15 December 2014","publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","accessionNumber":"14833316","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Phase resistance estimation and monitoring of PMSM used in electrical vehicles","confLoc":"Sinaia, Romania","sourcePdf":"SaD103.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.149071S","chronDate":"17-19 Oct. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6961601","isNumber":"6982378","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6961601","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6982378","articleId":"6982468","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":6982503,"authors":[{"name":"Leti\u0163ia Mirea","affiliation":["Department of Automatic Control and Applied Informatics, \u201cGh.

These systems rely on monitoring and detection of intrusions, thus composing an additional line of defense. Several paradigms have been applied for implementing IDS. In this paper we propose a NIDS model based on Information Gain for feature selection and Support Vector Machines(SVM) for the detection component. SVM is a feed forward neural network with many advantages that comply with the requirements of an IDS. One drawback of this classification algorithm is that its performance depends on some input parameters. Our solution for this optimization problem is to apply swarm intelligence. We test our approach with the NSL-KDD data set and show that our model can obtain better results than regular SVM or PSO-SVM.","doi":"10.1109/ICSTCC.2014.6982526","startPage":"856","endPage":"861","publicationTitle":"2014 18th International Conference on System Theory, Control and Computing (ICSTCC)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSTCC.2014.6982526","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6982378","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 18th International Conference on System Theory, Control and Computing (ICSTCC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6961601/6982378/06982526.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Anomaly intrusions detection based on support vector machines with bat algorithm","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6982526/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Anomaly intrusions detection based on support vector machines with bat algorithm","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6982526/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"14826471","publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"15 December 2014","conferenceDate":"17-19 Oct. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 Oct. 2014","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Anomaly intrusions detection based on support vector machines with bat algorithm","confLoc":"Sinaia, Romania","sourcePdf":"SuF301.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.116558S","chronDate":"17-19 Oct. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6961601","isNumber":"6982378","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6961601","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6982378","articleId":"6982526","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6982624,"authors":[{"name":"Xin Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada"],"firstName":"Xin","lastName":"Chen","id":"37085414256"},{"name":"Charng-Da Lu","affiliation":["Unaffiliated, New York, USA"],"firstName":"Charng-Da","lastName":"Lu","id":"37085412368"},{"name":"Karthik Pattabiraman","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada"],"firstName":"Karthik","lastName":"Pattabiraman","id":"37396625600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6033-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-6032-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1071-9458"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2332-6549"}],"articleNumber":"6982624","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":36,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":892},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6982624","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Google","Maintenance engineering","Containers","Correlation","Availability","Log-normal distribution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","failure analysis","system recovery"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["failure analysis","compute clouds","Google cloud cluster","job failures","task failures","scheduling constraints","failure prediction","anomaly detection","user profiles"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Job failure","distributions","failure prediction","cloud reliability","anomaly detection"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we analyze a workload trace from the Google cloud cluster and characterize the observed failures.

Based on our results, we speculate that there are many opportunities to enhance the reliability of the applications running in the cloud, such as pro-active maintenance of nodes or limiting job resubmissions.

Conventionally, training-based methods assume that anomalies are events with rare appearance, which suffer from visual scale, complexity of normal events and insufficiency of training data. Instead, we make the assumption that anomalies are events that attract human attentions. Temporal and spatial anomaly saliency are considered consistently by representing the value of each pixel in each frame as a quaternion composed of intensity, contour, motion-speed and motion-direction feature. For each quaternion frame, Quaternion Discrete Cosine Transformation (QDCT) and signature operation are applied. The spatio-temporal anomaly saliency map is developed by inverse QDCT and Gaussian smoothing. Abnormal events appear at those areas with high saliency values. Experiments on typical datasets show that our method can achieve high accuracy results.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings 2014 IEEE International Conference on Security, Pattern Analysis, and Cybernetics (SPAC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6971853/6982642/06982654.pdf","startPage":"42","endPage":"47","publicationTitle":"Proceedings 2014 IEEE International Conference on Security, Pattern Analysis, and Cybernetics (SPAC)","doi":"10.1109/SPAC.2014.6982654","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPAC.2014.6982654","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6982642","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6982654","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Abnormal event detection in crowd scenes using quaternion discrete cosine transformation signature","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Quaternions","Visualization","Event detection","Smoothing methods","Discrete cosine transforms","Image reconstruction","Training"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer vision","discrete cosine transforms","image motion analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Gaussian smoothing","inverse QDCT","spatio-temporal anomaly saliency map","signature operation","quaternion frame","motion-direction feature","spatial anomaly saliency","training-based methods","human visual system","saliency attention mechanism","abnormal event detection system","quaternion discrete cosine transformation signature","crowd scenes"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6982654/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-19 Oct. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Abnormal event detection in crowd scenes using quaternion discrete cosine transformation signature","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6982654/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","accessionNumber":"14833652","dateOfInsertion":"15 December 2014","conferenceDate":"18-19 Oct. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Abnormal event detection in crowd scenes using quaternion discrete cosine transformation signature","confLoc":"Wuhan, China","sourcePdf":"0004200070.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055382S","chronDate":"18-19 Oct. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6971853","isNumber":"6982642","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6971853","xplore-issue":"6982642","articleId":"6982654","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":6982655,"authors":[{"name":"Qiang Guo","affiliation":["Department of Information System and Management, National University of Defense Technology"],"firstName":"Qiang","lastName":"Guo","id":"37085359638"},{"name":"Jun Lei","affiliation":["Department of Information System and Management, National University of Defense Technology"],"firstName":"Jun","lastName":"Lei","id":"37085358556"},{"name":"Dan Tu","affiliation":["Department of Information System and Management, National University of Defense Technology"],"firstName":"Dan","lastName":"Tu","id":"37274478100"},{"name":"Guohui Li","affiliation":["Department of Information System and Management, National University of Defense Technology"],"firstName":"Guohui","lastName":"Li","id":"37279728000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-5353-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-5352-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6982655","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":575},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6982655","abstract":"Reading text from natural images is a hard computer vision task.

Convolution Neural Network(CNN) requires fixed dimensional input while number images contain unknown amount of digits. Our method integrats CNN with probabilistic graphical model to deal with the problem. We use hidden Markov model(HMM) to model the image and use CNN to model digits appearance. This method combines the advantages of both the two models and make them fit to the problem. By using this method we can perform the training and recognition procedure both at word level. There is no explicit segmentation operation at all which save lots of labour for sophisticated segmentation algorithm design or finegrained character labeling. Experiments show that deep CNN can dramaticly improve the performance compared with using Gaussian Mixture model as the digit model.

In this paper, we propose a novel image scaling factor estimation method based on normalized energy density and learning to rank, which can not only effectively eliminate the long-known ambiguity between upscaling and downscaling in the analysis of resampling but also accurately estimate the factors of weak scaling, i.e., the scaling factors near 1.

The results of the experiments indicate that our proposed mechanism enormously improved the time performance compared with the hardware resource utilization-based scaling mechanisms.","doi":"10.1109/GRC.2014.6982804","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Conference on Granular Computing (GrC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Conference on Granular Computing (GrC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6968714/6982790/06982804.pdf","startPage":"39","endPage":"44","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GRC.2014.6982804","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6982790","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Service activity-based provision mechanism for cloud computing systems: A case study of cloud patent map system","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6982804","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 Oct. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6982804/","displayDocTitle":"Service activity-based provision mechanism for cloud computing systems: A case study of cloud patent map system","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","accessionNumber":"14826795","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6982804/","conferenceDate":"22-24 Oct. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"15 December 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Service activity-based provision mechanism for cloud computing systems: A case study of cloud patent map system","confLoc":"Noboribetsu, Japan","sourcePdf":"013G256.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.11414S","chronDate":"22-24 Oct. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6968714","isNumber":"6982790","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6968714","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6982790","articleId":"6982804","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":6982805,"authors":[{"name":"Cheng-I Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Central University, Taoyuan, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Cheng-I","lastName":"Chen","id":"37406735800"},{"name":"Yeong-Chin Chen","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science & Information Engineering, Asia University, Taichung, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yeong-Chin","lastName":"Chen","id":"38529246300"},{"name":"Yuan-Chieh Chin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, ChienKuo Technology University, Changhua, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yuan-Chieh","lastName":"Chin","id":"37400521900"},{"name":"Hung-Lu Wang","affiliation":["Electric Inspection Department BSMI Ministry, Taichung, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Hung-Lu","lastName":"Wang","id":"37280094000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-5464-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6982805","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":159},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Harmonic analysis","Power system harmonics","Training","Estimation","Industrial electronics","Synchronization","Neural networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fast Fourier transforms","neural nets","phasor measurement","power engineering computing","signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural network-based phasor measurement unit","power system monitoring","digital signal processing","DSP","fast Fourier transform","FFT"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Global positioning system (GPS)","phasor measurement unit (PMU)","digital signal processor (DSP)","synchronized measurement system","neural network-based method"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6982805","abstract":"The synchronized measurement is important to the applications in power system.

In order to overcome the shortness of ELMs, we try to maintain the geometric structure of the samples distribution in the initial setting of ELM parameters by starting with an auto-encoder ELM, a sufficient condition for such kind auto-encoder ELM to keep the equivalence of topological homology before and after nonlinear mapping is proved by us. For an auto-encoder, in order to do feature abstraction and find the exact manifold in which samples are located, the number of inner layers nodes should be small enough. For this purpose, we prove that the whole samples set can be at least replaced by a small subset which located on the boundary of distribution region. For more, the weights are modified by a ELM approach to make samples of a class move toward this classs hyperplane found by PTSVM. The experimental results on several UCI benchmark data sets show the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Support vector machines","Kernel","Training","Transforms","Shape","Vectors","Manifolds"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["learning (artificial intelligence)","support vector machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hybrid approach","PTSVM","auto-encoder ELM","sample geometric distribution structure","hybrid projection twin support vector machine","extreme learning machine","LS-SVM","PTELM","nonlinear kernel mapping","complex samples distribution region","topological homology","feature abstraction","UCI benchmark data sets"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["projection twin support vector machine (PTSVM)","Extreme Learning Machine (ELM)","nonlinear support vector machine"]}],"doi":"10.1109/GRC.2014.6982815","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Conference on Granular Computing (GrC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Conference on Granular Computing (GrC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6968714/6982790/06982815.pdf","startPage":"100","endPage":"105","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6982790","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GRC.2014.6982815","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A hybrid approach of PTSVM and ELM inspired by samples' geometric distribution structure","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6982815","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A hybrid approach of PTSVM and ELM inspired by samples' geometric distribution structure","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6982815/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6982815/","accessionNumber":"14826799","conferenceDate":"22-24 Oct. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"15 December 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 Oct. 2014","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A hybrid approach of PTSVM and ELM inspired by samples' geometric distribution structure","confLoc":"Noboribetsu, Japan","sourcePdf":"024G226.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062103S","chronDate":"22-24 Oct. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6968714","isNumber":"6982790","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6968714","xplore-issue":"6982790","articleId":"6982815","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6982840,"authors":[{"name":"Junji Nishino","affiliation":["Dept. of Communication Engineering and Informatics, The University of Electro-Communications, Tokyo, JAPAN"],"firstName":"Junji","lastName":"Nishino","id":"37271531000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-5464-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6982840","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":50},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fuzzy sets","Computational modeling","Fuzzy logic","Interpolation","Shape","Manifolds","Numerical models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fuzzy logic","fuzzy set theory","interpolation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Konohen fuzzy","multidimensional fuzzy set","formal expression functional model","multidimensional solution space","interpolation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Fuzzy set","Multi-dimensional","Modeling"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6982840","abstract":"In this paper, Multi-dimensional fuzzy set calculation model is introduced, and the method is called Konohen fuzzy.

This has enriched the applications of cloud computing, ranging from industry, business, to scientific fields. Nowadays cloud computing has become one of the important research issues in the computing and computer network fields. A cloud computing system consists of several independent servers. By way of the virtualization technique, the system manages all of the computing resources efficiently to process each user demand. However, a great number of operating servers will bring considerable power consumption. Efficient resource allocation methods design is one of the important solution approaches to relieve this situation. A resource allocation method will generally allocate each arriving job to proper available computing resources (the virtual machines, VMs) based on the consideration of the related features (such as the job size, the arrival time, etc.) of jobs in the waiting queue. Although the future arrival jobs are unknown, they will significantly affect the resulting performance of the resource allocation. In this paper, we develop an Energy Conserving Resource Allocation Scheme with Prediction (ECRASP) for cloud computing systems. The prediction mechanism can predict the trend of arriving jobs (dense or sparse) in the near future and their related features, so as with help the system to make adequate decisions. Simulation results show that our proposed ECRASP method performs well compared to conventional resource allocation algorithms in the energy conserving comparisons.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A prediction based energy conserving resources allocation scheme for cloud computing","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Conference on Granular Computing (GrC)","doi":"10.1109/GRC.2014.6982857","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Conference on Granular Computing (GrC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6968714/6982790/06982857.pdf","startPage":"320","endPage":"324","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GRC.2014.6982857","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6982790","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6982857","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6982857/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 Oct. 2014","displayDocTitle":"A prediction based energy conserving resources allocation scheme for cloud computing","conferenceDate":"22-24 Oct. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6982857/","dateOfInsertion":"15 December 2014","publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","accessionNumber":"14826771","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A prediction based energy conserving resources allocation scheme for cloud computing","confLoc":"Noboribetsu, Japan","sourcePdf":"066G222.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046813S","chronDate":"22-24 Oct. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6968714","isNumber":"6982790","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6968714","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"6982790","articleId":"6982857","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":6982917,"authors":[{"name":"Jaison Jacob","affiliation":["Dept. of ECE, Rajagiri School of Engineering and Technology, Kochi, India"],"firstName":"Jaison","lastName":"Jacob","id":"37854561600"},{"name":"Babita R.

Presence of primary users (PU) over a specific band has to be monitored periodically in each time slots. Spectrum sensing and data communication have to be completed in each time slot. If we can reduce the time required for spectrum sensing, more data can be transmitted in the specified time slot. If the presence of a PU can be predicted by a CR, throughput of the system can be improved. In this paper we define a simple approach based on Bayesian theorem to predict spectrum occupancy status of PU, from its spectrum occupancy pattern. Its performance is compared with exponential weighted moving average (EWMA) based approach to predict the spectrum occupancy information. A modification to EWMA is also suggested named hybrid approach by including the Bayesian probability within the above approach. Their performance is compared in terms of predicted probability and spectrum decision. Spectrum decision at different parameters of beta distribution is compared. Impact of number of previous data considered for prediction is also explored. Bit error rate of Bayesian approach is found less at certain data distributions. Computational requirement of Bayesian approach is also found relatively less.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 Sept. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6982917/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"14834185","publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","conferenceDate":"10-12 Sept. 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6982917/","dateOfInsertion":"15 December 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Spectrum Prediction in Cognitive Radio Networks: A Bayesian Approach","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spectrum Prediction in Cognitive Radio Networks: A Bayesian Approach","confLoc":"Oxford, UK","sourcePdf":"5073a203.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.094506S","chronDate":"10-12 Sept. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6979378","isNumber":"6982871","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6979378","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6982871","articleId":"6982917","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6982922,"authors":[{"name":"Sajjad Ahmed Ghauri","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering, International Islamic University, Islamabad, Pakistan"],"firstName":"Sajjad Ahmed","lastName":"Ghauri","id":"37950671800"},{"name":"M.

This scheme has simpler decoding algorithm as compared to turbo codes. LDPC adds redundancy to the un-coded input signal to make it more immune to the channel impairments such as noise and fading. The impact of LDPC, (under BPSK, QPSK and QAM modulation schemes) over AWGN, Raleigh faded and Rician faded channels has been investigated and performed several computer based experiments. The procedure of each experiment would be divided into three phases. In the first phase LDPC encoder formed that includes the construction of parity check matrix and selection of modulation scheme for transmission. In the second phase, LDPC codes transmitted over channels, characterized with Additive White Gaussian Noise, Rayleigh and Rician Fading for checking the performance. In the third phase, modulated signal has been demodulated and decoded by using different decoding schemes. The results are reported using bit error rate (BER) versus ratio of bit energy to noise power spectral density (E\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">b</sub>\n/N\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">o</sub>\n) as a performance measure. The simulation models adopted in this research indicate that LDPC performs best on AWGN channel among the three models used. For Rayleigh, it shows worst results, requiring larger SNR values for decline of BER and for Rician research indicates intermediate results between AWGN and Rayleigh channels under different values of K parameter.","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 Eighth International Conference on Next Generation Mobile Apps, Services and Technologies","pdfPath":"/iel7/6979378/6982871/06982922.pdf","startPage":"235","endPage":"240","publicationTitle":"2014 Eighth International Conference on Next Generation Mobile Apps, Services and Technologies","doi":"10.1109/NGMAST.2014.34","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NGMAST.2014.34","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6982871","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6982922","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance Analysis of LDPC Codes on Different Channels","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Parity check codes","Rician channels","Decoding","Rayleigh channels","AWGN channels","Bit error rate"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["AWGN channels","error correction","error statistics","parity check codes","Rayleigh channels","Rician channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low density parity check codes","LDPC codes","error correction","telephone channel identification","modem echo cancellation","Shannon limit","channel impairments","channel noise","channel fading","additive white Gaussian noise","AWGN channel","Rayleigh faded channels","Rician faded channels","parity check matrix","modulation scheme selection","bit error rate","BER","bit energy-noise power spectral density"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["LDPC","Rician","AWGN","Rayleigh Channels"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6982922/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 Sept. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Performance Analysis of LDPC Codes on Different Channels","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6982922/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","accessionNumber":"14834199","dateOfInsertion":"15 December 2014","conferenceDate":"10-12 Sept. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance Analysis of LDPC Codes on Different Channels","confLoc":"Oxford, UK","sourcePdf":"5073a235.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.083258S","chronDate":"10-12 Sept. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6979378","isNumber":"6982871","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6979378","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6982871","articleId":"6982922","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6982925,"authors":[{"name":"Omar Abu-Ella","affiliation":["Faculty of Technology, University of Vaasa, Vaasa, Finland"],"firstName":"Omar","lastName":"Abu-Ella","id":"37085459883"},{"name":"Mohammed Elmusrati","affiliation":["Faculty of Technology, University of Vaasa, Vaasa, Finland"],"firstName":"Mohammed","lastName":"Elmusrati","id":"38520617000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-5073-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-5072-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-2889"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-2897"}],"articleNumber":"6982925","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":359},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Approximation methods","Receivers","Signal to noise ratio","Antennas","Decoding","Transmitters","MIMO"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["5G mobile communication","approximation theory","decoding","group codes","MIMO communication","probability","telecommunication network reliability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["massive MIMO capacity approximation","optimal successive group decoding system","5G wireless technology","massive MIMO OSGD system","closed-form expression","outage probability"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Massive MIMO","large-scale MIMO","capacity","group decoding","interference mitigation","effective capacity","outage probability","next generation networks","4G","5G"]}],"abstract":"Because of the crucial importance of the group decoding techniques to achieve higher data rates, and also since the massive MIMO expected to be a promising key 5G wireless technology, we aim in this paper to consider the problem of formulating the achieved capacity of the massive MIMO optimal successive group decoding (OSGD) system.

Several issues need to be addressed before IoT the way it has been envisioned, can exist. One of the issues will be spectrum scarcity due to high density of IoT devices. Considering the sporadic and multitudinous communication requirements of the IoT devices, an intelligent spectrum sharing mechanism is needed. Such mechanism must consider the heterogeneity of the IoT devices in terms of services offered and communication requirements. In this paper, Complex-Event-Processing (CEP) based Service-Prioritized Opportunistic Communication (SPOC) enabler is proposed that can act as a coordinator for the IoT devices. SPOC has a novel event driven spectrum management architecture for IoT network which facilitates the analysis and processing of spectrum demands in real time. SPOC acquires information about spectrum availability, spectrum demands, device abilities, service priorities and makes spectrum allocation decisions such that service completion rates are improved for all devices while providing reliable QoS to high priority services. Simulations show that compared to linear spectrum allocation schemes, SPOC can achieve high spectrum utilization while processing several thousands of spectrum demand requests. It also reduces waiting time while maintaining the fairness to all users.","doi":"10.1109/NGMAST.2014.41","publicationTitle":"2014 Eighth International Conference on Next Generation Mobile Apps, Services and Technologies","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 Eighth International Conference on Next Generation Mobile Apps, Services and Technologies","pdfPath":"/iel7/6979378/6982871/06982934.pdf","startPage":"313","endPage":"319","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6982871","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NGMAST.2014.41","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6982934","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 Sept. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6982934/","displayDocTitle":"Event Driven Opportunistic Communication Enabler for Smart City","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","accessionNumber":"14827484","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6982934/","dateOfInsertion":"15 December 2014","conferenceDate":"10-12 Sept. 2014","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Event Driven Opportunistic Communication Enabler for Smart City","confLoc":"Oxford, UK","sourcePdf":"5073a313.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.080809S","chronDate":"10-12 Sept. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6979378","isNumber":"6982871","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6979378","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6982871","articleId":"6982934","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6982935,"authors":[{"name":"Daniel Campbell","affiliation":["Department of Computing, Edge Hill University, Ormskirk, UK"],"firstName":"Daniel","lastName":"Campbell","id":"37085481559"},{"name":"Ella G.

Our action selector predicts task-relevant feature and motion sequences, and uses the prediction results to select the robot action. We validate our implemented model on a humanoid robot. The robot generates meaningful behaviour composed out of very simple and few trained motions, and at the same time it compensates for incomplete sensory data such as temporary loss of task-relevant visual features.","doi":"10.1109/DEVLRN.2014.6982969","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DEVLRN.2014.6982969","startPage":"139","endPage":"145","displayPublicationTitle":"4th International Conference on Development and Learning and on Epigenetic Robotics","pdfPath":"/iel7/6971976/6982939/06982969.pdf","publicationTitle":"4th International Conference on Development and Learning and on Epigenetic Robotics","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6982939","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Predictive action selector for generating meaningful robot behaviour from minimum amount of samples","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Oct. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Predictive action selector for generating meaningful robot behaviour from minimum amount of samples","conferenceDate":"13-16 Oct. 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"15 December 2014","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6982969/","accessionNumber":"14827073","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6982969/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Predictive action selector for generating meaningful robot behaviour from minimum amount of samples","confLoc":"Genoa, Italy","sourcePdf":"0039.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049839S","chronDate":"13-16 Oct. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6971976","isNumber":"6982939","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6971976","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6982939","articleId":"6982969","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6982986,"authors":[{"name":"Alain Droniou","affiliation":["Sorbonne Universit\u00e9s UPMC Universit\u00e9 Paris 06, Paris, France","CNRS, Institut des Syst\u00e8mes Intelligents et de Robotique UMR7222, Paris, France"],"firstName":"Alain","lastName":"Droniou","id":"38540300500"},{"name":"Serena Ivaldi","affiliation":["Sorbonne Universit\u00e9s UPMC Universit\u00e9 Paris 06, Paris, France","CNRS, Institut des Syst\u00e8mes Intelligents et de Robotique UMR7222, Paris, France","Intelligent Autonomous Systems Lab, TU Darmstadt, Germany"],"firstName":"Serena","lastName":"Ivaldi","id":"38534379600"},{"name":"Olivier Sigaud","affiliation":["Sorbonne Universit\u00e9s, UPMC Universit\u00e9 Paris 06, ISIR UMR7222, France"],"firstName":"Olivier","lastName":"Sigaud","id":"37571613800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7540-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-9476"}],"articleNumber":"6982986","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":305},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6982986","abstract":"We address the problem of endowing a robot with the capability to learn a repertoire of actions using as little prior knowledge as possible.

These interactions are driven by intrinsic motivations. Recent research on brain is revealing the system of neural structures, pivoting on superior colliculus, underlying trial-and-error learning processes guided by movement-detection, one important element of one specific type of intrinsic motivation mechanism. Here we present a preliminary computational model of such system guiding the acquisition of overt attentional skills. The model is formed by bottom-up attentional components, exploiting the intrinsic properties of the scene, and top-down attentional components, learning under the guidance of movement-based intrinsic motivation. The model is tested with a simple task, inspired by the `gaze-contingency paradigm' proposed in cognitive psychology, where looking some portions of the environment can directly change it. The tests of the model show how its integrated components can learn skills causing relevant changes in the environment while ignoring changes non-contingent to own action. The model also allows the presentation of a wider research agenda directed to build biologically plausible models of the interaction between overt attention control and intrinsic motivations.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Learning where to look with movement-based intrinsic motivations: A bio-inspired model","publicationTitle":"4th International Conference on Development and Learning and on Epigenetic Robotics","doi":"10.1109/DEVLRN.2014.6983024","displayPublicationTitle":"4th International Conference on Development and Learning and on Epigenetic Robotics","pdfPath":"/iel7/6971976/6982939/06983024.pdf","startPage":"461","endPage":"468","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DEVLRN.2014.6983024","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6982939","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6983024","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6983024/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Oct. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Learning where to look with movement-based intrinsic motivations: A bio-inspired model","conferenceDate":"13-16 Oct. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6983024/","dateOfInsertion":"15 December 2014","publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","accessionNumber":"14827113","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Learning where to look with movement-based intrinsic motivations: A bio-inspired model","confLoc":"Genoa, Italy","sourcePdf":"0120.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.085322S","chronDate":"13-16 Oct. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6971976","isNumber":"6982939","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6971976","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6982939","articleId":"6983024","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":6983026,"authors":[{"name":"Emre Ugur","affiliation":["Intelligent and Interactive Systems, University of Innsbruck"],"firstName":"Emre","lastName":"Ugur","id":"37947264700"},{"name":"Sandor Szedmak","affiliation":["Intelligent and Interactive Systems, University of Innsbruck"],"firstName":"Sandor","lastName":"Szedmak","id":"37393653700"},{"name":"Justus Piater","affiliation":["Intelligent and Interactive Systems, University of Innsbruck"],"firstName":"Justus","lastName":"Piater","id":"37372950100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7540-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-9476"}],"articleNumber":"6983026","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":13,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":185},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Shape","Robot sensing systems","Vectors","Grippers","Robot kinematics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["control engineering computing","human-robot interaction","learning (artificial intelligence)","robots","statistical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bootstrapping paired-object affordance learning","learned single-affordance features","complex affordance learning","prelearned basic-affordances","complex affordance predictor","higher-level affordance feature","multiobject affordances","artificial interaction database","object category","poke action","stack action","object-robot-environment dynamics","shape descriptors","distance measure","learned single-object affordance"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6983026","doi":"10.1109/DEVLRN.2014.6983026","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DEVLRN.2014.6983026","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6982939","publicationTitle":"4th International Conference on Development and Learning and on Epigenetic Robotics","displayPublicationTitle":"4th International Conference on Development and Learning and on Epigenetic Robotics","pdfPath":"/iel7/6971976/6982939/06983026.pdf","startPage":"476","endPage":"481","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bootstrapping paired-object affordance learning with learned single-affordance features","abstract":"The aim of this paper is to propose a system where complex affordance learning is bootstrapped through using pre-learned basic-affordances as additional inputs of the complex affordance predictors or as cues in selecting the next objects to explore during learning. In the first stage, the robot learns affordances in the form of developing classifiers that predict effect categories given object features for different discrete actions applicable to single objects. These predictions are later added to robot's feature set as higher-level affordance features. In the second stage, the robot learns more complex multi-object affordances using object and affordance features. We first applied our idea in an artificial interaction database which includes discrete actions, several manually coded object categories, and actions effects. Finally, we validated our bootstrapping approach in a real robot with poke and stack actions. We expected to obtain higher performance with affordance-features especially in small training datasets as the object-robot-environment dynamics should have already been partially learned and encoded in affordances. The experiment results showed that complex affordance learning significantly speeds up with predictors that are bootstrapped with affordance-features compared to predictors that use low-level features such as shape descriptors. We also showed that by actively selecting the next objects and by increasing the diversity of the training set using a distance measure based on learned single-object affordances, the effect of bootstrapping can be further increased.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6983026/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Oct. 2014","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"13-16 Oct. 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6983026/","dateOfInsertion":"15 December 2014","publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","accessionNumber":"14827137","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Bootstrapping paired-object affordance learning with learned single-affordance features","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bootstrapping paired-object affordance learning with learned single-affordance features","confLoc":"Genoa, Italy","sourcePdf":"0119.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070273S","chronDate":"13-16 Oct. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6971976","isNumber":"6982939","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6971976","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"6982939","articleId":"6983026","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6983036,"authors":[{"name":"Tao Jiang","affiliation":["University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Tao","lastName":"Jiang","id":"37060926100"},{"name":"Qianlong Zhang","affiliation":["SKL Computer Architecture, CAS, Beijine, China"],"firstName":"Qianlong","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37085503497"},{"name":"Rui Hou","affiliation":["SKL Computer Architecture, CAS, Beijine, China"],"firstName":"Rui","lastName":"Hou","id":"37061027100"},{"name":"Lin Chai","affiliation":["SKL Computer Architecture, CAS, Beijine, China"],"firstName":"Lin","lastName":"Chai","id":"37085504928"},{"name":"Sally A.

For instance, the Apache Spark framework stores intermediate results in memory to deliver good performance on iterative machine learning and interactive data analysis tasks. To the best of our knowledge, though, little work has been done to understand Spark's architectural and microarchitectural behaviors. Furthermore, although conventional commodity processors have been well optimized for traditional desktops and HPC, their effectiveness for Spark workloads remains to be studied. To shed some light on the effectiveness of conventional generalpurpose processors on Spark workloads, we study their behavior in comparison to those of Hadoop, CloudSuite, SPEC CPU2006, TPC-C, and DesktopCloud. We evaluate the benchmarks on a 17-node Xeon cluster. Our performance results reveal that Spark workloads have significantly different characteristics from Hadoop and traditional HPC benchmarks. At the system level, Spark workloads have good memory bandwidth utilization (up to 50%), stable memory accesses, and high disk IO request frequency (200 per second). At the microarchitectural level, the cache and TLB are effective for Spark workloads, but the L2 cache miss rate is high. We hope this work yields insights for chip and datacenter system designers.","doi":"10.1109/IISWC.2014.6983036","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6983029","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IISWC.2014.6983036","endPage":"30","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Symposium on Workload Characterization (IISWC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Symposium on Workload Characterization (IISWC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6966889/6983029/06983036.pdf","startPage":"22","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Understanding the behavior of in-memory computing workloads","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 Oct. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6983036/","displayDocTitle":"Understanding the behavior of in-memory computing workloads","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"26-28 Oct. 2014","accessionNumber":"14826729","dateOfInsertion":"15 December 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6983036/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Understanding the behavior of in-memory computing workloads","confLoc":"Raleigh, NC, USA","sourcePdf":"008Paper47Jiang3386513.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.120089S","chronDate":"26-28 Oct. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6966889","isNumber":"6983029","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6966889","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"6983029","articleId":"6983036","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6983037,"authors":[{"name":"Svilen Kanev","firstName":"Svilen","lastName":"Kanev","id":"37594367300"},{"name":"Kim Hazelwood","affiliation":["Google, Inc."],"firstName":"Kim","lastName":"Hazelwood","id":"37085542599"},{"name":"Gu-Yeon Wei","affiliation":["Harvard University"],"firstName":"Gu-Yeon","lastName":"Wei","id":"37085451336"},{"name":"David Brooks","firstName":"David","lastName":"Brooks","id":"37085539490"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6454-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6452-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6983037","dbTime":"16 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":36,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":577},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Servers","Benchmark testing","Google","Hardware","Production","Kernel"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer centres","power aware computing","quality of service"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power management","warehouse-scale applications","data center computing","energy-efficiency","servers","power reduction","server designs","energy-proportional computing","quality of service","QoS","Google","sleep selection algorithms","tail latency degradation","Web search","dynamic voltage and frequency scaling","DVFS","workload-per-workload basis"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6983037","doi":"10.1109/IISWC.2014.6983037","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Symposium on Workload Characterization (IISWC)","abstract":"The growth in datacenter computing has increased the importance of energy-efficiency in servers. Techniques to reduce power have brought server designs close to achieving energy-proportional computing. However, they stress the inherent tradeoff between aggressive power management and quality of service (QoS) - the dominant metric of performance in datacenters. In this paper, we characterize this tradeoff for 15 benchmarks representing workloads from Google's datacenters. We show that 9 of these benchmarks often toggle their cores between short bursts of activity and sleep. In doing so, they stress sleep selection algorithms and can cause tail latency degradation or missed potential for power savings of up to 10% on important workloads like web search. However, improving sleep selection alone is not sufficient for large efficiency gains on current server hardware. To guide the direction needed for such large gains, we profile datacenter applications for susceptibility to dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS). We find the largest potential in DVFS which is cognizant of latency/power tradeoffs on a workload-per-workload basis.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IISWC.2014.6983037","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6983029","startPage":"31","endPage":"40","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Symposium on Workload Characterization (IISWC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6966889/6983029/06983037.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Tradeoffs between power management and tail latency in warehouse-scale applications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6983037/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 Oct. 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6983037/","displayDocTitle":"Tradeoffs between power management and tail latency in warehouse-scale applications","conferenceDate":"26-28 Oct. 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","accessionNumber":"14826725","dateOfInsertion":"15 December 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Tradeoffs between power management and tail latency in warehouse-scale applications","confLoc":"Raleigh, NC, USA","sourcePdf":"009TradeoffsbetweenKanev3375967.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.105643S","chronDate":"26-28 Oct. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6966889","isNumber":"6983029","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6966889","citationCount":"36","xplore-issue":"6983029","articleId":"6983037","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6983043,"authors":[{"name":"Shelby Thomas","affiliation":["University of California, San Diego"],"firstName":"Shelby","lastName":"Thomas","id":"37085495777"},{"name":"Chetan Gohkale","affiliation":["University of California, San Diego"],"firstName":"Chetan","lastName":"Gohkale","id":"37085497407"},{"name":"Enrico Tanuwidjaja","affiliation":["University of California, San Diego"],"firstName":"Enrico","lastName":"Tanuwidjaja","id":"37085482447"},{"name":"Tony Chong","affiliation":["University of California, San Diego"],"firstName":"Tony","lastName":"Chong","id":"37085488823"},{"name":"David Lau","affiliation":["University of California, San Diego"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Lau","id":"37085498509"},{"name":"Saturnino Garcia","affiliation":["University of San Diego","University of California, San Diego"],"firstName":"Saturnino","lastName":"Garcia","id":"37673191900"},{"name":"Michael Bedford Taylor","affiliation":["University of California, San Diego"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Bedford Taylor","id":"37273314000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6454-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6452-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6983043","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":33,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":343},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Benchmark testing","Computer vision","Machine learning algorithms","Algorithm design and analysis","Image resolution","Data processing","Classification algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["brain","computer vision","learning (artificial intelligence)","natural language processing","neurophysiology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["C language","computer vision","machine learning","man-made algorithms","neuron","data processing algorithms","cerebral cortex","human neural processing function","human nervous system","information processing capabilities","synthetic brain benchmark suite","CortexSuite"]}],"abstract":"These days, many traditional end-user applications are said to \u201crun fast enough\u201d on existing machines, so the search continues for novel applications that can leverage the new capabilities of our evolving hardware. Foremost of these potential applications are those that are clustered around information processing capabilities that humans have today but are lacking in computers. The fact that brains can perform these computations serves as an existence proof that these applications are realizable. At the same time, we often discover that the human nervous system, with its 80 billion neurons, on some metrics, is more powerful and energy-efficient than today's machines. Both of these aspects make this class of applications a desirable target for an architectural benchmark suite, because there is evidence that these applications are both useful and computationally challenging. This paper details CortexSuite, a Synthetic Brain Benchmark Suite, which seeks to capture this workload. We classify and identify benchmarks within CortexSuite by analogy to the human neural processing function. We use the major lobes of the cerebral cortex as a model for the organization and classification of data processing algorithms. To be clear, our goal is not to emulate the brain at the level of the neuron, but rather to collect together synthetic, man-made algorithms that have similar function and have met with success in the real world. We consulted six world-class machine learning and computer vision researchers, who collectively hold 83,091 citations across their distinct subareas, asking them to identify newly emerging computationally-intensive algorithms or applications that are going to have a large impact over the next ten years. This is coupled with datasets that reflect the philosophy of practical use algorithms and are coded in \u201cclean C\u201d so as to make them accessible, analyzable, and usable for parallel and approximate compiler and architecture researchers alike.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"CortexSuite: A synthetic brain benchmark suite","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Symposium on Workload Characterization (IISWC)","doi":"10.1109/IISWC.2014.6983043","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Symposium on Workload Characterization (IISWC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6966889/6983029/06983043.pdf","startPage":"76","endPage":"79","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IISWC.2014.6983043","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6983029","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6983043","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6983043/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 Oct. 2014","displayDocTitle":"CortexSuite: A synthetic brain benchmark suite","conferenceDate":"26-28 Oct. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6983043/","dateOfInsertion":"15 December 2014","publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","accessionNumber":"14833588","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"CortexSuite: A synthetic brain benchmark suite","confLoc":"Raleigh, NC, USA","sourcePdf":"01692Thomasv043376501.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051122S","chronDate":"26-28 Oct. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6966889","isNumber":"6983029","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6966889","citationCount":"33","xplore-issue":"6983029","articleId":"6983043","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":6983050,"authors":[{"name":"Brandon Reagen","affiliation":["Harvard University, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Brandon","lastName":"Reagen","id":"37076157700"},{"name":"Robert Adolf","affiliation":["Harvard University, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Robert","lastName":"Adolf","id":"38581218600"},{"name":"Yakun Sophia Shao","affiliation":["Harvard University, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Yakun Sophia","lastName":"Shao","id":"37070947100"},{"name":"Gu-Yeon Wei","affiliation":["Harvard University, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Gu-Yeon","lastName":"Wei","id":"37281335300"},{"name":"David Brooks","affiliation":["Harvard University, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Brooks","id":"37279380700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6454-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6452-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6983050","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":93,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1471},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Benchmark testing","Kernel","Hardware","Algorithm design and analysis","Sparse matrices","Acceleration","Communities"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["benchmark testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MachSuite","benchmarks","accelerator design","customized architectures","accelerator-related architecture","workload selection","high-level synthesis tools","accelerator-centric architectures","program behaviors"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6983050","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Symposium on Workload Characterization (IISWC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6966889/6983029/06983050.pdf","startPage":"110","endPage":"119","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IISWC.2014.6983050","doi":"10.1109/IISWC.2014.6983050","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6983029","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Symposium on Workload Characterization (IISWC)","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MachSuite: Benchmarks for accelerator design and customized architectures","abstract":"Recent high-level synthesis and accelerator-related architecture papers show a great disparity in workload selection.

Further, emerging heterogeneous CPU-GPU processors promise to offer tighter coupling between core types via a unified virtual address space and cache coherence. To adequately address the potential opportunities and pitfalls that may arise from this tighter coupling, it is important to have a deep understanding of application- and memory-level demands from both CPU and GPU cores. This paper presents a detailed comparison of memory access behavior for parallel applications executing on each core type in tightly-controlled heterogeneous CPU-GPU processor simulation. This characterization indicates that applications are typically designed with similar algorithmic structures for CPU and GPU cores, and each core type's memory access path has a similar locality filtering role. However, the different core and cache microarchitectures expose substantially different memory-level parallelism (MLP), which results in different instantaneous memory access rates and sensitivity to memory hierarchy architecture.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6983054/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 Oct. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"15 December 2014","accessionNumber":"14826723","htmlLink":"/document/6983054/","conferenceDate":"26-28 Oct. 2014","displayDocTitle":"A comparative analysis of microarchitecture effects on CPU and GPU memory system behavior","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A comparative analysis of microarchitecture effects on CPU and GPU memory system behavior","confLoc":"Raleigh, NC, USA","sourcePdf":"027AComparativeHestness3375801.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072779S","chronDate":"26-28 Oct. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6966889","isNumber":"6983029","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6966889","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"6983029","articleId":"6983054","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6983056,"authors":[{"name":"Dhinakaran Pandiyan","affiliation":["School of Computing, Arizona State University, Tempe, Arizona"],"firstName":"Dhinakaran","lastName":"Pandiyan","id":"37085372292"},{"name":"Carole-Jean Wu","affiliation":["School of Computing, Arizona State University, Tempe, Arizona"],"firstName":"Carole-Jean","lastName":"Wu","id":"37085392155"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6454-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6452-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6983056","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":28,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":773},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6983056","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Smart phones","Registers","Benchmark testing","Energy consumption","Energy measurement","Power measurement","Mobile communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mobile computing","power aware computing","smart phones","system-on-chip"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy cost quantification","smart phone workloads","mobile platforms","portable computing systems","energy consumption","memory system","data movement instruction","arithmetic instruction","distributive computing","SoC","commercially-available smart phone device","microbenchmarks","data movement patterns","memory hierarchy","hardware performance counters","data movement energy","energy efficiency"]}],"abstract":"In portable computing systems like smartphones, energy is generally a key but limited resource where application cores have been proven to consume a significant part of it. To understand the characteristics of the energy consumption, in this paper, we focus our attention on the portion of energy that is spent to move data to the application core's internal registers from the memory system. The primary motivation for this focus comes from the relatively higher energy cost associated with a data movement instruction compared to that of an arithmetic instruction. Another important factor is the distributive computing nature among different units in a SoC which leads to a higher data movement to/from the application cores. We perform a detailed investigation to quantify the impact of data movement on overall energy consumption of a popular, commercially-available smart phone device. To aid this study, we design micro-benchmarks that generate desired data movement patterns between different levels of the memory hierarchy and measure the instantaneous power consumed by the device when running these micro-benchmarks. We extensively make use of hardware performance counters to validate the micro-benchmarks and to characterize the energy consumed in moving data. We take a step further to utilize this calculated energy cost of data movement to characterize the portion of energy that an application spends in moving data for a wide range of popular smart phone workloads. We find that a considerable amount of total device energy is spent in data movement (an average of 35% of the total device energy). Our results also indicate a relatively high stalled cycle energy consumption (an average of 23.5%) for current smart phones. To our knowledge, this is the first study that quantifies the amount of data movement energy for emerging smart phone applications running on a recent, commercial smart phone device. We hope this characterization study and the insights developed in the paper can inspire innovative designs in smart phone architectures with improved performance and energy efficiency.","doi":"10.1109/IISWC.2014.6983056","startPage":"171","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Symposium on Workload Characterization (IISWC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Symposium on Workload Characterization (IISWC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6966889/6983029/06983056.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IISWC.2014.6983056","endPage":"180","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6983029","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Quantifying the energy cost of data movement for emerging smart phone workloads on mobile platforms","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6983056/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 Oct. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Quantifying the energy cost of data movement for emerging smart phone workloads on mobile platforms","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6983056/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"14826738","conferenceDate":"26-28 Oct. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"15 December 2014","publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Quantifying the energy cost of data movement for emerging smart phone workloads on mobile platforms","confLoc":"Raleigh, NC, USA","sourcePdf":"029Quantifyingthepandiyan3375861.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045832S","chronDate":"26-28 Oct. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6966889","isNumber":"6983029","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6966889","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"6983029","articleId":"6983056","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":6983059,"authors":[{"name":"Ahmad Yasin","affiliation":["University of Haifa","Intel Corporation"],"firstName":"Ahmad","lastName":"Yasin","id":"37085447690"},{"name":"Yosi Ben-Asher","affiliation":["University of Haifa"],"firstName":"Yosi","lastName":"Ben-Asher","id":"37282668700"},{"name":"Avi Mendelson","affiliation":["Technion"],"firstName":"Avi","lastName":"Mendelson","id":"37282322100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6454-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6452-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6983059","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":31,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1129},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6983059","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Measurement","Optimization","Computer architecture","Instruction sets","Data analysis","Runtime"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Big Data","cloud computing","computer centres","data analysis","table lookup"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["deep-dive analysis","CloudSuite","digital data","massively-parallel system","special orchestration layer","scale-out workload","datacenter","big data analytics workload","BDA workload","cloud server","single workload-platform","CPU bottleneck","comprehensive threefold analysis method","system parameter","runtime code","proof-by-optimization approach","power reduction","Hash index lookup","key performance limiter","JVM selection","unoptimized application code","suboptimal microarchitecture area","programming styles","CPU parallelization feature"]}],"abstract":"Exponential growth of digital data has introduced massively-parallel systems, special orchestration layers, and new scale-out applications. While recent works suggest characteristics of scale-out workloads are different from those of traditional ones, their root causes are not understood. Such understanding is extremely important to improve efficiency; even a 1% performance gain for a core can have a large impact on the datacenter as a whole. This paper studies the characteristics of a Big Data Analytics (BDA) workload on a modern cloud server. It is intentionally focused on a single workload-platform in order to enable deep-dive analysis that aims to understand the root causes of the CPU bottlenecks which this paper identify. We choose the Data Analytics benchmark from CloudSuite [1] as a representative of a growing family of important applications. This paper describes a customization of a comprehensive threefold analysis method. The method consists of a System level, where sensitivity to system parameters is examined, as well as Application and Architectural levels; where bottlenecks are attributed back to the application and runtime codes, respectively. The paper also adopts a proof-by-optimization approach to prove bottlenecks' validity. Overall, 65% net speedup is measured with significant power reduction. The paper reveals that BDA workloads suffer from overheads related to managing the data rather than accessing the data. For example, Hash index lookup is found to be a key performance limiter. Inefficiencies leading to such unexpected behavior are demonstrated, including JVM selection and heavily unoptimized application code, both of which have a big impact. Suboptimal microarchitecture areas are demonstrated too, in addition to programming styles that limit exploitation of upcoming JVM and CPU parallelization features.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6983029","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IISWC.2014.6983059","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Symposium on Workload Characterization (IISWC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Symposium on Workload Characterization (IISWC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6966889/6983029/06983059.pdf","startPage":"202","endPage":"211","doi":"10.1109/IISWC.2014.6983059","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Deep-dive analysis of the data analytics workload in CloudSuite","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 Oct. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Deep-dive analysis of the data analytics workload in CloudSuite","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"26-28 Oct. 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6983059/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","accessionNumber":"14826744","dateOfInsertion":"15 December 2014","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6983059/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Deep-dive analysis of the data analytics workload in CloudSuite","confLoc":"Raleigh, NC, USA","sourcePdf":"032AnalyticsAnalysisYasin3363213.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073568S","chronDate":"26-28 Oct. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6966889","isNumber":"6983029","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6966889","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"6983029","articleId":"6983059","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6983093,"authors":[{"name":"Hela Chamkhia","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, Qatar University, Doha, Qatar"],"firstName":"Hela","lastName":"Chamkhia","id":"38232698000"},{"name":"Mazen O.

We quantify in this paper the performance of a new spectrum sharing scheme using Markov chains modeling, and which attempt to enhance the secondary system performances while canceling the cross-tier interferences.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6983093/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 Oct. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"15 December 2014","accessionNumber":"14833424","htmlLink":"/document/6983093/","conferenceDate":"22-24 Oct. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Capacity enhancement in cognitive radio wireless network with dynamic spectrum access","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Capacity enhancement in cognitive radio wireless network with dynamic spectrum access","confLoc":"Busan, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"S152.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062378S","chronDate":"22-24 Oct. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6966882","isNumber":"6983064","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6966882","xplore-issue":"6983064","articleId":"6983093","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":6983105,"authors":[{"name":"Ramesh Babu Battula","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, MNIT, Jaipur, INDIA"],"firstName":"Ramesh Babu","lastName":"Battula","id":"37085371566"},{"name":"Dinesh Gopalani","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, MNIT, Jaipur, INDIA"],"firstName":"Dinesh","lastName":"Gopalani","id":"37402646500"},{"name":"Manoj Singh Gaur","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, MNIT, Jaipur, INDIA"],"firstName":"Manoj Singh","lastName":"Gaur","id":"37085378242"},{"name":"Jagadeesh Kakarla","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, NIT, Rourkela, INDIA"],"firstName":"Jagadeesh","lastName":"Kakarla","id":"37085372768"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6786-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2162-1233"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2162-1241"}],"articleNumber":"6983105","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":246},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Transmitters","Media Access Protocol","Cognitive radio","Interference","Time-frequency analysis","Throughput"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["access protocols","cognitive radio","radio spectrum management","wireless mesh networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["spectrum holes","network throughput","NS2 simulation","data channel operation","sensing","control channel operation","intelligent adaptable devices","TMAC","cognitive radio wireless mesh network","token based MAC protocol"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cognitive radio","Wireless Mesh Networks","Channel selection","Token","Medium Access Control"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6983105","doi":"10.1109/ICTC.2014.6983105","publicationTitle":"2014 International Conference on Information and Communication Technology Convergence (ICTC)","abstract":"Emerging wireless applications has made the issue of spectrum scarcity inevitable.

The downlink MU-MIMO system is constructed as a transmitter with 6 antennas and receivers with 2 antennas, and the maximum number of users(receivers) is 3. In computer simulation, MU-MIMO transmission system can be realized by using the BD (Block Diagonalization) algorithm, and each user can receive signals without any signal interferences between the other users. BER (Bit Error Rate) performance and channel capacity according to modulation schemes and the number of streams are simulated in spatially uncorrelated and correlated multipath fading environment. In field experiment, downlink throughput on UDP layer are measured on the mobile WiMAX system with Matrix A mode and Matrix B mode developed at Azumino City in Japan. Compared with the simulated and experimented results, the measured maximum throughput performance in downlink has almost the same performance with the simulated throughput. It is confirmed that the experimental mobile WiMAX system for MU-MIMO transmission is actually performed for increasing the total channel capacity of the system.","doi":"10.1109/ICTC.2014.6983129","publicationTitle":"2014 International Conference on Information and Communication Technology Convergence (ICTC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 International Conference on Information and Communication Technology Convergence (ICTC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6966882/6983064/06983129.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICTC.2014.6983129","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6983064","startPage":"253","endPage":"258","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance evaluation of downlink MU-MIMO transmission based on mobile WiMAX system in computer simulations and field experiments","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6983129","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Performance evaluation of downlink MU-MIMO transmission based on mobile WiMAX system in computer simulations and field experiments","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 Oct. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6983129/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"22-24 Oct. 2014","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","accessionNumber":"14833492","dateOfInsertion":"15 December 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6983129/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance evaluation of downlink MU-MIMO transmission based on mobile WiMAX system in computer simulations and field experiments","confLoc":"Busan, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"S313.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.080089S","chronDate":"22-24 Oct. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6966882","isNumber":"6983064","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6966882","xplore-issue":"6983064","articleId":"6983129","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":6983135,"authors":[{"name":"Sun-Nyoung Hwang","affiliation":["Department of Parmacology, The Catholic University of Korea (CUK), Seoul, Republic of Korea"],"firstName":"Sun-Nyoung","lastName":"Hwang","id":"37085576815"},{"name":"Ryangsoo Kim","affiliation":["School of Information and Communications, Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology, Gwangju, Republic of Korea"],"firstName":"Ryangsoo","lastName":"Kim","id":"37085579524"},{"name":"Hyuk Lim","affiliation":["School of Information and Communications, Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology, Gwangju, Republic of Korea"],"firstName":"Hyuk","lastName":"Lim","id":"37288105600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6786-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2162-1233"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2162-1241"}],"articleNumber":"6983135","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":122},"abstract":"Wireless capsule endoscopy (WCE) has emerged as a convenient diagnostic method for human gastrointestinal (GI) diseases owing to its non-invasiveness and capability to explore the entire GI tract. It also has a large potential to play a therapeutic role owing to the rapid advances in micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) technology. For accurate diagnosis and treatment of pathological conditions, a low-cost and accurate tracking system for WCE is highly required. Currently, the received signal strength (RSS)-based techniques are widely used for WCE localization because of its advantages in terms of non-specificity and low-cost implementation. However, these RSS-based techniques are quite susceptible to RSS measurement noise with random characteristics. We develop the Bayesian graphical model (BGM) for the RSS-based tracking system and then use Gibbs sampling to stochastically infer the location of the capsule endoscope. Through the results of the simulation experiment, we demonstrate the validity of the proposed methodology for WCE-tracking system.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bayesian inference-based tracking for

the arriving time difference on LTE-Advanced uplink MU-MIMO in Distributed Antenna System (DAS) environment, we suggest RRH selection and transmission time adjustment method for obtaining the receiving performance gain. DAS which is one of CoMP technologies has known as the most efficient technology for improving spectral efficiency and cell-edge user throughput. However, when uplink MU-MIMO is carried out in the DAS environment, the arriving time difference is inevitable owing to geographical distribution of RRHs location. The arriving time difference of the multiple UEs has decisive effect on system performance. Therefore, in this paper, we propose RRH selection and UE transmission time adjustment method for minimizing the arriving time difference. Through link-level simulation, we show the impact of the arriving time difference on LTE-Advanced uplink MU-MIMO in DAS environment and compare the performance of the suggested method with that of the conventional method.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"RRH selection and UE transmission time adjustment for LTE-advanced uplink MU-MIMO in Distributed Antenna System environment","publicationTitle":"2014 International Conference on Information and Communication Technology Convergence (ICTC)","doi":"10.1109/ICTC.2014.6983142","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 International Conference on Information and Communication Technology Convergence (ICTC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6966882/6983064/06983142.pdf","startPage":"301","endPage":"305","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICTC.2014.6983142","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6983064","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6983142","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6983142/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 Oct. 2014","displayDocTitle":"RRH selection and UE transmission time adjustment for LTE-advanced uplink MU-MIMO in Distributed Antenna System environment","conferenceDate":"22-24 Oct. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6983142/","dateOfInsertion":"15 December 2014","publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","accessionNumber":"14833434","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"RRH selection and UE transmission time adjustment for LTE-advanced uplink MU-MIMO in Distributed Antenna System environment","confLoc":"Busan, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"S341.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074165S","chronDate":"22-24 Oct. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6966882","isNumber":"6983064","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6966882","xplore-issue":"6983064","articleId":"6983142","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":6983144,"authors":[{"name":"Wei-Lun Lin","affiliation":["Department of Communications Engineering, Feng Chia University, Taichung, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Wei-Lun","lastName":"Lin","id":"37085391987"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6786-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2162-1233"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2162-1241"}],"articleNumber":"6983144","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":25},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiaccess communication","Bandwidth","Modulation","Redundancy","Spread spectrum communication","Receivers","Mathematical model"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","orthogonal codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DS-CDMA system","direct-sequence code division multiple access system","Nyquist transmission rate","orthogonal spreading code"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Bandlimited direct-sequence code division multiple access","pulse shaping technique"]}],"abstract":"A generalized modified minimum-bandwidth direct-sequence code division multiple access system is proposed to approach Nyquist transmission rate without sacrificing error performance or user capacity.

Recently, a novel approach to use stochastic geometry for analyzing the communication performance over random wireless network has gained popularity. These approach treat the location of base stations (BSs) as homogeneous Poisson point process (PPP) by assuming that the nodes are uniformly distributed in space. However, due to geographical factors, it may be the case for mobile users to cluster around highly populated cities and the PPP assumption does not provide an accurate model for the interference in these conditions. This motivates us to find better ways to characterize the aggregate interference. To this end, we consider K-tier HetNets where each tier may differ in terms of transmit power, node densities, link reliabilities and the transmitting nodes are clustered following a Poisson cluster process (PCP). We evaluate the outage probability and the average achievable rate and derive tight bounds that simplify the numerical computation. The main advantage of this approach is that our results provide complete theoretical tools to model interference over an urban and rural area whether it is clustered or not.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICTC.2014.6983146","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6983064","startPage":"319","endPage":"324","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 International Conference on Information and Communication Technology Convergence (ICTC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6966882/6983064/06983146.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of heterogeneous cellular networks interference with biased cell association using Poisson cluster processes","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6983146/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 Oct. 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6983146/","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of heterogeneous cellular networks interference with biased cell association using Poisson cluster processes","conferenceDate":"22-24 Oct. 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","accessionNumber":"14833409","dateOfInsertion":"15 December 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of heterogeneous cellular networks interference with biased cell association using Poisson cluster processes","confLoc":"Busan, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"S345.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055241S","chronDate":"22-24 Oct. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6966882","isNumber":"6983064","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6966882","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6983064","articleId":"6983146","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6983148,"authors":[{"name":"Jae-Wook Lee","affiliation":["Graduate School of Information Technology & Telecommunication, Inha University, Incheon, Korea"],"firstName":"Jae-Wook","lastName":"Lee","id":"37085459275"},{"name":"Sang-Jo Yoo","affiliation":["Graduate School of Information Technology & Telecommunication, Inha University, Incheon, Korea"],"firstName":"Sang-Jo","lastName":"Yoo","id":"37403379000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6786-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2162-1233"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2162-1241"}],"articleNumber":"6983148","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":95},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Handover","Probabilistic logic","Macrocell networks","Capacity planning","Ultrafast electronics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["femtocellular radio","mobility management (mobile radio)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["femtocell network","probabilistic handover decision","cellular network","macrocell","mobile station","available data capacity"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Femtocell","Handover Decision","Probabilistic Path","Data Capacity"]}],"abstract":"Femtocell is considered as a technology to improve the performance of a cellular network at a relatively low cost.

On the other hand, it is crucial that CR users efficiently exchange data with each other before the appearance of licensed primary user (PU). To design a robust routing scheme for mobile CR ad hoc networks (CRANs), the constraints on residual energy of each CR user, reliability, and the protection of PUs must additionally be taken into consideration. Moreover, multipath routing has great potential for improving the end-to-end performance of ad hoc networks. Considering all these facts, in this paper, we propose a spectrum and energy aware multipath routing (SEMR) scheme for mobile CRANs to ensure the robustness and to improve the throughput. The proposed routing scheme involves energy efficient multipath route selection and spectrum allocation jointly. We present experimental results, which show that the proposed multipath mechanism outperforms a number of existing mechanisms in the environment of mobile CRANs.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICTC.2014.6983150","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6983064","startPage":"341","endPage":"346","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 International Conference on Information and Communication Technology Convergence (ICTC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6966882/6983064/06983150.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spectrum and energy aware multipath routing for cognitive radio ad hoc networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6983150/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 Oct. 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6983150/","displayDocTitle":"Spectrum and energy aware multipath routing for cognitive radio ad hoc networks","conferenceDate":"22-24 Oct. 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","accessionNumber":"14833452","dateOfInsertion":"15 December 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spectrum and energy aware multipath routing for cognitive radio ad hoc networks","confLoc":"Busan, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"S354.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065118S","chronDate":"22-24 Oct. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6966882","isNumber":"6983064","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6966882","xplore-issue":"6983064","articleId":"6983150","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":6983158,"authors":[{"name":"Shijie Sun","affiliation":["School of Electronic Engineering, Soongsil University, Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Shijie","lastName":"Sun","id":"37085340695"},{"name":"Yoan Shin","affiliation":["School of Electronic Engineering, Soongsil University, Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Yoan","lastName":"Shin","id":"37279496500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6786-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2162-1233"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2162-1241"}],"articleNumber":"6983158","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":520},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6983158","abstract":"D2D (Device-to-Device) communication is one of the promising technologies in the LTE (Long-Term Evolution)-Advanced communication network From a system perspective, this technology can increase frequency efficiency of the whole macro cell. From the user perspective, a D2D pair which shares the same frequency resource of CUE (Cellular User Equipment), can cause interference with the CUE in the downlink Thus, reducing underlying interference for the cellular users is important in D2D communication. In this paper, an interference avoidance and resource allocation scheme based on PSO (Particle Swarm Optimization) is proposed to maximize the system spectral efficiency by allowing more than one D2D pair to share the same frequency resource with one CUE. A mode selection scheme is also proposed after the mapping process of the PSO. The simulation results show that cellular service and system performance can be effectively guaranteed by using the proposed scheme.","doi":"10.1109/ICTC.2014.6983158","startPage":"371","endPage":"376","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 International Conference on Information and Communication Technology Convergence (ICTC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6966882/6983064/06983158.pdf","publicationTitle":"2014 International Conference on Information and Communication Technology Convergence (ICTC)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICTC.2014.6983158","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6983064","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Resource allocation for D2D communication using Particle Swarm Optimization in LTE networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference","Resource management","OFDM","Base stations","Particle swarm optimization","Radio spectrum management","Mobile handsets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Long Term Evolution","particle swarm optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mode selection scheme","PSO","cellular user equipment","CUE","long-term evolution","device-to-device communication","LTE networks","particle swarm optimization","D2D communication","resource allocation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["device-to-device","interference","resource allocation","particle swarm optimization","mode selection"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6983158/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 Oct. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Resource allocation for D2D communication using Particle Swarm Optimization in LTE networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6983158/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"15 December 2014","conferenceDate":"22-24 Oct. 2014","accessionNumber":"14833570","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Resource allocation for D2D communication using Particle Swarm Optimization in LTE networks","confLoc":"Busan, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"S423.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058717S","chronDate":"22-24 Oct. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6966882","isNumber":"6983064","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6966882","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6983064","articleId":"6983158","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-26"},{"_id":6983166,"authors":[{"name":"Seong Hee Lee","affiliation":["Div. of Electronics and Electrical Eng., Dongguk University, Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Seong Hee","lastName":"Lee","id":"37085547186"},{"name":"Jeong Ho Lee","affiliation":["Div. of Electronics and Electrical Eng., Dongguk University, Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Jeong Ho","lastName":"Lee","id":"37085560888"},{"name":"Seung-Hoon Hwang","affiliation":["Div. of Electronics and Electrical Eng., Dongguk University, Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Seung-Hoon","lastName":"Hwang","id":"37292257600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6786-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2162-1233"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2162-1241"}],"articleNumber":"6983166","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":66},"abstract":"In this paper, we suggest a simple time diversity scheme for a subcarrier intensity modulation/spatial modulation (SIM/SM) system in a AWGN channel, as the time diversity technique can accomplish a sensible diversity gain without increasing the complexity with multiple receivers.

This study compares the timing synchronization performance of these modulation techniques by using a simple non-data-aided algorithm. The experimental results indicate that the timing metric curve of N-continuous OFDM becomes flat near the ideal timing to detect an OFDM symbol. On the other hand, the curve of NCSP-OFDM exhibits a sharp peak, although its time has the gap against the ideal timing. We propose a gap-corrected ML estimation of time offset.

In the system with MRSs, some of mobile stations (MSs) can act as relay stations (RSs) that forward other MSs data from/to the base station (BS). Compared with the fixed RSs, MRSs have several advantages such as low deployment costs and high flexibility. In this paper, we study an opportunistic subchannel scheduling in orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) cellular networks with MRSs. We formulate a stochastic optimization problem to maximize the sum-rate of the system with MRSs while satisfying the minimum average data rate requirement for each MS, and then develop an optimal opportunistic subchannel scheduling algorithm by solving it.

Two-types of extreme beamforming schemes at small cell base stations (BSs) are considered based on local channel state information (CSI) at transmitter: i) maximizing the desired channel gain and ii) minimizing the interference generated by each small cell base station (BS). Then, we propose a beamforming scheme that minimizes weighted generating-interference in pursuit of enhancing the achievable rate. In particular, an additional scalar information exchange is assumed between the BSs via a low-rate interface such as the X-2 interface in the 3GPP standards. By carefully choosing the weight coefficients based on the signal-to-interference-and-noise-ratios (SINRs), the scheme balances between these two philosophies - egoism and altruism. Simulation results show that there exists a trade-off between the amount of CSI knowledge and the achievable rate.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICTC.2014.6983178","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6983064","startPage":"446","endPage":"449","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 International Conference on Information and Communication Technology Convergence (ICTC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6966882/6983064/06983178.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Downlink beamforming in small cells with scalar information exchange","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6983178/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 Oct. 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6983178/","displayDocTitle":"Downlink beamforming in small cells with scalar information exchange","conferenceDate":"22-24 Oct. 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","accessionNumber":"14833566","dateOfInsertion":"15 December 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Downlink beamforming in small cells with scalar information exchange","confLoc":"Busan, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"S523.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049342S","chronDate":"22-24 Oct. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6966882","isNumber":"6983064","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6966882","xplore-issue":"6983064","articleId":"6983178","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":6983179,"authors":[{"name":"Qi Li","affiliation":["School of Aerospace, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China","Tsinghua National Laboratory for Information Science and Technology"],"firstName":"Qi","lastName":"Li","id":"37085470510"},{"name":"Xinru Qu","affiliation":["EDA Laboratory, Research Institute of Tsinghua University in Shenzhen, Shenzhen, China"],"firstName":"Xinru","lastName":"Qu","id":"37085454304"},{"name":"Liuguo Yin","affiliation":["EDA Laboratory, Research Institute of Tsinghua University in Shenzhen, Shenzhen, China"],"firstName":"Liuguo","lastName":"Yin","id":"37274088100"},{"name":"Jianhua Lu","affiliation":["Dept. of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China","Tsinghua National Laboratory for Information Science and Technology"],"firstName":"Jianhua","lastName":"Lu","id":"37278637500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6786-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2162-1233"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2162-1241"}],"articleNumber":"6983179","dbTime":"21 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":121},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Error correction","Error correction codes","Parity check codes","Channel capacity","Signal to noise ratio","Jamming","Optimization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel capacity","channel coding","code division multiple access","frequency hop communication","jamming","optimisation","parity check codes","spread spectrum communication","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["generalized low-density parity-check code","EXIT chart method","data transmission","partial-band jamming channel","low coding-rate channel code","frequency-hopping spread-spectrum transmission system","FH-SS transmission system","wireless channel","extrinsic mutual information transfer","GLDPC code","PBJ transmission environment","PBJ channel","code optimization method","near-capacity performance","channel capacity","signal-to-noise ratio","SNR","partial-band jamming transmission environment","noise figure -8 dB"]}],"abstract":"The design and optimization of low coding-rate channel codes is a hot topic for frequency-hopping spread-spectrum (FH-SS) transmission systems over harsh wireless channels.

Since this FD system induces the inter-user interference from UL user to DL user, the main challenge for maximizing the system performances is user pairing that makes a pair of DL user and UL user to use the same radio resource simultaneously. We formulate two optimization problems for user pairing to maximize the cell throughput or minimize the outage probability, and then propose two suboptimal user pairing algorithms with low complexity. The first algorithm is designed in a way where the DL user with a better signal quality has a higher priority to choose its UL user for the throughput maximization. On the contrary, the second algorithm gives the DL user with a worse signal quality a higher priority to choose its UL user for the outage minimization. Simulation results show that the FD system using the proposed user pairing algorithms achieves the optimal performances and significantly outperforms the conventional TDD system in terms of the cell throughput and the outage probability.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 Oct. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6983189/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"14833432","publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","conferenceDate":"22-24 Oct. 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6983189/","dateOfInsertion":"15 December 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"On the design of user pairing algorithms in full duplexing wireless cellular networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the design of user pairing algorithms in full duplexing wireless cellular networks","confLoc":"Busan, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"S611.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054601S","chronDate":"22-24 Oct. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6966882","isNumber":"6983064","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6966882","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"6983064","articleId":"6983189","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6983191,"authors":[{"name":"Sang Won Choi","affiliation":["ICT Convergence Research Team, KRRI, Uiwang, South Korea"],"firstName":"Sang Won","lastName":"Choi","id":"37085437426"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6786-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2162-1233"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2162-1241"}],"articleNumber":"6983191","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":42},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6983191","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Correlation","Interference","Mobile communication","Array signal processing","Integrated circuits","Encoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","block codes","decoding","fading channels","MIMO communication","multi-access systems","optimisation","radiofrequency interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["beamforming design","multiuser distributed communications","beamforming techniques","multiple-input single-output interference channel","correlated block fading","beamforming vectors","coding block","single-user decoding","Gaussian input constraint","beamforming schemes"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICTC.2014.6983191","publicationTitle":"2014 International Conference on Information and Communication Technology Convergence (ICTC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 International Conference on Information and Communication Technology Convergence (ICTC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6966882/6983064/06983191.pdf","startPage":"498","endPage":"499","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICTC.2014.6983191","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6983064","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Near optimal beamforming design for efficient multi-user distributed communications","abstract":"For efficient multi-user distributed communications, near optimal beamforming techniques for multiple-input single-output interference channel with correlated block fading are proposed in this paper.

However, due to new features of RF energy harvesting and transfer, the resource allocation problem becomes more challenging, which has to take the RF energy supply into consideration. The resource allocation schemes developed for traditional wireless networks are no longer applicable due to asymmetric features (e.g., doubly near-far problem). In this article, we highlight beamforming and stochastic optimization techniques to address the asymmetric features in wireless powered communication networks (WPCNs). These studies lead to the novel design methodology to understand and optimize new types of the WPCNs. Nevertheless, the methodology is implementable in an actual network, where the prototype and system can be developed to demonstrate the feasibility and the success of using the beamforming and stochastic optimization techniques in solving the crucial issues in the WPCNs.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICTC.2014.6983280","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6983064","startPage":"760","endPage":"762","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 International Conference on Information and Communication Technology Convergence (ICTC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6966882/6983064/06983280.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Wireless energy harvesting communications: Beamforming and stochastic optimization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6983280/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 Oct. 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6983280/","displayDocTitle":"Wireless energy harvesting communications: Beamforming and stochastic optimization","conferenceDate":"22-24 Oct. 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","accessionNumber":"14833494","dateOfInsertion":"15 December 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wireless energy harvesting communications: Beamforming and stochastic optimization","confLoc":"Busan, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"P210.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049894S","chronDate":"22-24 Oct. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6966882","isNumber":"6983064","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6966882","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6983064","articleId":"6983280","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6983282,"authors":[{"name":"Minki Ahn","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Korea University, Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Minki","lastName":"Ahn","id":"37085438578"},{"name":"Inkyu Lee","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Korea University, Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Inkyu","lastName":"Lee","id":"37279664500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6786-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2162-1233"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2162-1241"}],"articleNumber":"6983282","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":146},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Complexity theory","Directive antennas","Signal to noise ratio","Downlink","Closed-form solutions","Educational institutions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","computational complexity","MIMO communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["exhaustive algorithm","low complexity vertical sectorization algorithm","optimal tilt angle","computational complexity","multiple vertical beams","antenna beam pattern","AAS","MISO downlink","multiple-input single-output downlink","active antenna system"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Active antenna system","Vertical sectorization","MISO downlink"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6983282","doi":"10.1109/ICTC.2014.6983282","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICTC.2014.6983282","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6983064","publicationTitle":"2014 International Conference on Information and Communication Technology Convergence (ICTC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 International Conference on Information and Communication Technology Convergence (ICTC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6966882/6983064/06983282.pdf","startPage":"765","endPage":"767","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Vertical sectorization techniques for active antenna systems","abstract":"In this paper, we study vertical sectorization techniques for multiple-input single-output (MISO) downlink active antenna systems (AAS).

As next generation cellular wireless networks are crowded with ever-high capacity demand and new applications, efficient resource allocation will be crucial for system performance enhancement and economical competitiveness. This paper proposes a universal resource allocation method applicable to all H-FDD, FDD and TDD. In the most complicated case of H-FDD, the proposed scheme jointly optimizes mobile station (MS) grouping and frame partitioning in addition to resource allocation. We develop a near-optimum and low-complexity algorithm for H-FDD resource allocation from the universal formulation, and show that it can be applied to FDD and TDD as special cases. Simulation results demonstrate that our algorithm can provide performance gain close to that of the optimum but time-consuming exhaustive search.","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 International

Single Disk Failure Recovery Scheme for Erasure Coded Storage Systems","abstract":"The fast growing of data scale encourages the wide employment of data disks with large storage capacity. However, a mass of data disks' equipment will in turn increase the probability of data loss or damage, because of the appearance of various kinds of disk failures. To ensure the intactness of the hosted data, modern storage systems usually adopt erasure codes, which can recover the lost data by pre-storing a small amount of redundant information. As the most common case among all the recovery mechanisms, the single disk failure recovery has been receiving intensive attentions for the past few years. However, most of existing works in this literature still take the stripe-level recovery as their only consideration, and a considerable performance improvement on single failure disk reconstruction in the stack-level (i.e., a group of rotated stripes) is missed. To seize this potential improvement, in this paper we systematically study the problem of single failure recovery in the stack-level. We first propose our recovery mechanism based on greedy algorithm to seek for the near-optimal solution (BP-Scheme) for any erasure array code in stack level, and further design a rotated recovery algorithm (RR-Algorithm) to eliminate the size of required memory. Through a rigorous statistic analysis and intensive evaluation on a real system, the results show that BP-Scheme gains at most 38.9% higher recovery speed than Khan's Scheme, and owns up to 34.8% higher recovery speed than Luo's U-Scheme.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"6-9 Oct. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6983388/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6983388/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"14827350","conferenceDate":"6-9 Oct. 2014","publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"15 December 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A Stack-Based Single Disk Failure Recovery Scheme for Erasure Coded Storage Systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Stack-Based Single Disk Failure Recovery Scheme for Erasure Coded Storage Systems","confLoc":"Nara, Japan","sourcePdf":"5584a136.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.099945S","chronDate":"6-9 Oct. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6979347","isNumber":"6983362","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6979347","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"6983362","articleId":"6983388","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":6983464,"authors":[{"name":"Eugenio Yime","affiliation":["Universidad Tecnolgica de Bolvar"],"firstName":"Eugenio","lastName":"Yime","id":"37545863600"},{"name":"Jose Luis Villa","affiliation":["Universidad Tecnolgica de Bolvar"],"firstName":"Jose Luis","lastName":"Villa","id":"38273609800"},{"name":"Jheifer Paez","affiliation":["Universidad Tecnolgica de Bolvar"],"firstName":"Jheifer","lastName":"Paez","id":"37085335586"},{"name":"Humberto Ortiz","affiliation":["Universidad Tecnolgica de Bolvar"],"firstName":"Humberto","lastName":"Ortiz","id":"37085405129"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7932-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-7931-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6983464","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":95},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6983464","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robots","Patents","Fasteners","Mechatronics","Contracts","Optimization","Gears"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["manipulator kinematics","mechatronics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mechatronic design","automated storage system","confined space","automatic storing","space optimization","robotic arm","safe-deposit boxes"]}],"abstract":"It is here presented the mechatronic design of an system with automatic storing and picking of small products.

Finally, we compare all proposed schemes and show how spatially coupled Low-Density Parity-Check (LDPC) codes outperform conventional LDPC and polar codes with similar receiver complexity and memory requirements.","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2014.2379957","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/50/7054616/06983533.pdf","startPage":"1109","endPage":"1116","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7054616","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2014.2379957","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spatially Coupled Soft-Decision Error Correction for Future Lightwave Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6983533","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"March1, 1 2015","displayDocTitle":"Spatially Coupled Soft-Decision Error Correction for Future Lightwave Systems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6983533/","publicationDate":"1 March1, 2015","dateOfInsertion":"09 March 2015","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"14982590","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6983533/","volume":"33","issue":"5","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 December 2014","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"German Government","grantNumber":"German CELTIC+/BMBF"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spatially Coupled Soft-Decision Error Correction for Future Lightwave Systems","sourcePdf":"jlt-schmalen-2379957-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.188095S","chronDate":"March1, 1 2015","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"7054616","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"74","xplore-issue":"7054616","articleId":"6983533","onlineDate":"12 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6983535,"authors":[{"name":"Zhiyuan Gao","affiliation":["School of Electronic Information Engineering, Tianjin University, Tianjin, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7361/7086408/6983535/gao-2379942-small.gif","p":["Zhiyuan Gao received the B.E. degree from the School of Electronic Information Engineering, Tianjin University, Tianjin, China, in 2010, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree in microelectronics and solid electronics."]},"firstName":"Zhiyuan","lastName":"Gao","id":"37085495653"},{"name":"Suying Yao","affiliation":["School of Electronic Information Engineering, Tianjin University, Tianjin, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7361/7086408/6983535/yao-2379942-small.gif","p":["Suying Yao (M\u201911) received the B.E. degree from Tianjin University, Tianjin, China, in 1970.","She is currently a Professor and Ph.D. Candidate Supervisor with the School of Electronic Information and Engineering, Tianjin University, where she is also the Director of the ASIC Design Center.

The transfer transistor of the 4-T pixel acts as an overflow transistor in this proposed method. The full well capacity of photodiode (PD) can be very well controlled by biasing the transfer gate at different states. The long and short time exposed signals can be both stored in PD by adjusting the transfer gate voltage, and such the wide dynamic range signal can be obtained without extra readout operation. A proto chip with 64 \u00d7 48 pixel array is fabricated in 0.18-\u03bc m CIS process. The sensor structure is based on a typical 4-T pixel image sensor with modified transfer gate driver and timing. This structure not only maintains the good features of 4-T pixels, such as good fill factor and low noise, but also achieves a wide dynamic range. The dynamic range of the proto chip is extended from 51.59 to 90.53 dB.","doi":"10.1109/JSEN.2014.2379942","publicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/7361/7086408/06983535.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSEN.2014.2379942","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7086408","startPage":"3265","endPage":"3273","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Dynamic Range Extension Technique for CMOS Image Sensors With In-Pixel Dual Exposure Synthesis","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6983535","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Dynamic Range Extension Technique for CMOS Image Sensors With In-Pixel Dual Exposure Synthesis","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6983535/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 December 2014","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"15","issue":"6","publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15089448","dateOfInsertion":"30 April 2015","htmlLink":"/document/6983535/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61036004 and 61274021"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Dynamic Range Extension Technique for CMOS Image Sensors With In-Pixel Dual Exposure Synthesis","sourcePdf":"jsen-xu-2379942-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.108245S","chronDate":"June  2015","xplore-pub-id":"7361","isNumber":"7086408","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7361","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"7086408","articleId":"6983535","onlineDate":"12 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6983537,"authors":[{"name":"Pierluigi Salvo Rossi","affiliation":["Department of Electronics & Telecommunications, Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU), Trondheim, Norway"],"firstName":"Pierluigi","lastName":"Salvo Rossi","id":"37085389166"},{"name":"Domenico Ciuonzo","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering & Information Technology, University Naples \u201cFederico II\u201d, Naples, Italy"],"firstName":"Domenico","lastName":"Ciuonzo","id":"37596948400"},{"name":"Kimmo Kansanen","affiliation":["Department of Electronics & Telecommunications, Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU), Trondheim, Norway"],"firstName":"Kimmo","lastName":"Kansanen","id":"37281872600"},{"name":"Torbj\u00f6rn Ekman","affiliation":["Department of Electronics & Telecommunications, Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU), Trondheim, Norway"],"firstName":"Torbj\u00f6rn","lastName":"Ekman","id":"37318026000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"6983537","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":33,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":621},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wireless sensor networks","Rayleigh channels","MIMO","Vectors","Receiving antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplitude shift keying","antenna arrays","fading channels","Gaussian processes","MIMO communication","mixture models","sensor fusion","signal detection","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy detection","MIMO decision fusion","wireless sensor networks","NLOS fading","on-off keying","OOK","statistical channel state information","fusion center","FC","multiple antennas","zero-mean Gaussian mixtures","GM","arbitrary non-line-of-sight environments","numerical simulations"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Decision fusion","energy detection","multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)","non-line-of-sight (NLOS) fading","wireless sensor network (WSN)"]},{"kwd":["Decision fusion","energy detection","multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)","non-line-of-sight (NLOS) fading","wireless sensor network (WSN)"]}],"abstract":"We analyze sufficiency and optimality of energy detection (ED) for decision fusion.

In bi-directional relaying, two users exchange their information, with the help of a relay, in two time slots and, hence, achieve full-rate transmission. This paper considers a relay assisted bi-directional free-space optical communication system under the influence of generalized atmospheric turbulence fading and misalignment errors. The turbulence induced fading channels, which are independent but not necessarily identical, are modeled with M-distribution. In the presence of the misalignment fading characterized by the pointing errors, the new closed-form expressions for the outage probability and error rate are derived. The error performance of the considered system is analyzed for subcarrier intensity modulation-based M-ary phase-shift keying and M-ary quadrature-amplitude modulation constellations. The analytical results are validated through Monte Carlo simulations.","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/50/6987389/06983538.pdf","startPage":"133","endPage":"139","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2014.2379950","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2014.2379950","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6987389","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6983538","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Relay Assisted Bi-directional Communication in Generalized Turbulence Fading","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Fading","Atmospheric modeling","Bidirectional control","Bit error rate","Signal to noise ratio","Closed-form solutions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Monte Carlo methods","optical communication","phase shift keying","quadrature amplitude modulation","relay networks (telecommunication)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["relay assisted bi-directional free-space optical communication system","generalized atmospheric turbulence fading","misalignment errors","turbulence induced fading channels","M-distribution","closed-form expressions","outage probability","subcarrier intensity modulation-based M-ary phase-shift keying","M-ary quadrature-amplitude modulation constellations","Monte Carlo simulations"]},{"kwd":["Bi-directional relaying","free space optical communication","atmospheric turbulence","misalignment error"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6983538/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.1, 1 2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 December 2014","displayDocTitle":"Relay Assisted Bi-directional Communication in Generalized Turbulence Fading","volume":"33","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/6983538/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"1 Jan.1, 2015","accessionNumber":"14861904","dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Relay Assisted Bi-directional Communication in Generalized Turbulence Fading","sourcePdf":"jlt-garg-2379950-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.094732S","chronDate":"Jan.1, 1 2015","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"6987389","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"6987389","articleId":"6983538","onlineDate":"12 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6983542,"authors":[{"name":"Ivan S.

The retention failure mechanism of the low-resistance state (LRS) for conductive bridge RAM is generally originated from the lateral diffusion of metal ions/atoms from the filament to its surrounding medium. In this letter, we proposed an effective method to improve the LRS retention by controlling the formation of the single filament. For a certain LRS, the effective surface area for metal ions/atoms diffusion in single filament is less than that of multi-filament. Thus, better LRS retention characteristics can be achieved by reducing the metal species diffusion. The validity of this method is verified by the superior retention characteristics of the LRS programmed by current mode, in comparison with voltage programming mode. The former tends to generate a single filament, while the later grows multi-filament. This letter provides a possible way to enhance the retention characteristics of RRAM.","doi":"10.1109/LED.2014.2379961","publicationTitle":"IEEE Electron Device Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Electron Device Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/55/7019014/06983546.pdf","startPage":"129","endPage":"131","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LED.2014.2379961","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7019014","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Superior Retention of Low-Resistance State in Conductive Bridge Random Access Memory With Single Filament Formation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 December 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6983546/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2015","displayDocTitle":"Superior Retention of Low-Resistance State in Conductive Bridge Random Access Memory With Single Filament Formation","dateOfInsertion":"23 January 2015","htmlLink":"/document/6983546/","accessionNumber":"14866737","volume":"36","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 2015","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Ministry of Science and Technology, China","grantNumber":"2011AA010402, 2011CBA00602, 2011CB921804, 2011CB707600, 2011AA010401 and 2011CB70"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61106082, 61376112, 61334007, 61221004, 61274091 and 61106119"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Superior Retention of Low-Resistance State in Conductive Bridge Random Access Memory With Single Filament Formation","sourcePdf":"led-lv-2379961-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.048076S","chronDate":"Feb.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"55","isNumber":"7019014","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"55","citationCount":"38","xplore-issue":"7019014","articleId":"6983546","onlineDate":"12 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6983548,"authors":[{"name":"Jagannath Malik","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee, Roorkee, India"],"firstName":"Jagannath","lastName":"Malik","id":"37085373603"},{"name":"Amalendu Patnaik","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee, Roorkee, India"],"firstName":"Amalendu","lastName":"Patnaik","orcid":"0000-0001-6892-7329","id":"37284365100"},{"name":"M.

First, the source multifocus images are decomposed using the nonsubsampled contourlet transform (NSCT). The low-frequency sub-band coefficients are fused by the sum-modified-Laplacian-based local visual contrast, whereas the high-frequency sub-band coefficients are fused by the local Log-Gabor energy. The initial fused image is subsequently reconstructed based on the inverse NSCT with the fused coefficients. Second, after analyzing the similarity between the previous fused image and the source images, the initial focus area detection map is obtained, which is used for achieving the decision map obtained by employing a mathematical morphology postprocessing technique. Finally, based on the decision map, the final fused image is obtained by selecting the pixels in the focus areas and retaining the pixels in the focus region boundary as their corresponding pixels in the initial fused image. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method is better than various existing transform-based fusion methods, including gradient pyramid transform, discrete wavelet transform, NSCT, and a spatial-based method, in terms of both subjective and objective evaluations.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors

Mapped Correlation of ID for RFID Anti-Collision","abstract":"One of the key problems that should be solved is the collision between tags which lowers the efficiency of the RFID system. The existed popular anti-collision algorithms are ALOHA-type algorithms and QT. But these methods show good performance when the number of tags to read is small and not dynamic. However, when the number of tags to read is large and dynamic, the efficiency of recognition is very low. A novel approach to mapped correlation of ID for RFID anti-collision has been proposed to solve the problem in this paper. This method can increase the association between tags so that tags can send their own ID under certain trigger conditions, by mapped correlation of ID, querying on multi-tree becomes more efficient. In the case of not too big number of tags, by replacing the actual ID with the temporary ID, the method can greatly reduce the number of times that the reader reads and writes to tag's ID. In the case of dynamic ALOHA-type applications, the reader can determine the locations of the empty slots according to the position of the binary pulse, so it can avoid the decrease in efficiency which is caused by reading empty slots when reading slots. Experiments have shown this method can greatly improve the recognition efficiency of the system.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.-Dec. 1 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6983579/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct.-Dec. 1 2014","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"14824245","volume":"7","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/6983579/","publicationDate":"1 Oct.-Dec. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Novel Approach to Mapped Correlation of ID for RFID Anti-Collision","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61202169"},{"fundingName":"Tianjin Key Natural Science Foundation","grantNumber":"13JCZDJC34600"},{"fundingName":"CSC Foundation","grantNumber":"201308120010"},{"fundingName":"Training plan of Tianjin University Innovation Team","grantNumber":"TD12-5016"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel Approach to Mapped Correlation of ID for RFID Anti-Collision","sourcePdf":"tsc-zhang-2370642-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.072812S","chronDate":"Oct.-Dec. 1 2014","xplore-pub-id":"4629386","isNumber":"6983668","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4629386","citationCount":"138","xplore-issue":"6983668","articleId":"6983579","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":6983581,"authors":[{"name":"Jianlong Fu","affiliation":["National Laboratory of Pattern Recognition, Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/76/7174606/6983581/fu-2380211-small.gif","p":["Jianlong Fu received the B.E. degree from University of Science and Technology Beijing, Beijing, China, in 2010.

The quality of tag refinement depends on the quality of concept representations that build a mapping from concepts to visual images. While good progress was made in the past decade on tag refinement, the previous approaches only achieved a limited success due to their limited concept representations. In this paper, we show that the visual appearances of a concept consist of both a generic view and a specific view, and therefore we can comprehensively represent a concept by two components. To ensure a clean concept representation, this representation is learned on clean click-through data, where noises are greatly reduced. In the framework, a coarse-to-fine image tag refinement is proposed, which: (1) first generates an efficient star graph to find candidate tags but missing in the initial tag list of an input image and (2) guided by this view-dependent concept representation, formulates a probabilistic objective function to eliminate irrelevant tags. Extensive experiments on two widely used standard data sets (MIRFlickr-25K and NUS-WIDE-270K) demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6983581/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 December 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2015","volume":"25","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"31 July 2015","publicationDate":"Aug. 2015","accessionNumber":"15342490","htmlLink":"/document/6983581/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Image Tag Refinement With View-Dependent Concept Representations","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"863 Program","grantNumber":"2014AA015104"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61273034 and 61332016"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Image Tag Refinement With View-Dependent Concept Representations","sourcePdf":"tcsvt-wang-2380211-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.083312S","chronDate":"Aug.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"76","isNumber":"7174606","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"7174606","articleId":"6983581","onlineDate":"12 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6983587,"authors":[{"name":"Dario Perez-Calderon","affiliation":["Escuela Superior de Ingenieros, Universidad de Sevilla, Sevilla, Spain"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/11/7050389/6983587/perez-2367991-small.gif","p":["Dario Perez-Calderon was born in Jerez de la Frontera, Spain.

One of the most promising techniques to improve the system capacity is multiple input multiple output (MIMO). However, the use of MIMO implies a huge complexity increase in the detection process. In this paper, a method to reduce the aforementioned complexity is presented. Although the proposed method is analyzed for digital video broadcasting next generation for handhelds, its implementation is useful for any MIMO system that requires the computation of log likelihood ratios (LLRs), used by the low density parity check codes. The presented technique consists of applying a simplification when calculating the Euclidean distances needed by the LLRs. The simplification avoids almost all the multiplications, very area demanding when translated into hardware, and presents a performance loss under 0.1 dB.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting","pdfPath":"/iel7/11/7050389/06983587.pdf","startPage":"84","endPage":"90","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting","doi":"10.1109/TBC.2014.2367991","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBC.2014.2367991","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7050389","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6983587","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Simplified Detection for DVB-NGH MIMO Decoders","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Digital video broadcasting","Complexity theory","Decoding","Transmitting antennas","Approximation methods","Receiving antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","digital video broadcasting","maximum likelihood decoding","maximum likelihood detection","MIMO communication","next generation networks","parity check codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DVB-NGH MIMO decoder","multiple input multiple output system capacity improvement","aforementioned complexity reduction","log likelihood ratio","LLR","low density parity check code","Simplified Detection process","Euclidean distance","digital video broadcasting next generation for handheld"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Digital video broadcasting next generation for handhelds (DVB-NGH)","multiple input multiple output (MIMO)","decoder","orthogonal frequency division multiplexion (OFDM)"]},{"kwd":["Digital video broadcasting next generation for handhelds (DVB-NGH)","multiple input multiple output (MIMO)","decoder","orthogonal frequency division multiplexion (OFDM)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6983587/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 December 2014","displayDocTitle":"Simplified Detection for DVB-NGH MIMO Decoders","volume":"61","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/6983587/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2015","accessionNumber":"14964468","dateOfInsertion":"02 March 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Spanish Government","grantNumber":"TEC2010-17029"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Simplified Detection for DVB-NGH MIMO Decoders","sourcePdf":"tbc-perezcalderon-2367991-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.104413S","chronDate":"March  2015","xplore-pub-id":"11","isNumber":"7050389","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"11","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"7050389","articleId":"6983587","onlineDate":"12 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6983592,"authors":[{"name":"Marco Donald Migliore","affiliation":["DIEI, University of Cassino and Southern Lazio, Cassino, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8/7027885/6983592/6983592-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Marco Donald Migliore (M'04) received the Laurea degree (hons) in electronic engineering and the Ph.D. degree in electronic engineering from the University of Naples, Naples, Italy.","He is currently an Associate Professor at the University of Cassino, Cassino, Italy.

The method adopted in this paper uses an intuitive geometrical approach based on the Johnson-Linderstrauss lemma applied to the \u03b5-net of the set of the fields radiated by the sparse source. The paper shows that a proper Non Uniform Random Sampling (NURS) using some a-priori information on the problem allows a significant reduction in the cardinality of the set of the measured data compared to uniform random sampling and to random sampling from a \u03bb/2 equispaced set of data. It is also shown that there is a limiting number of data after which random sampling is not convenient. In this case a deterministic sampling strategy, called Modified Non Uniform Sampling (MNUS), is proposed.

To achieve high penetration depth of renewable sources into the utility grid, a novel system operation strategy and the corresponding energy management method is proposed. In the operation strategy, the ultracapacitor unit works as the sole voltage source of the micro-grid to support the dc link in both connected and islanding mode. The micro-grid is controlled to deliver/absorb predefined amount of power to/from the utility grid during connected mode and zero during islanding mode. This design will certainly simplify the power dispatching algorithm of the power system and increase the possibility of including large quantities of micro-grids into the utility grid. The energy management method is dedicated to conducting the net power of the micro-grid effectively. The net power is separated into high- and low-frequency components. The high-frequency power is suppressed by the ultracapacitor automatically and the low frequency power is shared by the battery and an adjustment unit. A small-scale dc micro-grid structure with a single dc link is considered for investigation.

By symmetrically introducing one or two pairs of slot stubs along the slotline resonator near the nulls of electric field distribution of the second odd-order mode, two modes are excited in a single slotline radiator. With the help of these stubs, the second odd-order mode can be gradually merged with its first counterpart, resulting in a wideband radiation characteristic with two resonances. Prototype antennas are then designed and fabricated to experimentally validate the principle and design approach. It is shown that the operation fractional bandwidth of the proposed slotline antenna could be effectively increased to 31.5% while keeping an inherent narrow slot structure.","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2014.2379921","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel7/8/7027885/06983596.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2014.2379921","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7027885","startPage":"818","endPage":"823","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Wideband Stub-Loaded Slotline Antennas Under Multi-Mode Resonance Operation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6983596","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Wideband Stub-Loaded Slotline Antennas Under Multi-Mode Resonance Operation","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6983596/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 December 2014","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"63","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 2015","accessionNumber":"14914998","dateOfInsertion":"30 January 2015","htmlLink":"/document/6983596/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wideband Stub-Loaded Slotline Antennas Under Multi-Mode Resonance Operation","sourcePdf":"tap-lu-2379921-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.068305S","chronDate":"Feb.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"7027885","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"74","xplore-issue":"7027885","articleId":"6983596","onlineDate":"12 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-29"},{"_id":6983599,"authors":[{"name":"Jaeho Kim","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, UNIST (Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology), Ulsan, Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/12/7430016/6983599/kim-small.gif","p":["Jaeho Kim received the BS degree in information and communications\n engineering from Inje University, Gimhae, Korea, in 2004, and the MS and PhD degrees in computer science from the\n University of Seoul, Seoul, Korea, in 2009 and 2015, respectively.

An approach to remedy this loss is to employ the RAID architecture with the chips that comprise SSDs. However, using the traditional RAID approach may result in negative effects as the total number of writes is increased due to the parity updates. In this paper, we describe Elastic Striping and Anywhere Parity (eSAP)-RAID, a RAID scheme that allows flexible stripe sizes and parity placement. Using performance and lifetime models that we derive of SSDs employing RAID-5 and eSAP-RAID, we show that eSAP-RAID brings about significant performance and reliability benefits by reducing parity writes compared to RAID-5. We also implement these schemes in SSDs using DiskSim with SSD Extension and validate the models using realistic workloads. We also discuss policies such as dynamic stripe sizing and selective data protection that exploits the flexible nature of eSAP. We show that through such policies particular reliability enhancement goals can be met.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Chip-Level RAID with Flexible Stripe Size and Parity Placement for Enhanced SSD Reliability","doi":"10.1109/TC.2014.2375179","startPage":"1116","endPage":"1130","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.2014.2375179","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7430016","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel7/12/7430016/06983599.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6983599","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 December 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6983599/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April 1 2016","displayDocTitle":"Chip-Level RAID with Flexible Stripe Size and Parity Placement for Enhanced SSD Reliability","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"65","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/6983599/","dateOfInsertion":"14 March 2016","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"1 April 2016","accessionNumber":"15852812","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Seoul Creative Human Development Program"},{"fundingName":"Seoul Metropolitan Government","grantNumber":"HM120006"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100007431","fundingName":"National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF)"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004085","fundingName":"Korea government (MEST)","grantNumber":"2012R1A2A2A01045733"},{"fundingName":"Basic Science Research Program"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100007431","fundingName":"National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF)"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004085","fundingName":"Ministry of Education, Science and Technology","grantNumber":"2010-0025282"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Chip-Level RAID with Flexible Stripe Size and Parity Placement for Enhanced SSD Reliability","sourcePdf":"tc-kim-2375179-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.179784S","chronDate":"April 1 2016","xplore-pub-id":"12","isNumber":"7430016","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"7430016","articleId":"6983599","onlineDate":"12 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6983600,"authors":[{"name":"Ming Jin","affiliation":["College of Information Science and Engineering, University of Wollongong, Wollongong, NSW, Australia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/7323911/6983600/jin-2379924-small.gif","p":["\n\nMing Jin received the B.E. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from Xidian University, Xi'an, China, in 2005 and 2010, respectively.","He is currently with the College of Information Science and Engineering, Ningbo University, Zhejiang, China.

However, its performance severely degrades with the decrease of signal correlations. In this work, a weighted-covariance-based detector is proposed by introducing data-aided weights to the covariance matrix. The false alarm probability, decision threshold, and detection probability are analyzed in the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime, and their approximate analytical expressions are derived based on the central limit theorem.

Recently, compressive sensing (CS) is explored to solve those problems, but it heavily relies on the sparsity level of the channel, which is unknown in practice. In this paper, a signal-to-noise ratio-based sparsity estimation method is proposed to detect the sparsity level of the channel. Then we propose the priori aided subspace pursuit algorithm if the channel sparsity meets the theoretical CS model, otherwise we use an improved iterative channel estimation method with the help of the channel sparsity. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme could improve the robustness and performance of TDS-OFDM systems compared with the conventional iterative methods or recently proposed CS based methods.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6983610/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 December 2014","volume":"61","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"14964465","publicationDate":"March 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6983610/","dateOfInsertion":"02 March 2015","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Sparsity-Aware Adaptive Channel Estimation Based on SNR Detection","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Nature Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61271266"},{"fundingName":"National Key Basic Research Program of China","grantNumber":"2013CB329203"},{"fundingName":"National High Technology Research and Development Program of China","grantNumber":"2014AA01A704"},{"fundingName":"Beijing Natural Science Foundation","grantNumber":"4142027"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sparsity-Aware Adaptive Channel Estimation Based on SNR Detection","sourcePdf":"tbc-zhu-2372271-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.106791S","chronDate":"March  2015","xplore-pub-id":"11","isNumber":"7050389","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"11","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"7050389","articleId":"6983610","onlineDate":"12 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6983611,"authors":[{"name":"Cheng Yu-Chun","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan, R.O.C"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/12/7240148/6983611/chen-small.gif","p":["Yu-Chun Chen received his Master degree in computer sciense and\n infomation engineering in Nation Central University of ROC, Taiwan in 2006, and Ph.D degree in Nation Taiwan\n University of ROC, Taiwan in 2012.

Regarding the upper-layer of protocol stacks, wireless transmission control protocols (WTCPs) are proposed to deal with transmission control protocol (TCP) performance problems on wireless networks. However, some new lower-layer solutions, e.g., cognitive radio (CR) systems, cause new throughput decay problems to TCPs, which existing WTCPs do not solve. In this paper, we study throughput decay issues in CR environments and discuss three events that cause these problems. Three event handlers are proposed to improve TCP throughput. The proposed solutions are designed by numerical analysis, and performance improvement is verified by NS2. We propose an event-driven CR-TCP that combines these event handlers, which can be combined with state-of-art CR-TCP solutions. Simulation results and analysis are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed solution.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.2014.2375186","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7240148","startPage":"2730","endPage":"3740","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel7/12/7240148/06983611.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Cognitive TCP Design for a Cognitive Radio Network with an Unstable-Bandwidth Link","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6983611/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 1 2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 December 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6983611/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Cognitive TCP Design for a Cognitive Radio Network with an Unstable-Bandwidth Link","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"1 Oct. 2015","accessionNumber":"15432830","dateOfInsertion":"03 September 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"64","issue":"10","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Cognitive TCP Design for a Cognitive Radio Network with an Unstable-Bandwidth Link","sourcePdf":"tc-wu-2375186-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.104299S","chronDate":"Oct. 1 2015","xplore-pub-id":"12","isNumber":"7240148","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7240148","articleId":"6983611","onlineDate":"12 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6983613,"authors":[{"name":"Hongwei Li","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6245516/7055204/6983613/li-2371239-small.gif","p":["Hongwei Li (M\u201912) is currently an Associate Professor with the School of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China, where he received the Ph.D. degree in computer software and theory, in 2008.

The outsourced data, however, need to be encrypted due to the privacy and confidentiality concerns of their owner. This results in the distinguished difficulties on the accurate search over the encrypted mobile cloud data. To tackle this issue, in this paper, we develop the searchable encryption for multi-keyword ranked search over the storage data. Specifically, by considering the large number of outsourced documents (data) in the cloud, we utilize the relevance score and k-nearest neighbor techniques to develop an efficient multi-keyword search scheme that can return the ranked search results based on the accuracy. Within this framework, we leverage an efficient index to further improve the search efficiency, and adopt the blind storage system to conceal access pattern of the search user. Security analysis demonstrates that our scheme can achieve confidentiality of documents and index, trapdoor privacy, trapdoor unlinkability, and concealing access pattern of the search user. Finally, using extensive simulations, we show that our proposal can achieve much improved efficiency in terms of search functionality and search time compared with the existing proposals.","doi":"10.1109/TETC.2014.2371239","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7055204","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TETC.2014.2371239","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Emerging Topics in Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Emerging Topics in Computing","pdfPath":"/iel7/6245516/7055204/06983613.pdf","startPage":"127","endPage":"138","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Enabling Efficient Multi-Keyword Ranked Search Over Encrypted Mobile Cloud Data Through Blind Storage","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 December 2014","displayDocTitle":"Enabling Efficient Multi-Keyword Ranked Search Over Encrypted Mobile Cloud Data Through Blind Storage","volume":"3","issue":"1","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2015","dateOfInsertion":"11 April 2019","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6983613/","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"March 2015","accessionNumber":"14981378","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6983613/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"International Science and Technology Cooperation and Exchange Program of Sichuan Province, China","grantNumber":"2014HH0029"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002858","fundingName":"China Post-Doctoral Science Foundation","grantNumber":"2014M552336"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61472065, 61350110238, U1233108, U1333127, 61272525 and 61472065"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Enabling Efficient Multi-Keyword Ranked Search Over Encrypted Mobile Cloud Data Through Blind Storage","sourcePdf":"tetc-li-2371239-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.138798S","chronDate":"March  2015","xplore-pub-id":"6245516","isNumber":"7055204","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6245516","citationCount":"106","xplore-issue":"7055204","articleId":"6983613","onlineDate":"12 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6983616,"authors":[{"name":"Sung Ik Park","affiliation":["Broadcasting System Research Department, Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute, Daejeon, Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/11/7050389/6983616/park-2370111-small.gif","p":["Sung Ik Park (A\u201907\u2013M\u201908\u2013SM\u201913) received the B.S.E.E. degree from Hanyang University, Seoul, Korea, the M.S.E.E. degree from the Pohang University of Science and Technology, Pohang, Korea, and the Ph.D. degree from Chungnam National University, Daejeon, Korea, in 2000, 2002, and 2011, respectively.

Many attempts have been made to improve the performance of BIPT systems. In a typical BIPT system, the output power is controlled using the pickup converter phase shift angle, while the primary converter regulates the input current. This paper proposes an optimized phase-shift modulation strategy to minimize the coil losses of a series-series compensated BIPT system. In addition, a comprehensive study on the impact of power converters on the overall efficiency of the system is also presented. A closed-loop controller is proposed to optimize the overall efficiency of the BIPT system. Theoretical results are presented in comparison to both simulations and measurements of a 0.5 kW prototype to show the benefits of the proposed concept. Results convincingly demonstrate the applicability of the proposed system offering high efficiency over a wide range of output power.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6983618/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 December 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2015","volume":"30","issue":"11","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15289518","dateOfInsertion":"10 July 2015","publicationDate":"Nov. 2015","htmlLink":"/document/6983618/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"An Efficiency Optimization Scheme for Bidirectional Inductive Power Transfer Systems","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001475","fundingName":"Nanyang Technological University"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Efficiency Optimization Scheme for Bidirectional Inductive Power Transfer Systems","sourcePdf":"tpel-nguyen-2379676-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.121361S","chronDate":"Nov.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"7154538","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"103","xplore-issue":"7154538","articleId":"6983618","onlineDate":"12 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-23"},{"_id":6983622,"authors":[{"name":"Sean Huberman","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, McGill University, Montreal, QC, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/7323911/6983622/huber-2380775-small.gif","p":["\n\nSean Huberman (M'13) received the B.Sc. degree in engineering (first-class honours) from Queen's University, Kingston, ON, Canada, in 2008.

The problem formulation leads to a nonconvex matrix-variable optimization problem, where we develop two efficient sum-rate maximization algorithms using sequential convex programming (SCP), namely, the difference of convex functions (DC)-based and the sequential convex approximations for matrix-variable programming (SCAMP) algorithms. In addition, we derive the achievable sum rate under the effect of residual self-interference. Simulation results show that, even in cases of high self-interference and high estimation error, the SCAMP algorithm provides approximately 20%-30% sum-rate improvements over both conventional optimized half-duplex (HD) transmission and the existing state-of-the-art FD algorithm in a wide range of scenarios. Finally, the convergence results indicate that the DC-based algorithm tends to initially give the best performance; however, at convergence, the SCAMP algorithm tends to significantly outperform the other algorithms.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/7323911/06983622.pdf","startPage":"5103","endPage":"5112","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2014.2380775","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2014.2380775","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7323911","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6983622","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Full-Duplex MIMO Precoding for Sum-Rate Maximization With Sequential Convex Programming","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Approximation methods","High definition video","Optimization","Approximation algorithms","Linear programming","Interference","Downlink"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["approximation theory","concave programming","convex programming","matrix algebra","MIMO communication","multi-access systems","precoding","radiofrequency interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sum-rate maximization","sequential convex programming","residual self-interference","MU-MIMO FD system","multiuser multiple input multiple output full duplex system","precoding design","nonconvex matrix-variable optimization problem","SCP","difference of convex function","DC","sequential convex approximation","matrix-variable programming","SCAMP","half-duplex transmission","HD transmission"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Full-duplex","MIMO","precoding","sequential convex programming","non-convex optimization"]},{"kwd":["Full duplex (FD)","multiple-input\u2013multiple-output (MIMO)","nonconvex optimization","precoding","sequential convex programming (SCP)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6983622/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 December 2014","displayDocTitle":"Full-Duplex MIMO Precoding for Sum-Rate Maximization With Sequential Convex Programming","volume":"64","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/6983622/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2015","accessionNumber":"15587034","dateOfInsertion":"10 November 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"R&D Contract Advanced Transmission Multiple-Access Schemes for Future Radio Access from Huawei Technologies Canada"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Full-Duplex MIMO Precoding for Sum-Rate Maximization With Sequential Convex Programming","sourcePdf":"tvt-huberman-2380775-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.105732S","chronDate":"Nov.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"7323911","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"7323911","articleId":"6983622","onlineDate":"12 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6983623,"authors":[{"name":"Mugen Peng","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Universal Wireless Communications for Ministry of Education, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/7323911/6983623/peng-2379922-small.gif","p":["\n\nMugen Peng (M'05\u2013SM'11) received the B.E. degree in electronics engineering from Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Nanjing, China, in 2000 and the Ph.D. degree in communication and information system from Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (BUPT), Beijing, China, in 2005.","After completing the Ph.D. degree, he joined BUPT, where he has been a Full Professor with the School of Information and Communication Engineering since October 2012.

To mitigate the intertier interference and improve energy efficiency (EE) performances in H-CRANs, characterizing user association with RRH/HPN is considered in this paper, and the traditional soft fractional frequency reuse (S-FFR) is enhanced. Based on the RRH/HPN association constraint and the enhanced S-FFR, an energy-efficient optimization problem with the resource assignment and power allocation for the orthogonal-frequency-division-multiple-access-based H-CRANs is formulated as a nonconvex objective function. To deal with the nonconvexity, an equivalent convex feasibility problem is reformulated, and closed-form expressions for the energy-efficient resource allocation solution to jointly allocate the resource block and transmit power are derived by the Lagrange dual decomposition method. Simulation results confirm that the H-CRAN architecture and the corresponding resource allocation solution can enhance the EE significantly.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2014.2379922","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/7323911/06983623.pdf","startPage":"5275","endPage":"5287","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7323911","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2014.2379922","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy-Efficient Resource Assignment and Power Allocation in Heterogeneous Cloud Radio Access Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6983623","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2015","displayDocTitle":"Energy-Efficient Resource Assignment and Power Allocation in Heterogeneous Cloud Radio Access Networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6983623/","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"10 November 2015","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"15587045","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6983623/","volume":"64","issue":"11","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 December 2014","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61222103"},{"fundingName":"National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program)","grantNumber":"2013CB336600 and 2012CB316005"},{"fundingName":"State Major Science and Technology Special Projects","grantNumber":"2013ZX03001001"},{"fundingName":"Beijing Natural Science Foundation","grantNumber":"4131003"},{"fundingName":"Specialized Research Fund for the Doctoral Program of Higher Education (SRFDP)","grantNumber":"20120005140002"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61201174"},{"fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province","grantNumber":"BK2012325"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Energy-Efficient Resource Assignment and Power Allocation in Heterogeneous Cloud Radio Access Networks","sourcePdf":"tvt-peng-2379922-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.144151S","chronDate":"Nov.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"7323911","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"218","xplore-issue":"7323911","articleId":"6983623","onlineDate":"12 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6983635,"authors":[{"name":"Martin Saint-Laurent","affiliation":["Qualcomm Technologies, Inc., Austin, TX, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/6998099/6983635/6983635-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Martin Saint-Laurent (SM'09) received the B.Eng. degree (with honors) from McGill University, Montreal, Canada, and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees from the Georgia Institute of Technology (Georgia Tech), Atlanta, GA, USA, all in electrical engineering.","From 1998 to 2005, he was with Intel Corp., where he worked on two generations of high-frequency IA-32 processors as a custom circuit designer.

The main advantages of the proposed dispatch scheme are that it can reduce the impacts of wind power forecast errors while prolonging the lifetime of BESS. The scheme starts from the planning stage, where a BESS capacity determination method is proposed to compute the optimal power capacity and energy capacity of BESS based on historical wind power data; and then, at the operation stage, a flexible short-term BESS-wind farm dispatch scheme is proposed based on the forecasted wind power generation scenarios. Three case studies are provided to validate the performance of the proposed method. The results show that the proposed scheme can largely improve the wind farm dispatchability.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6983692/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2015","volume":"6","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","accessionNumber":"14824270","publicationDate":"Jan. 2015","htmlLink":"/document/6983692/","isStaticHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Coordinated Operational Planning for Wind Farm With Battery Energy Storage System","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"ARC","grantNumber":"LP110200957"},{"fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"71331001, 51277016 and 71401017"},{"fundingName":"State Key Laboratory of Alternate Electrical Power System with Renewable Energy Sources","grantNumber":"LAPS14002"},{"fundingName":"Fujian regional science and technology major projects, China","grantNumber":"2013H41010151"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Coordinated Operational Planning for Wind Farm With Battery Energy Storage System","sourcePdf":"tste-dong-2367550-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.094881S","chronDate":"Jan.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"5165391","isNumber":"6983670","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5165391","citationCount":"151","xplore-issue":"6983670","articleId":"6983692","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-26"},{"_id":6983804,"authors":[{"name":"Gil Bernabeu","affiliation":["GlobalPlatform, USA"],"firstName":"Gil","lastName":"Bernabeu","id":"37085588829"},{"name":"Eddie Jaffuel","affiliation":["eConsult, France"],"firstName":"Eddie","lastName":"Jaffuel","id":"37085586277"},{"name":"Bruno Legeard","affiliation":["Institut FEMTO-ST, France"],"firstName":"Bruno","lastName":"Legeard","id":"37937045200"},{"name":"Fabien Peureux","affiliation":["Institut FEMTO-ST, France"],"firstName":"Fabien","lastName":"Peureux","id":"37711948100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7377-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6983804","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":77},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Unified modeling language","Testing","Abstracts","Adaptation models","Standards","HTML","Documentation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["conformance testing","formal specification","open systems","program testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MBT","global platform compliance testing","compliant product vendor","model-based testing approach","smart sting solution","compliance test suites","global platform specifications","long-term interoperability","secure chip technology","global platform compliance program","global platform working group testing process"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Model-Based Testing","Compliance Test Suite","Global Platform","Operational Experiments Feedback"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6983804","doi":"10.1109/ISSREW.2014.91","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSREW.2014.91","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6983760","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Symposium on Software Reliability Engineering Workshops","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Symposium on Software Reliability Engineering Workshops","pdfPath":"/iel7/6982004/6983760/06983804.pdf","startPage":"66","endPage":"70","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MBT for Global Platform Compliance Testing: Experience Report and Lessons Learned","abstract":"Compliance testing is done to determine whether a system meets a specified standard prescribed by a given authority.

The high failure rates in their hardware and software components result in frequent node and application failures. Therefore, it is important to predict application failures before they occur to avoid resource wastage. In this paper, we investigate how to identify application failures based on resource usage measurements from the Google cluster traces. We apply recurrent neural networks to the resource usage measures, and generate features to categorize the input resource usage time series into different classes. Our results show that the model is able to predict failures of batch applications, which are the dominant jobs in the Google cluster. Moreover, we explore early classification to identify failures, and find that the prediction algorithm provides the cloud system enough time to take proactive actions much earlier than the termination of applications, with an average 6% to 10% of resource savings.","doi":"10.1109/ISSREW.2014.105","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Symposium on Software Reliability Engineering Workshops","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Symposium on Software Reliability Engineering Workshops","pdfPath":"/iel7/6982004/6983760/06983864.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSREW.2014.105","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6983760","startPage":"341","endPage":"346","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Failure Prediction of Jobs in Compute Clouds: A Google Cluster Case Study","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6983864","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Failure Prediction of Jobs in Compute Clouds: A Google Cluster Case Study","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 Nov. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6983864/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"3-6 Nov. 2014","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2014","accessionNumber":"14827843","dateOfInsertion":"15 December 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6983864/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Failure Prediction of Jobs in Compute Clouds: A Google Cluster Case Study","confLoc":"Naples, Italy","sourcePdf":"7377a341.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075252S","chronDate":"3-6 Nov. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6982004","isNumber":"6983760","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6982004","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"6983760","articleId":"6983864","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":6983871,"authors":[{"name":"Flavio Frattini","affiliation":["Universit\u00e0 degli Studi di Napoli Federico II, Italy"],"firstName":"Flavio","lastName":"Frattini","id":"37072644600"},{"name":"Santonu Sarkar","affiliation":["Universit\u00e0 degli Studi di Napoli Federico II, Italy"],"firstName":"Santonu","lastName":"Sarkar","id":"37085453638"},{"name":"Jyotiska Nath Khasnabish","affiliation":["BITS Pilani, K.K.Birla Goa Campus, India"],"firstName":"Jyotiska Nath","lastName":"Khasnabish","id":"37085457570"},{"name":"Stefano Russo","affiliation":["Intl.

Results show the rationality of the approach and discuss the impact of the invariant mining strategy on the detection capabilities, both in terms of accuracy and of time to reveal violations.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Using Invariants for Anomaly Detection: The Case Study of a SaaS Application","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Symposium on Software Reliability Engineering Workshops","doi":"10.1109/ISSREW.2014.57","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Symposium on Software Reliability Engineering Workshops","pdfPath":"/iel7/6982004/6983760/06983871.pdf","startPage":"383","endPage":"388","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSREW.2014.57","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6983760","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6983871","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6983871/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 Nov. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Using Invariants for Anomaly Detection: The Case Study of a SaaS Application","conferenceDate":"3-6 Nov. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6983871/","dateOfInsertion":"15 December 2014","publicationDate":"Nov. 2014","accessionNumber":"14834333","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Using Invariants for Anomaly Detection: The Case Study of a SaaS Application","confLoc":"Naples, Italy","sourcePdf":"7377a383.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.090625S","chronDate":"3-6 Nov. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6982004","isNumber":"6983760","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6982004","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6983760","articleId":"6983871","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6983882,"authors":[{"name":"Yongquan Yan","affiliation":["Department of Information Technology, Shanxi Professional College of Finance, Taiyuan, Shanxi, China","School of Computer Science and Technology, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yongquan","lastName":"Yan","id":"37085449110"},{"name":"Ping Guo","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Technology, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Ping","lastName":"Guo","id":"37320676800"},{"name":"Lifeng Liu","affiliation":["Department of Information Technology, Shanxi Professional College of Finance, Taiyuan, Shanxi, China"],"firstName":"Lifeng","lastName":"Liu","id":"37085448719"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7377-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6983882","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":157},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6983882","abstract":"Software aging has been observed in a long running software application. A technique named rejuvenation is proposed to counteract this problem. The key to the aging and rejuvenation problem is how to analyze/forecast the resource consumption of software system. In this paper, we propose a methodology of hybrid ARIMA and artificial neural networks to forecast resource consumption in an IIS web server which is a running commercial server and subjected to software aging. The proposed hybrid method consists of two steps. In the first step, an ARIMA model is used to analyze the linear component of the data. In the second step, an artificial neural network model is developed to model the residuals from ARIMA model. The results show that the proposed hybrid model can be a good trade-off to forecast resource consumption.","doi":"10.1109/ISSREW.2014.27","startPage":"437","endPage":"442","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Symposium on Software Reliability Engineering Workshops","pdfPath":"/iel7/6982004/6983760/06983882.pdf","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Symposium on Software Reliability Engineering Workshops","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSREW.2014.27","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6983760","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Novel Hybridization of Artificial Neural Networks and ARIMA Models for Forecasting Resource Consumption in an IIS Web Server","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Predictive models","Memory management","Artificial neural networks","Aging","Data models","Software","Autoregressive processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["autoregressive moving average processes","Internet","neural nets","software reliability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hybridization","software aging","long running software application","software rejuvenation","software system","hybrid ARIMA","resource consumption forecasting","IIS Web server","running commercial server","data linear component","artificial neural network model","autoregressive integrated moving average model"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Software aging","Hybrid model","Artificial neural network","ARIMA"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6983882/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 Nov. 2014","displayDocTitle":"A Novel Hybridization of Artificial Neural Networks and ARIMA Models for Forecasting Resource Consumption in an IIS Web Server","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6983882/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"15 December 2014","conferenceDate":"3-6 Nov. 2014","accessionNumber":"14827891","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel Hybridization of Artificial Neural Networks and ARIMA Models for Forecasting Resource Consumption in an IIS Web Server","confLoc":"Naples, Italy","sourcePdf":"7377a437.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07181S","chronDate":"3-6 Nov. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6982004","isNumber":"6983760","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6982004","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6983760","articleId":"6983882","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":6983911,"authors":[{"name":"J.

We use generalized singular value decomposition and transform the problem to a concave maximization problem which maximizes the sum secrecy rate of scalar wiretap channels subject to linear constraints on the transmit covariance matrix. We then consider the MIMO wiretap channel with finite-alphabet input. We show that the transmit covariance matrix obtained for the case of Gaussian input, when used in the MIMO wiretap channel with finite-alphabet input, can lead to zero secrecy rate at high transmit powers.

It has been proposed in the literature that, if the carrier frequency information of a multiband signal is not known apriori, then we require a minimum sampling rate of 2NB for perfect reconstruction. Modulated wideband converter (MWC) is a recently introduced blind sampling method. Unlike the traditional sampling methods, where the continuous-time signal can be expressed in terms of samples using simple Whittaker-Shannon interpolation, there is no closed-form expression relating the samples generated by MWC and the continuous-time signal. In order to reconstruct the signal, we require compressive sensing (CS) algorithm. The CS algorithm, simultaneous orthogonal matching pursuit (SOMP) used in the reconstruction stage requires a minimum rate of 4N B log(M/2N), which is nearly twice the theoretical rate. In this paper, we propose a new greedy algorithm, which exploits the clustered sparse structure of the multiband signals to sample at near-theoretical rates. The simulation results supporting the better performance of our algorithm are also presented.","doi":"10.1109/SPCOM.2014.6983943","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPCOM.2014.6983943","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 International Conference on Signal Processing and Communications (SPCOM)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6963209/6983903/06983943.pdf","publicationTitle":"2014 International Conference on Signal Processing and Communications (SPCOM)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6983903","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new approach to near-theoretical sampling rate for modulated wideband converter","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"22-25 July 2014","displayDocTitle":"A new approach to near-theoretical sampling rate for modulated wideband converter","conferenceDate":"22-25 July 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2014","dateOfInsertion":"15 December 2014","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6983943/","accessionNumber":"14826560","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6983943/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new approach to near-theoretical sampling rate for modulated wideband converter","confLoc":"Bangalore, India","sourcePdf":"1569899973.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057003S","chronDate":"22-25 July 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6963209","isNumber":"6983903","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6963209","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6983903","articleId":"6983943","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6983947,"authors":[{"name":"Yuval Cassuto","affiliation":["Dept. of Electrical Engineering., Technion-Israel Institute of Tech., Haifa, Israel"],"firstName":"Yuval","lastName":"Cassuto","id":"37283988600"},{"name":"Shahar Kvatinsky","affiliation":["Dept. of Electrical Engineering., Technion-Israel Institute of Tech., Haifa, Israel"],"firstName":"Shahar","lastName":"Kvatinsky","id":"37601405900"},{"name":"Eitan Yaakobi","affiliation":["Dept. of Electrical Engineering., Technion-Israel Institute of Tech., Haifa, Israel"],"firstName":"Eitan","lastName":"Yaakobi","id":"37546078500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-4665-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-4666-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2165-0608"}],"articleNumber":"6983947","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":168},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Error probability","Memristors","Resistance","Reliability","Encoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel capacity","integrated circuit modelling","memristors","random-access storage"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sneak-path errors","resistive RAMs","memristor arrays","nonvolatile media","crossbar layout","cell-to-cell interference","cell readout","electric paths","crossbar cells","current bit assignment","single-parameter information theoretic channel","array dimensions","channel capacity","transition probability","time 0 s to 1 s"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Memristors","resistive memories","storage channels","inter-cell interference","coding for storage"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6983947","abstract":"Memristors, also known as resistive RAMs, are very promising non-volatile media that can be packed in unprecedented density.

In particular, cell readout is affected by sneak paths, which are electric paths passing through other crossbar cells and affecting the outcome of the read operation. The existence of sneak paths and their severity depends upon the current bit assignment stored in the array. In this paper we study sneak-path errors by modeling the array as a single-parameter information theoretic channel. We calculate this parameter in closed form as a function of the array dimensions and the bias between 0s and 1s in the written bits. We extend this result to the case where error occurs only when at least L sneak-paths exist, and also examine the correlation between sneak-path errors in different cells within the array. The channel capacity is calculated in a flavor similar to the capacity of the Z channel, only with transition probability that depends on the array-bit distribution.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6983903","publicationTitle":"2014 International Conference on Signal Processing and Communications (SPCOM)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 International Conference on Signal Processing and Communications (SPCOM)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6963209/6983903/06983947.pdf","doi":"10.1109/SPCOM.2014.6983947","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPCOM.2014.6983947","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the channel induced by sneak-path errors in memristor arrays","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"22-25 July 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6983947/","displayDocTitle":"On the channel induced by sneak-path errors in memristor arrays","htmlLink":"/document/6983947/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"22-25 July 2014","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"14833388","dateOfInsertion":"15 December 2014","publicationDate":"July 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the channel induced by sneak-path errors in memristor arrays","confLoc":"Bangalore, India","sourcePdf":"1569962493.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071S","chronDate":"22-25 July 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6963209","isNumber":"6983903","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6963209","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6983903","articleId":"6983947","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6983950,"authors":[{"name":"Anuradha Pandey","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, National Institute of Technology, Calicut, Kerala, India"],"firstName":"Anuradha","lastName":"Pandey","id":"37085459016"},{"name":"P.

The proposed scheme can be viewed as a two level precoding in the sense that the second level precoding is designed to optimize the first one. The first level precoder for the CR user is designed by selecting the notched frequencies from the out of band region that are very close to temporarily allocated spectrum for the CR user. In the second level, an optimization onto the first level precoded data is performed by using a precoder designed with notched frequencies which are spaced far away from the CR user band. Results of extensive simulation studies demonstrate that the proposed technique can suppress the OOBR significantly at a cost of very small degradation in bit error rate (BER) performance of secondary users.","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 International Conference on Signal Processing and Communications (SPCOM)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6963209/6983903/06983950.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"2014 International Conference on Signal Processing and Communications (SPCOM)","doi":"10.1109/SPCOM.2014.6983950","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPCOM.2014.6983950","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6983903","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6983950","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Two level precoding scheme for out of band radiation reduction in multiuser OFDM based cognitive radio","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Bit error rate","Optimization","Interference","Degradation","Frequency modulation","Shape"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","error statistics","OFDM modulation","precoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["two level precoding scheme","out of band radiation suppression scheme","multiuser OFDM based cognitive radio","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","spectral precoder","optimization scheme","OOBR","CR user band","bit error rate","spectrum allocation","BER"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cognitive radio (CR)","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM)","out of band radiation (OOBR)","two level precoder"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6983950/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-25 July 2014","displayDocTitle":"Two level precoding scheme for out of band radiation reduction in multiuser OFDM based cognitive radio","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6983950/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2014","accessionNumber":"14833393","dateOfInsertion":"15 December 2014","conferenceDate":"22-25 July 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Two level precoding scheme for out of band radiation reduction in multiuser OFDM based cognitive radio","confLoc":"Bangalore, India","sourcePdf":"1569899709.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070205S","chronDate":"22-25 July 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6963209","isNumber":"6983903","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6963209","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6983903","articleId":"6983950","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-19"},{"_id":6983956,"authors":[{"name":"Kedar Kulkarni","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur, Kanpur, INDIA"],"firstName":"Kedar","lastName":"Kulkarni","id":"38247096000"},{"name":"Adrish Banerjee","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur, Kanpur, INDIA"],"firstName":"Adrish","lastName":"Banerjee","id":"37274348500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-4665-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-4666-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2165-0608"}],"articleNumber":"6983956","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":143},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6983956","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Throughput","Joints","Interference","Signal to noise ratio","Receivers","Stability analysis","Transmitters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive mode selection","time spreading","joint interweave-underlay mode","spectrum allocation","primary user queue stability constraint","secondary user","cognitive radio system","adaptive transmission strategies"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cognitive radio","Stable throughput","Time spreading","Queue stability"]}],"doi":"10.1109/SPCOM.2014.6983956","publicationTitle":"2014 International Conference on Signal Processing and Communications (SPCOM)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 International Conference on Signal Processing and Communications (SPCOM)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6963209/6983903/06983956.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPCOM.2014.6983956","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6983903","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive transmission strategies to maximize packet throughput of cognitive radio under primary user queue stability constraint","abstract":"In a cognitive radio system, secondary user should use spectrum allocated to primary user in such a way that primary user's quality of service is maintained at all times. In a system where primary user stores packets in a queue for transmission, the queue's stability has to be ensured. We consider joint interweave-underlay mode where secondary user transmits when primary user is absent and also when primary user is present, by adopting its transmit power to keep interference to primary below a threshold. We compare the performance of joint interweave-underlay mode with only-interweave mode. We also use a technique of adaptively spreading packets in time to increase received signal to interference plus noise ratio which increases achievable packet throughput. By comparing only-interweave mode with combination of joint interweave-underlay mode and time spreading, we propose adaptive mode selection to select the mode that gives higher average packet throughput for secondary user while keeping primary queue stable. We present simulation results and analyze proposed method for different channel conditions.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"22-25 July 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6983956/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"14826556","publicationDate":"July 2014","conferenceDate":"22-25 July 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6983956/","dateOfInsertion":"15 December 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive transmission strategies to maximize packet throughput of cognitive radio under primary user queue stability constraint","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive transmission strategies to maximize packet throughput of cognitive radio under primary user queue stability constraint","confLoc":"Bangalore, India","sourcePdf":"1569900115.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067099S","chronDate":"22-25 July 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6963209","isNumber":"6983903","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6963209","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6983903","articleId":"6983956","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6983957,"authors":[{"name":"Raghu Ganesan","affiliation":["Wireless Connectivity Solutions, Texas Instruments, India"],"firstName":"Raghu","lastName":"Ganesan","id":"37582301600"},{"name":"Sarma Gunturi","affiliation":["Wireless Connectivity Solutions, Texas Instruments, India"],"firstName":"Sarma","lastName":"Gunturi","id":"37400875300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-4665-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-4666-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2165-0608"}],"articleNumber":"6983957","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":533},"abstract":"In a receiver for multiple input multiple output (MIMO) 802.11n system, the residual carrier frequency offset (CFO), after synchronization with training symbols in the preamble of a packet, affects the accuracy of channel estimation. The residual CFO causes inter-carrier interference as well as inter-spatial stream interference. A decision directed algorithm to estimate and correct the residual CFO before channel estimation is presented. A 802.11n packet transmitted with high-throughput mixed mode (HT-MM) packet format has both legacy and high-throughput (HT) training fields. Typically, the channel is estimated only with HT training fields. In this paper, a channel estimation technique which uses both the legacy and high-throughput training field is proposed. Simulation results demonstrating the improvement in channel estimation and packet error rate (PER) performance are also presented.","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 International Conference on Signal Processing and Communications (SPCOM)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6963209/6983903/06983957.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"2014 International Conference on Signal Processing and Communications (SPCOM)","doi":"10.1109/SPCOM.2014.6983957","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPCOM.2014.6983957","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6983903","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6983957","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust channel estimation for 802.11n (MIMO-OFDM) systems","keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","intercarrier interference","MIMO communication","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["robust channel estimation","multiple input multiple output 802.11n system","MIMO-OFDM systems","residual carrier frequency offset","CFO","inter-carrier interference","inter-spatial stream interference","decision directed algorithm","high-throughput mixed mode packet format","HT-MM packet format","packet error rate","PER"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6983957/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-25 July 2014","displayDocTitle":"Robust channel estimation for 802.11n (MIMO-OFDM) systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6983957/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2014","accessionNumber":"14826589","dateOfInsertion":"15 December 2014","conferenceDate":"22-25 July 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust channel estimation for 802.11n (MIMO-OFDM) systems","confLoc":"Bangalore, India","sourcePdf":"1569899697.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054429S","chronDate":"22-25 July 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6963209","isNumber":"6983903","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6963209","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6983903","articleId":"6983957","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":6983959,"authors":[{"name":"Dileep Kumar Verma","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Delhi, New Delhi"],"firstName":"Dileep Kumar","lastName":"Verma","id":"37853119700"},{"name":"Shankar Prakriya","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Delhi, New Delhi"],"firstName":"Shankar","lastName":"Prakriya","id":"37281591400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-4665-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-4666-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2165-0608"}],"articleNumber":"6983959","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":60},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Signal to noise ratio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","probability","radio receivers","radiofrequency interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["symbiotic dynamic spectrum access system","outage performance","secondary selection schemes","DSA system","primary signal","signal-to-noise-ratio","SNR","primary receiver","peak interference tolerance limit","ITL","peak interference constraints","peak secondary transmit power","asymptotic outage probability","primary relay","cellular network"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we analyze the outage performance of secondary selection schemes in a symbiotic dynamic spectrum access (DSA) system. In this system, one opportunistically selected secondary node relays the primary signal for boosting the signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) at the primary receiver, so as to raise the peak interference tolerance limit (ITL) of the primary receiver. This enables the secondary base station to simultaneously communicate to another opportunistically selected secondary node. Assuming peak secondary transmit power and peak interference constraints, we derive the exact and asymptotic outage probability of secondary system in such a framework for simple selection schemes.

Selective mapping (SLM) is an efficient technique to reduce PAPR in OFDM without causing signal distortion. However SLM has high system complexity since it requires large number of inverse fast Fourier transform (IFFT) operations. And also it demands the transmission of side information for each data block which results in huge bandwidth overhead. In this paper, we propose an improved SLM technique with either Gold or Hadamard code which ensures low system complexity to achieve the same PAPR reduction performance as that of conventional SLM. Also the proposed SLM method promises superior PAPR reduction compared to that of conventional SLM for identical system complexities. Moreover, the proposed SLM approach needs less side information to be send to the receiver resulting in improved bandwidth efficiency. Simulation studies show that considerable reduction in PAPR than conventional SLM method is achieved for identical number of multiplying phase sequences. The effect of non-linear distortion caused by high PAPR is also studied and the proposed method is shown to ensure linear operation over a large dynamic range of high power amplifier (HPA) in an OFDM transmitter.","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 International Conference on Signal Processing and Communications (SPCOM)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6963209/6983903/06983972.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2014 International Conference on Signal Processing and Communications (SPCOM)","doi":"10.1109/SPCOM.2014.6983972","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPCOM.2014.6983972","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6983903","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6983972","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An improved technique to reduce peak to average power ratio in OFDM systems using gold/hadamard codes with selective mapping","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Peak to average power ratio","Gold","Error correction","Error correction codes","Nonlinear distortion","Complexity theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Fourier transforms","Gold codes","Hadamard codes","inverse transforms","nonlinear distortion","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["peak to average power ratio","OFDM systems","selective mapping","frequency selective channels","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing system","PAPR","signal distortion","inverse fast Fourier transform","IFFT","improved SLM technique","Hadamard code","Gold code","phase sequences","nonlinear distortion","high power amplifier"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM)","peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR)","high power amplifier (HPA)","complementary cumulative distribution function (CCDF)","selective mapping method (SLM)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6983972/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-25 July 2014","displayDocTitle":"An improved technique to reduce peak to average power ratio in OFDM systems using gold/hadamard codes with selective mapping","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6983972/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2014","accessionNumber":"14826609","dateOfInsertion":"15 December 2014","conferenceDate":"22-25 July 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An improved technique to reduce peak to average power ratio in OFDM systems using gold/hadamard codes with selective mapping","confLoc":"Bangalore, India","sourcePdf":"1569899813.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055069S","chronDate":"22-25 July 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6963209","isNumber":"6983903","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6963209","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6983903","articleId":"6983972","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6983974,"authors":[{"name":"Dipanjan Nandi","affiliation":["School of Information Technology, Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur, India"],"firstName":"Dipanjan","lastName":"Nandi","id":"38233252500"},{"name":"Debadatta Pati","affiliation":["Dept. of Electronics & Comm.

Dirty paper coding (DPC) meets these conditions, but its practical implementation is very complex. Tomlinson-Harashima precoding (THP) ensures interference-free communication to the users like DPC, with very little increase in the transmitted power, and its implementation is much less complex compared to that of DPC. Block diagonalization based precoding also meets these conditions, but at the cost of increased number of antennas at the transmitter, and the increase depends on the number of antennas of the users. In the downlink MU-MIMO with THP, it is known that the transmitter with N\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">t</sub>\n antennas can serve N\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">t</sub>\n users, with each user having one antenna, thereby transmitting one stream of symbols (we refer to this as one layer) to each user.

In the process of the tree search a number of possible transmitted symbols are searched and the error performance of the K-best detection depends on this number. More the number of visited symbols, better the error performance. However this relationship is not straightforward and needs to be analyzed. In this paper, a tight upper bound on the error performance of K-best detection for MIMO systems with linear modulation scheme has been derived. In particular upper bounds for M-ary pulse amplitude modulation (M-PAM) and for 4-ary quadrature amplitude modulation (4-QAM) with Rayleigh fading channel have been established. This upper bound requires the K-best error performance for single-input singleoutput (SISO) systems. Hence we first derive an exact expression for M-PAM as well as for 4-QAM with K-best detection for SISO systems and use this to establish the upper bound. Finally we compare the derived upper bound with the simulations. It is found that the upper bound is close to the results obtained through simulations.","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 International Conference on Signal Processing and Communications (SPCOM)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6963209/6983903/06983985.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"2014 International Conference on Signal Processing and Communications (SPCOM)","doi":"10.1109/SPCOM.2014.6983985","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPCOM.2014.6983985","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6983903","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6983985","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An upper bound on the performance of K-best detection for MIMO systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Upper bound","MIMO","Vectors","Modulation","Fading","Antennas","Noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO communication","modulation","pulse amplitude modulation","quadrature amplitude modulation","Rayleigh channels","tree searching"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["K-best detection","MIMO systems","breadth first tree search detection technique","multiple input multiple output systems","error performance","linear modulation scheme","M-ary pulse amplitude modulation","M-PAM","4-QAM","Rayleigh fading channel","single-input single output systems"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6983985/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-25 July 2014","displayDocTitle":"An upper bound on the performance of K-best detection for MIMO systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6983985/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2014","accessionNumber":"14826563","dateOfInsertion":"15 December 2014","conferenceDate":"22-25 July 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An upper bound on the performance of K-best detection for MIMO systems","confLoc":"Bangalore, India","sourcePdf":"1569901387.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048871S","chronDate":"22-25 July 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6963209","isNumber":"6983903","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6963209","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6983903","articleId":"6983985","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":6983986,"authors":[{"name":"Raaz Dwivedi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, IIT Bombay, Mumbai, India"],"firstName":"Raaz","lastName":"Dwivedi","id":"37085583724"},{"name":"Vivek S.

Traffic offloaded to the femtocells reduces spectrum usage of the macro/micro cell. The macrocell bandwidth saved in this way can be used to add extra new users into the system. The co-channel deployment of femtocells increases the frequency reuse by several folds; thereby improving overall Area Spectral Efficiency (ASE). In this work, the capacity increase in macro/micro cell due to femtocell deployment is analyzed for co-channel macro/micro-femto cell network. Performance variations of a LTE-Femtocell network with the number of femtocells and their Radio Access Network (RAN) parameters, namely, load and transmit power, is also presented which provide operational guidelines for heterogeneous network. The guidelines are derived with the system deployment objectives of maximizing sum-cell-throughput and maximizing total number of users in the system subject to satisfaction of a minimum throughput for each user. The congruity of the two objectives is also discussed.

The pilot correlation is exploited to detect the presence of a primary signal based on its cyclostationary properties. The performance of such detector relies on the exact value of the cyclostationary frequency of the signal of interest. However, in actual cases an offset may be caused in the cyclic frequency due to various reasons.

However, in orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) systems, allocation of an optimum frequency subband based on the minimum interference present in all the available subbands, can improve the performance of femtocells considerably. This paper presents an energy based analysis related to the subband allocation considering the asynchronization effects of interfering signals occurring due to the propagation delays and timing offsets in the network.

It is assumed in TWR that a user has data to send and receive from the base station (BS) at the same time. This paper considers a non-simultaneous traffic scenario observed in cellular systems, where one user sends data to the BS and another user receives data from the BS. We consider a novel multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) TWR protocol to enable communication between two users and the BS in two channel uses. By designing a linear precoder at the decode-and-forward RS, we maximize the sum-rate of this protocol by formulating a sequence of semidefinite programs. The sum-rate performance of this protocol is evaluated in two coverage-limited scenarios in a cellular framework by extensive numerical simulations. It is shown that the protocol results in a dramatic performance gain over conventional protocols.","doi":"10.1109/SPCOM.2014.6984005","publicationTitle":"2014 International Conference on Signal Processing and Communications (SPCOM)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 International Conference on Signal Processing and Communications (SPCOM)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6963209/6983903/06984005.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPCOM.2014.6984005","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6983903","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Two-way MIMO DF relaying for non-simultaneous traffic in cellular systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6984005","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-25 July 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6984005/","displayDocTitle":"Two-way MIMO DF relaying for non-simultaneous traffic in cellular systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2014","accessionNumber":"14833394","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6984005/","conferenceDate":"22-25 July 2014","dateOfInsertion":"15 December 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Two-way MIMO DF relaying for non-simultaneous traffic in cellular systems","confLoc":"Bangalore, India","sourcePdf":"1569889571.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.079512S","chronDate":"22-25 July 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6963209","isNumber":"6983903","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6963209","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6983903","articleId":"6984005","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6984006,"authors":[{"name":"Pooja Vyavahare","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, IIT Bombay"],"firstName":"Pooja","lastName":"Vyavahare","id":"37085448195"},{"name":"Akhil Shetty","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, IIT Bombay"],"firstName":"Akhil","lastName":"Shetty","id":"37085593179"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-4665-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-4666-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2165-0608"}],"articleNumber":"6984006","dbTime":"19 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":119},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Heuristic algorithms","Communication networks","Distributed databases","Algorithm design and analysis","Partitioning algorithms","Query processing","Time complexity"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","directed graphs","distributed processing","integer programming","quadratic programming","query processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimal embeddings","distributed computation","arbitrary functions","weighted directed acyclic graph","DAG","distributed system","distributed query processing","distributed software design","quadratic integer program","polynomial-time algorithm","NP-hard problem"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["In-network computation","Directed acyclic graphs","Quadratic Integer Program"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On optimal embeddings for distributed computation of arbitrary functions","doi":"10.1109/SPCOM.2014.6984006","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6983903","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2014 International Conference on Signal Processing and Communications (SPCOM)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 International Conference on Signal Processing and Communications (SPCOM)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6963209/6983903/06984006.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPCOM.2014.6984006","startPage":"1","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6984006","abstract":"We consider optimal embedding of weighted directed acyclic graph (DAG), representing the sequence of computation steps to evaluate a function of distributed data, on an arbitrary undirected weighted graph that represents a distributed system.

The advantage of SRC with the proposed learned-exemplar dictionary over that with simple-exemplar dictionary is also highlighted.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6984012/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-25 July 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2014","dateOfInsertion":"15 December 2014","accessionNumber":"14826576","htmlLink":"/document/6984012/","conferenceDate":"22-25 July 2014","displayDocTitle":"Sparse representation based tracking of frequency hopping primary user for cognitive radio","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sparse representation based tracking of frequency hopping primary user for cognitive radio","confLoc":"Bangalore, India","sourcePdf":"1569899347.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.106979S","chronDate":"22-25 July 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6963209","isNumber":"6983903","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6963209","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6983903","articleId":"6984012","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":6984057,"authors":[{"name":"Kostas Giotis","affiliation":["Network Management & Optimal Design Laboratory (NETMODE) School of Electrical & Computer Engineering National Technical University of Athens (NTUA), Athens, Greece"],"firstName":"Kostas","lastName":"Giotis","id":"37085390773"},{"name":"Georgios Androulidakis","affiliation":["Network Management & Optimal Design Laboratory (NETMODE) School of Electrical & Computer Engineering National Technical University of Athens (NTUA), Athens, Greece"],"firstName":"Georgios","lastName":"Androulidakis","id":"37827782300"},{"name":"Vasilis Maglaris","affiliation":["Network Management & Optimal Design Laboratory (NETMODE) School of Electrical & Computer Engineering National Technical University of Athens (NTUA), Athens, Greece"],"firstName":"Vasilis","lastName":"Maglaris","id":"37297047700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6919-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2379-0350"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-0369"}],"articleNumber":"6984057","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":37,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1590},"abstract":"In this paper, we investigate the applicability of Software-Defined Networking (SDN), and specifically the use of the OpenFlow protocol as a means to enhance the legacy Remote Triggered Black-Hole (RTBH) routing approach, towards Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack mitigation. More specifically, we exploit the network programmability of OpenFlow to match and handle traffic on a per-flow level, in order to preserve normal operation of the victim, while pushing the mitigation process upstream towards the edge of the network. To this end, we implemented and evaluated a sketch-based anomaly detection and identification mechanism, capable of pinpointing the victim and remotely triggering the mitigation of the offending network traffic. The evaluation is based on the combination of datasets containing real DDoS attacks and normal background traffic from an operational university campus network. Our results demonstrated that the proposed approach succeeds in identifying the victim of the attack and efficiently filtering the malicious sources.","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 Third European Workshop on Software Defined Networks","pdfPath":"/iel7/6979379/6984033/06984057.pdf","startPage":"85","endPage":"90","publicationTitle":"2014 Third European Workshop on Software Defined Networks","doi":"10.1109/EWSDN.2014.24","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EWSDN.2014.24","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6984033","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6984057","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Leveraging SDN for Efficient Anomaly Detection and Mitigation on Legacy Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Switches","IP networks","Computer crime","Protocols","Telecommunication traffic","Radiation detectors","Image edge detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer network security","routing protocols","software defined networking"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["SDN","software-defined networking","anomaly detection","legacy networks","OpenFlow protocol","remote triggered black-hole routing","RTBH routing","distributed denial of service","DDoS attack mitigation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Software Defined Networking","SDN","OpenFlow","sFlow","Anomaly Detection","RTBH","DDoS","Attack Mitigation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6984057/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 Sept. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Leveraging SDN for Efficient Anomaly Detection and Mitigation on Legacy Networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6984057/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","accessionNumber":"14827513","dateOfInsertion":"15 December 2014","conferenceDate":"1-3 Sept. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Leveraging SDN for Efficient Anomaly Detection and Mitigation on Legacy Networks","confLoc":"Budapest, Hungary","sourcePdf":"6919a085.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059144S","chronDate":"1-3 Sept. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6979379","isNumber":"6984033","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6979379","citationCount":"37","xplore-issue":"6984033","articleId":"6984057","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6984117,"authors":[{"name":"J\u00e1come Cunha","affiliation":["Universidade do Minho, Braga, Braga, PT"],"firstName":"J\u00e1come","lastName":"Cunha","id":"37605169700"},{"name":"Jo\u00e3o Paulo Fernandes","affiliation":["Universidade do Minho, Braga, Braga, PT"],"firstName":"Jo\u00e3o Paulo","lastName":"Fernandes","id":"37272143500"},{"name":"Pedro Martins","affiliation":["Universidade do Minho, Braga, Braga, PT"],"firstName":"Pedro","lastName":"Martins","id":"38274147800"},{"name":"Rui Pereira","affiliation":["Universidade do Minho, Braga, Braga, PT"],"firstName":"Rui","lastName":"Pereira","id":"38592112700"},{"name":"Jo\u00e3o Saraiva","affiliation":["Universidade do Minho, Braga, Braga, PT"],"firstName":"Jo\u00e3o","lastName":"Saraiva","id":"37287527500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6133-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-6132-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6984117","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":66},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Indexes","Unified modeling language","Object oriented modeling","Biological system modeling","Software","Data models","Business"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["software maintenance","software quality","spreadsheet programs"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["synchronization","automatic data evolution","spreadsheet model quality improvement","object-oriented method","business logic","ClassSheets modeling language","software quality improvement","software artifacts","software refactoring","model-driven spreadsheet evolution"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["refactoring","model-driven spreadsheets","classsheets"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6984117","doi":"10.1109/QUATIC.2014.34","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/QUATIC.2014.34","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6984078","publicationTitle":"2014 9th International Conference on the Quality of Information and Communications Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 9th International Conference on the Quality of Information and Communications Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/6979349/6984078/06984117.pdf","startPage":"196","endPage":"201","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Refactoring Meets Model-Driven Spreadsheet Evolution","abstract":"Software refactoring is a well-known technique that provides transformations on software artifacts with the aim of improving their overall quality.

In this paper we focus our attention on the integration of Cloud and IoT, which we call the CloudIoT paradigm. Many works in literature have surveyed Cloud and IoT separately: their main properties, features, underlying technologies, and open issues. However, to the best of our knowledge, these works lack a detailed analysis of the CloudIoT paradigm. To bridge this gap, in this paper we review the literature about the integration of Cloud and IoT. We start analyzing and discussing the need for integrating them, the challenges deriving from such integration, and how these issues have been tackled in literature. We then describe application scenarios that have been presented in literature, as well as platforms -- both commercial and open source -- and projects implementing the CloudIoT paradigm. Finally, we identify open issues, main challenges and future directions in this promising field.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6984170/","conferenceDate":"27-29 Aug. 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 Aug. 2014","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"14827948","dateOfInsertion":"15 December 2014","publicationDate":"Aug. 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6984170/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"On the Integration of Cloud Computing and Internet of Things","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Integration of Cloud Computing and Internet of Things","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"4357a023.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.156412S","chronDate":"27-29 Aug. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6982600","isNumber":"6984143","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6982600","citationCount":"291","xplore-issue":"6984143","articleId":"6984170","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-22"},{"_id":6984208,"authors":[{"name":"Stefan Nastic","affiliation":["Distributed Systems Group, Vienna University of Technology, Austria"],"firstName":"Stefan","lastName":"Nastic","id":"38529171600"},{"name":"Sanjin Sehic","affiliation":["Technische Universitat Wien, Wien, Wien, AT"],"firstName":"Sanjin","lastName":"Sehic"},{"name":"Duc-Hung Le","affiliation":["Distributed Systems Group, Vienna University of Technology, Austria"],"firstName":"Duc-Hung","lastName":"Le","id":"37085394739"},{"name":"Hong-Linh Truong","affiliation":["Distributed Systems Group, Vienna University of Technology, Austria"],"firstName":"Hong-Linh","lastName":"Truong","id":"37301402000"},{"name":"Schahram Dustdar","affiliation":["Distributed Systems Group, Vienna University of Technology, Austria"],"firstName":"Schahram","lastName":"Dustdar","id":"37085372742"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-4357-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6984208","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":80,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":4072},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Provisioning Software-Defined IoT Cloud Systems","abstract":"Cloud computing is ever stronger converging with the Internet of Things (IoT) offering novel techniques for IoT infrastructure virtualization and its management on the cloud.

In this paper, we introduce the concept of software-defined IoT units - a novel approach to IoT cloud computing that encapsulates fine-grained IoT resources and IoT capabilities in well-defined APIs in order to provide a unified view on accessing, configuring and operating IoT cloud systems. Our software-defined IoT units are the fundamental building blocks of software-defined IoT cloud systems. We present our framework for dynamic, on-demand provisioning and deploying such software-defined IoT cloud systems. By automating provisioning processes and supporting managed configuration models, our framework simplifies provisioning and enables flexible runtime customizations of software-defined IoT cloud systems.

Nevertheless, a bigger evolution of the Cloud is yet to come by means of new applications and improvements but also with the combination of other arising technologies, resulting in a huge advance as part of the Future Internet. The next step of the Future Internet in the next few years is to get every single device connected at any-time and in any-place with any other device. Moreover, Wireless Sensor Networks offer a technology for monitoring and networking that is low power and low cost which is the basic layer in a world of things interconnected. The combination of Wireless Sensor Networks and Cloud Computing will enable unprecedented opportunities in the Future Internet that will include physical devices. This paper presents a new framework that simplifies the integration of Wireless Sensor Networks in the Cloud. The approach is highly reconfigurable, self-managed and takes into account real-time requirements. The basic idea of the framework is the concept of Virtual Channels, which exchange messages between every single device and the Cloud. The framework then publishes a \"virtual sensor\" service representing one or more physical sensors.","doi":"10.1109/FiCloud.2014.59","startPage":"334","endPage":"339","publicationTitle":"2014 International Conference on Future Internet of Things and Cloud","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FiCloud.2014.59","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6984143","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 International Conference on Future Internet of Things and Cloud","pdfPath":"/iel7/6982600/6984143/06984215.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Virtual Channel-Based Framework for the Integration of Wireless Sensor Networks in the Cloud","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6984215/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Virtual Channel-Based Framework for the Integration of Wireless Sensor Networks in the Cloud","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6984215/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"14834344","publicationDate":"Aug. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"15 December 2014","conferenceDate":"27-29 Aug. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 Aug. 2014","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Virtual Channel-Based Framework for the Integration of Wireless Sensor Networks in the Cloud","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"4357a334.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044633S","chronDate":"27-29 Aug. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6982600","isNumber":"6984143","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6982600","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"6984143","articleId":"6984215","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-17"},{"_id":6984222,"authors":[{"name":"Hajar Mousannif","affiliation":["LISI Lab., FSSM Cadi Ayyad Univ., Marrakesh, Morocco"],"firstName":"Hajar","lastName":"Mousannif"},{"name":"Hasna Sabah","affiliation":["OSER research team, FSTG Cadi Ayyad University, Marrakesh, Morocco"],"firstName":"Hasna","lastName":"Sabah","id":"37085499383"},{"name":"Yasmina Douiji","affiliation":["OSER research team, FSTG Cadi Ayyad University, Marrakesh, Morocco"],"firstName":"Yasmina","lastName":"Douiji","id":"37085479864"},{"name":"Younes Oulad Sayad","affiliation":["OSER research team, FSTG Cadi Ayyad University, Marrakesh, Morocco"],"firstName":"Younes Oulad","lastName":"Sayad","id":"37085480460"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-4357-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6984222","dbTime":"21 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":17,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1510},"doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FiCloud.2014.66","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6984143","publicationTitle":"2014 International Conference on Future Internet of Things and Cloud","startPage":"373","endPage":"378","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 International Conference on Future Internet of Things and Cloud","pdfPath":"/iel7/6982600/6984143/06984222.pdf","doi":"10.1109/FiCloud.2014.66","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"From Big Data to Big Projects: A Step-by-Step Roadmap","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Big data","Companies","Data visualization","Security","Buildings"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Big Data","data analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data-driven roadmap","analytical roadmap","opinion-operated era","Big Data analytics"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["big data","advanced analytics","big data project","big data technologies"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6984222","abstract":"While technologies to build and run big data projects have started to mature and proliferate over the last couple of years, exploiting all potentials of big data is still at a relatively early stage. In fact, building effective big data projects inside organizations is hindered by the lack of a clear data-driven and analytical roadmap to move businesses and organizations from an opinion-operated era where humans skills are a necessity to a data-driven and smart era where big data analytics plays a major role in discovering unexpected insights in the oceans of data routinely generated or collected. This paper provides a solid and well-founded methodology for organizations to build big data projects and reap the most rewards out of their data. It covers all aspects of big data project implementation, from data collection to final project evaluation. In each stage of the process, we introduce different sets of platforms and tools in order to assist IT professionals and managers in gaining a comprehensive understanding of the methods and technologies involved and in making the best use of them. We also complete the picture by illustrating the process through different real-world big data projects implementations.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6984222/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 Aug. 2014","conferenceDate":"27-29 Aug. 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6984222/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2014","accessionNumber":"14827954","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"15 December 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"From Big Data to Big Projects: A Step-by-Step Roadmap","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"From Big Data to Big Projects: A Step-by-Step Roadmap","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"4357a373.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.144237S","chronDate":"27-29 Aug. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6982600","isNumber":"6984143","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6982600","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"6984143","articleId":"6984222","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-02"},{"_id":6984239,"authors":[{"name":"Mohammad Aazam","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, Kyung Hee University, Suwon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Mohammad","lastName":"Aazam","id":"37589584100"},{"name":"Eui-Nam Huh","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, Kyung Hee University, Suwon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Eui-Nam","lastName":"Huh","id":"37326597300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-4357-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6984239","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":288,"citationCountPatent":9,"totalDownloads":7765},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Logic gates","Cloud computing","Wireless sensor networks","Computer architecture","Performance evaluation","Internet of Things"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","Internet of Things","internetworking","network servers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fog computing","smart gateway based communication","Cloud of Things","ubiquitous","context-aware computing","Internet of Things","resource management","service creation","service management","service discovery","data storage","power management","CoT","IoT cloud computing integration","data trimming","smart network","jitter","bulk data upload delay","bulk data synchronization delay"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["IoT","cloud computing","CoT","smart gateway","fog computing"]}],"abstract":"With the increasing applications in the domains of ubiquitous and context-aware computing, Internet of Things (IoT) are gaining importance. In IoTs, literally anything can be part of it, whether it is sensor nodes or dumb objects, so very diverse types of services can be produced. In this regard, resource management, service creation, service management, service discovery, data storage, and power management would require much better infrastructure and sophisticated mechanism. The amount of data IoTs are going to generate would not be possible for standalone power-constrained IoTs to handle. Cloud computing comes into play here. Integration of IoTs with cloud computing, termed as Cloud of Things (CoT) can help achieve the goals of envisioned IoT and future Internet. This IoT-Cloud computing integration is not straight-forward. It involves many challenges. One of those challenges is data trimming. Because unnecessary communication not only burdens the core network, but also the data center in the cloud. For this purpose, data can be preprocessed and trimmed before sending to the cloud. This can be done through a Smart Gateway, accompanied with a Smart Network or Fog Computing. In this paper, we have discussed this concept in detail and present the architecture of Smart Gateway with Fog Computing. We have tested this concept on the basis of Upload Delay, Synchronization Delay, Jitter, Bulk-data Upload Delay, and Bulk-data Synchronization Delay.","doi":"10.1109/FiCloud.2014.83","publicationTitle":"2014 International Conference on Future Internet of Things and Cloud","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 International Conference on Future Internet of Things and Cloud","pdfPath":"/iel7/6982600/6984143/06984239.pdf","startPage":"464","endPage":"470","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6984143","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FiCloud.2014.83","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fog Computing and Smart Gateway Based Communication for Cloud of Things","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6984239","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 Aug. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Fog Computing and Smart Gateway Based Communication for Cloud of Things","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6984239/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2014","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"15 December 2014","accessionNumber":"14827919","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6984239/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"27-29 Aug. 2014","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fog Computing and Smart Gateway Based Communication for Cloud of Things","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"4357a464.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054573S","chronDate":"27-29 Aug. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6982600","isNumber":"6984143","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6982600","citationCount":"288","xplore-issue":"6984143","articleId":"6984239","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6984256,"authors":[{"name":"Rehab M.

Next, a delay-dependent exponential stability criterion is derived in terms of Lyapunov's direct method to guarantee that the trajectories of the slave system can approach those of the master system. Subsequently, the stability conditions of this criterion are reformulated into linear matrix inequalities (LMIs).

The existing anomaly detection models depict the detection profiles with a static way, which lack good adaptability and interoperability. Furthermore, the detection rate is low, so they are difficult to implement the real-time detection under the high-speed network environment. In this paper, the excellent mechanisms of self-learning and adaptability in the human immune system are referred and a dynamic anomaly detection algorithm with immune positive selection, named as RAIM, is proposed. In RAIM, the concepts and formal definitions of antigen, antibody, and memory cells in the network security domain are given, the dynamic clonal principle of antibody is integrated, the mechanism of immune vaccination is discussed, and the dynamic evolvement formulations of detection profiles are established (including the detection profiles' dynamic generation and extinction, dynamic learning, dynamic transformation, and dynamic self-organization), which will accomplish that the detection profiles dynamically synchronize with the real network environment. Our theoretical analysis shows that RAIM is a good solution to network anomaly detection, which increases the veracity and timeliness on anomaly detection.","displayPublicationTitle":"2014

(CRSN), sensors can access the channel randomly due to its spectrum sensing ability. However, frequent channel switching during random access will cause packet collision thus increase the energy consumption. In order to reduce the frequency for channel switching, we propose a novel comprehensive optimal cooperative routing algorithm (COCRA) based on virtual MIMO (multiple input multiple output) and virtual sinks. In our schema, channel conditions of virtual sinks combing with residual energy and distance of a source node are all considered to reduce the energy consumption of random channel transition between source nodes and sink. Simulation results show that COCRA with VMIMO offers considerable improvements in energy efficiency.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy Efficient Virtual MIMO for Cognitive Radio Sensor Networks","publicationTitle":"2014 International Conference on Cyber-Enabled Distributed Computing and Knowledge Discovery","doi":"10.1109/CyberC.2014.65","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 International Conference on Cyber-Enabled Distributed Computing and Knowledge Discovery","pdfPath":"/iel7/6975797/6984259/06984329.pdf","startPage":"337","endPage":"342","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CyberC.2014.65","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6984259","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6984329","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6984329/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 Oct. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Energy Efficient Virtual MIMO for Cognitive Radio Sensor Networks","conferenceDate":"13-15 Oct. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6984329/","dateOfInsertion":"15 December 2014","publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","accessionNumber":"14834152","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy Efficient Virtual MIMO for Cognitive Radio Sensor Networks","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"6236a337.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.120302S","chronDate":"13-15 Oct. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6975797","isNumber":"6984259","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6975797","xplore-issue":"6984259","articleId":"6984329","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6984342,"authors":[{"name":"Ram Narayan Yadav","affiliation":["Indian Institute of Technology Patna, India Computer Science and Engineering"],"firstName":"Ram Narayan","lastName":"Yadav","id":"37085405341"},{"name":"Rajiv Misra","affiliation":["Indian Institute of Technology Patna, India Computer Science and Engineering"],"firstName":"Rajiv","lastName":"Misra","id":"37286366300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6236-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-6235-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6984342","dbTime":"18 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":214},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6984342","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sensors","Cognitive radio","Throughput","Ad hoc networks","Packet loss","Protocols"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ad hoc networks","cognitive radio","transport protocols"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["TCP variants","primary licensed users","channel sensing","channel switching","transport layer protocols","cognitive radio ad-hoc networks","CRAHN"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["cognitive radio","TCP"]}],"doi":"10.1109/CyberC.2014.78","publicationTitle":"2014 International Conference on Cyber-Enabled Distributed Computing and Knowledge Discovery","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 International Conference on Cyber-Enabled Distributed Computing and Knowledge Discovery","pdfPath":"/iel7/6975797/6984259/06984342.pdf","startPage":"414","endPage":"419","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CyberC.2014.78","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6984259","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Analysis of Different TCP Variants in Cognitive Radio Networks","abstract":"Cognitive Radio Networks can use scarce spectrum efficiently and envision as emerging technologies that can fulfill the future demands. In Cognitive Radio Networks, users (or secondary users/ unlicensed users) sense channels and use the idle channels and vacate the channel on being use by primary licensed users so that cognitive users do not interfere with the license users. End-to-end performance of cognitive radio networks plays an important role for applications such as audio-video, infotainment etc. Researches have reported that channel sensing and channel switching overheads lead to large variations in latency and bandwidth parameters. In this paper, we have studied the impact of these variations on transport layer protocols (TCP New Reno, TCP Reno, TCP Tahoe, TCP Sack and TCP Vegas) for Cognitive Radio Ad-Hoc Networks (CRAHN) through simulation on ns-2. On comparing the performance of different TCP variants, we found that TCP New Reno performs better among other TCP variants but remains to adopt environment changes quickly.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 Oct. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6984342/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"14834153","publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","conferenceDate":"13-15 Oct. 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6984342/","dateOfInsertion":"15 December 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"An Analysis of Different TCP Variants in Cognitive Radio Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Analysis of Different TCP Variants in Cognitive Radio Networks","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"6236a414.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047159S","chronDate":"13-15 Oct. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6975797","isNumber":"6984259","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6975797","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6984259","articleId":"6984342","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6984345,"authors":[{"name":"Ahmed Mohammed Mikaeil","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Information Engineering, Changchun University of Science and Technology, Changchun, Jilin Province, China"],"firstName":"Ahmed Mohammed","lastName":"Mikaeil","id":"37085450373"},{"name":"Bin Guo","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Information Engineering, Changchun University of Science and Technology, Changchun, Jilin Province, China"],"firstName":"Bin","lastName":"Guo","id":"37085439262"},{"name":"Zhijun Wang","affiliation":["Jilin Engineering Research Center of RFID, Changchun Normal University, Changchun, Jilin Province, China"],"firstName":"Zhijun","lastName":"Wang","id":"37085443873"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6236-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-6235-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6984345","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":17,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":793},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Sensors","Support vector machines","Decision trees","Accuracy","Data integration","Noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Bayes methods","cognitive radio","decision trees","learning (artificial intelligence)","pattern classification","radio spectrum management","sensor fusion","signal detection","statistics","support vector machines","telecommunication computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DT classifier","decision tree","NB classifier","Naive Bayes","SVM","support vector machine","KNN classifier","K-nearest neighbor","supervised machine learning classifiers","primary user transmission","frame energy test statistics","decision based cooperative spectrum sensing","machine learning based fusion center algorithm","cognitive radio","data fusion approach"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["cooperative spectrum sensing","data fusion","machine learning classifier","per frame decision sensing"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6984345","doi":"10.1109/CyberC.2014.80","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CyberC.2014.80","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6984259","publicationTitle":"2014 International Conference on Cyber-Enabled Distributed Computing and Knowledge Discovery","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 International Conference on Cyber-Enabled Distributed Computing and Knowledge Discovery","pdfPath":"/iel7/6975797/6984259/06984345.pdf","startPage":"429","endPage":"434","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Machine Learning to Data Fusion Approach for Cooperative Spectrum Sensing","abstract":"Cooperative spectrum sensing has been shown to be an effective method to improve the detection performance of the licensed user availability by exploiting spatial diversity. However, cooperation among cognitive radio (CR) users may also introduce a variety of overheads due to the extra sensing time, delay, energy, and operations that limit achievable cooperative gain. In responding to this paper, we propose a machine learning based fusion center algorithm that can provide real time per frame training and decision based cooperative spectrum sensing. The new fusion algorithm based on training a machine learning classifier over a set containing some frame energy test statistics along with their corresponding decisions about the presence or absence of the primary user (PU) transmission, so as to predict the decisions for new frames with new energy test statistics. The simulation and numerical results show that the new approach performs the same as the current fusion rule with less sensing time, delay and operations. In this paper we also present a simulation comparison of four supervised machine learning classifiers: K-nearest neighbor (KNN), support vector machine (SVM), Naive Bayes (NB), and Decision Tree (DT) in classifying 1000 testing frames after training these classifiers over a set containing 1000 frames. It shows that KNN and DT classifier outperform the other two classifiers in the accuracy of classifying the new frames.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6984345/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 Oct. 2014","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"13-15 Oct. 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6984345/","dateOfInsertion":"15 December 2014","publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","accessionNumber":"14834171","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Machine Learning to Data Fusion Approach for Cooperative Spectrum Sensing","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Machine Learning to Data Fusion Approach for Cooperative Spectrum Sensing","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"6236a429.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052324S","chronDate":"13-15 Oct. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6975797","isNumber":"6984259","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6975797","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"6984259","articleId":"6984345","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-10"},{"_id":6984347,"authors":[{"name":"Jie Li","affiliation":["School of Computer and Information"],"firstName":"Jie","lastName":"Li","id":"37085417696"},{"name":"Yuxi Liu","affiliation":["School of Computer and Information"],"firstName":"Yuxi","lastName":"Liu","id":"37085415732"},{"name":"Qiyue Li","affiliation":["School of Electric Engineering and Automation, Hefei University of Technology, Hefei, China"],"firstName":"Qiyue","lastName":"Li","id":"37983878400"},{"name":"Lusheng Wang","affiliation":["School of Computer and Information"],"firstName":"Lusheng","lastName":"Wang","id":"37085419583"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6236-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-6235-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6984347","dbTime":"23 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":108},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resource management","Sociology","Statistics","Interference","Convergence","Optimization","Logic gates"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["chaotic communication","cognitive radio","convergence","radio spectrum management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convergence speed","quantum immune clone algorithm","chaotic search","spectrum efficiency","quantum immune clonal","cognitive radio","spectrum allocation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["cognitive radio","spectrum allocation","quantum immune clonal genetic algorithm","graph coloring"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6984347","doi":"10.1109/CyberC.2014.82","publicationTitle":"2014 International Conference on Cyber-Enabled Distributed Computing and Knowledge Discovery","abstract":"Cognitive radio is a promising technology to improve the spectrum efficiency by allowing unlicensed users to exploit the spectrum unused by licensed users in an opportunistic manner. Spectrum allocation avoids interference between cognitive users and licensed users, thus the spectrum is more efficiently used. Due to the fact that traditional methods in solving the problem of spectrum allocation are easy to be trapped in local optimum with low convergence speed, quantum immune clone algorithm is introduced in this paper. The strategy of population catastrophes based on chaotic search is also executed to avoid falling into local optimum. In this paper, we propose a quantum immune clonal based spectrum allocation approach.

In this paper, a Minimum spanning tree based Feature Clustering (MFC) algorithm is proposed. In the algorithm, an information-theoretic based measure, i.e., Variation of information, is utilized as the feature redundancy and relevance metric. At the clustering phase, the sum of pair wise feature redundancy is minimized. Then, a representative feature is selected from each cluster, where the relevance between representative features and the target label is maximized. The algorithm is supervised since it is designed for various supervised learning problems, such as classification and regression. The proposed MFC is compared with three conventional feature selection algorithms, two of which are also feature clustering method. The MFC obtains well separated feature clusters in the experiment and considerable better classification accuracies applied on several real data sets.","doi":"10.1109/ICTAI.2014.47","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 26th International Conference on Tools with Artificial Intelligence","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 26th International Conference on Tools with Artificial Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel7/6979774/6983902/06984483.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICTAI.2014.47","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6983902","startPage":"264","endPage":"271","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Supervised Feature Selection Algorithm through Minimum Spanning Tree Clustering","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6984483","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Supervised Feature Selection Algorithm through Minimum Spanning Tree Clustering","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 Nov. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6984483/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"10-12 Nov. 2014","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2014","accessionNumber":"14827676","dateOfInsertion":"15 December 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6984483/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Supervised Feature Selection Algorithm through Minimum Spanning Tree Clustering","confLoc":"Limassol, Cyprus","sourcePdf":"6572a264.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067415S","chronDate":"10-12 Nov. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6979774","isNumber":"6983902","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6979774","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6983902","articleId":"6984483","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6984535,"authors":[{"name":"Virginia O.

This task is more challenging when required to be performed without physical contact and at a distance. Analyzing video footages from individuals for patterns is an active area of research aiming at fulfilling this goal. We describe results on classifiers trained to identify individuals from data collected from 140 subjects walking in front of a Microsoft Kinect sensor, which allows tracking 3D points representing a subject's skeleton. From this data we extract anthropometric and gait attributes to be used by the classifiers. We show that anthropometric features are more important than gait features but using both allows for higher accuracies. Additionally, we explore how different numbers of subjects and numbers of available examples affect accuracy, providing evidences on how effective the proposed methodology can be in different scenarios.","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 26th International Conference on Tools with Artificial Intelligence","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 26th International Conference on Tools with Artificial Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel7/6979774/6983902/06984535.pdf","startPage":"627","endPage":"633","doi":"10.1109/ICTAI.2014.99","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICTAI.2014.99","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6983902","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Full Body Person Identification Using the Kinect Sensor","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6984535/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 Nov. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Full Body Person Identification Using the Kinect Sensor","htmlLink":"/document/6984535/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"15 December 2014","accessionNumber":"14827674","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"10-12 Nov. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Full Body Person Identification Using the Kinect Sensor","confLoc":"Limassol, Cyprus","sourcePdf":"6572a627.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057475S","chronDate":"10-12 Nov. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6979774","isNumber":"6983902","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6979774","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"6983902","articleId":"6984535","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6984537,"authors":[{"name":"Vinicius Godoy","affiliation":["Post-graduate Program in Informatics (PPGIa), Pontifical Catholic University of Parana (PUCPR), Curitiba, PR, Brazil"],"firstName":"Vinicius","lastName":"Godoy","id":"37085355754"},{"name":"Alceu S.

Due to the lack of measured gravity data, the previous methods generally used digital elevation model (DEM) to model gravity anomaly reference maps, however, which neglected the impact of terrain density in homogeneity. In this paper, a novel and practical method is proposed for modeling a reference map which takes a full consideration of the terrain density difference.

In order to enhance MCTS ability to tackle such problems, one can benefit from game specific knowledge in order to increase the accuracy of the game state evaluation. Such a knowledge is not easy to acquire. It is the result of a constructivist learning mechanism based on the experience of the player. That is why we explore the idea to endow the MCTS with a process inspired by constructivist learning, to self-acquire knowledge from playing experience. In this paper, we propose a complementary process for MCTS called BHRF (Background History Reply Forest), which allows to memorize efficient patterns in order to promote their use through the MCTS process. Our experimental results lead to promising results and underline how self-acquired data can be useful for MCTS based algorithms.","pdfPath":"/iel7/6979774/6983902/06984587.pdf","startPage":"997","endPage":"1003","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 26th International Conference on Tools with Artificial Intelligence","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6983902","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICTAI.2014.151","doi":"10.1109/ICTAI.2014.151","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 26th International Conference on Tools with Artificial Intelligence","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6984587","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Games","Context","Vegetation","Monte Carlo methods","History","Computational modeling","Data structures"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer games","game theory","learning (artificial intelligence)","Monte Carlo methods","tree searching"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["knowledge complement","Monte Carlo tree search","combinatorial games","MCTS","combinatorial problems","Computer Go problem","artificial intelligence","game state evaluation","constructivist learning mechanism","BHRF","background history reply forest"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Monte Carlo Tree Search","Computer-Game","Reinforcement Learning","Knowledge Engineering"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 Nov. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6984587/","displayDocTitle":"Knowledge Complement for Monte Carlo Tree Search: An Application to Combinatorial Games","accessionNumber":"14827725","dateOfInsertion":"15 December 2014","publicationDate":"Nov. 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6984587/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"10-12 Nov. 2014","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Knowledge Complement for Monte Carlo Tree Search: An Application to Combinatorial Games","confLoc":"Limassol, Cyprus","sourcePdf":"6572a997.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059329S","chronDate":"10-12 Nov. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6979774","isNumber":"6983902","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6979774","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6983902","articleId":"6984587","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6984626,"authors":[{"name":"Jianping Zheng","affiliation":["State Key Lab of ISN, Xidian University, Xi'an, P.

Unfortunately, few additional diversity gain is gathered by the modified VP precoding in single-antenna OFDM system. On the other hand, as far as we know, there is still no research on the VP precoding for MIMO-OFDM systems.

In this study, we focus on multi-user multiple-input multiple-output orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (MU-MIMO-OFDM) networks, which are considered as the standard configurations of future wireless networks. Specifically, we study and analyze the performance gain brought by time-domain schedulers in terms of power efficiency gain (PEG) in MU-MIMO-OFDM wireless networks with rate constraints. To enable the evaluation of PEG in such a complex channel model, a fast approximation method is proposed to efficiently obtain an approximated PEG which is shown to be an accurate surrogate. With the proposed method, the approximated PEG is numerically simulated in the 3rd generation partnership project spatial channel extended model (SCME). Simulation results show that the approximated PEG is generally insignificant under most practical outdoor wireless environments defined in the SCME, e.g., Less than 1.5dB for a 1-second scheduling period. The approximated PEG further reduces as the numbers of users and equipped antennas increase. This study indicates that it should be reconsidered when employing traditional time-domain scheduling techniques in the rate-constrained MU-MIMO-OFDM networks.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Numerical Study of Scheduling Power Efficiency Gain for MIMO-OFDM Networks","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Conference on Computer and Information Technology","doi":"10.1109/CIT.2014.149","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Conference on Computer and Information Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/6973087/6984594/06984629.pdf","startPage":"54","endPage":"58","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CIT.2014.149","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6984594","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6984629","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6984629/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 Sept. 2014","displayDocTitle":"A Numerical Study of Scheduling Power Efficiency Gain for MIMO-OFDM Networks","conferenceDate":"11-13 Sept. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6984629/","dateOfInsertion":"15 December 2014","publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","accessionNumber":"14834133","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Numerical Study of Scheduling Power Efficiency Gain for MIMO-OFDM Networks","confLoc":"Xi'an, China","sourcePdf":"6239a054.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048303S","chronDate":"11-13 Sept. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6973087","isNumber":"6984594","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6973087","xplore-issue":"6984594","articleId":"6984629","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6984637,"authors":[{"name":"Wu Shandan","affiliation":["Xidian University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Wu","lastName":"Shandan","id":"37085392180"},{"name":"An Peng","affiliation":["Xidian University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"An","lastName":"Peng","id":"37085382000"},{"name":"Li Chao","affiliation":["Xidian University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Li","lastName":"Chao","id":"37085389237"},{"name":"Yao Mingwu","affiliation":["Xidian University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Yao","lastName":"Mingwu","id":"37564606600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6239-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6984637","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":557},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Interference","Transmitting antennas","Wireless communication","Receiving antennas","Fading"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","fading channels","MIMO communication","radiofrequency interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["full duplex MIMO wireless communication system","bidirectional communication","self-interfering signal","self-interference cancellation","antenna cancellation","analog domain cancellation","digital domain cancellation","different node distance","fading channel models","channel estimation error","residual interference"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["full-duplex","interference cancellation","MIMO"]}],"abstract":"We propose a full-duplex MIMO wireless communication system where simultaneous bidirectional communication in the same band is obtained via cancellation of the self-interfering signal.

provide multilevel parallelism, and parallelizing flash operations is the key to improving performance. Most of existing research works dispatch and schedule host requests so that the obtained sub-requests can be served in parallel, however, these works seldom parallelize the extra operations introduced by the internal garbage collection (GC) process. The costly operation sequence of GC is the main reason for I/O blocking, especially when the device is close to be full. In this paper, we propose a novel Subdivided Garbage Collector (SGC), which exploits both the system-level and the flash-level parallelism to parallelize garbage-collecting operations as well as garbage-collecting activities. SGC confines the GC process inside a flash chip, utilizing the system-level parallelism to overlapping garbage-collecting activities with I/O services among different chips. The flash-level parallelism is further exploited with a novel queue mechanism, which schedules and packs the reordered partial steps of cleaning sequence into parallel operations. To make more parallelization possible, a dynamic conflict-aware address allocator is proposed to eliminate the host writes and cleaning operations from contending for the critical components of the device. Trace-driven simulations demonstrate that the proposals can hide overheads of GC, resulting in a shorter response time.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6984656/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 Sept. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","accessionNumber":"14827156","htmlLink":"/document/6984656/","dateOfInsertion":"15 December 2014","conferenceDate":"11-13 Sept. 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Assimilating Cleaning Operations with Flash-Level Parallelism for NAND Flash-Based Devices","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Assimilating Cleaning Operations with Flash-Level Parallelism for NAND Flash-Based Devices","confLoc":"Xi'an, China","sourcePdf":"6239a212.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064179S","chronDate":"11-13 Sept. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6973087","isNumber":"6984594","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6973087","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6984594","articleId":"6984656","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":6984678,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaolin Deng","affiliation":["Beijing Inst. of Technol., Commun.

In this paper, a QoE-driven radio resource allocation scheme has been developed for the multiuser-multiservice OFDM system. Different from the previous schemes, we take the service type into consideration when allocating radio resource. Three multimedia applications have been discussed in this work, including Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP), Internet Protocol Television (IPTV) and File Download (FD). For all the multimedia applications, their QoE are related to the scheduled radio resource, the objective of our scheduling scheme is to maximize the overall QoE while guaranteeing all the users can perceive a relatively good QoE level. The proposed scheduling algorithm can be divided into two parts: Firstly, allocate subcarriers to all the users in order to guarantee their minimal transmit rate requirement, then the remaining subcarriers are allocated to the users who can achieve the best QoE gain. The simulation results indicate that our algorithm can reach high overall QoE performance while maintaining an acceptable fairness in the system.","doi":"10.1109/CIT.2014.47","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Conference on Computer and Information Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Conference on Computer and Information Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/6973087/6984594/06984678.pdf","startPage":"351","endPage":"355","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CIT.2014.47","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6984594","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A QoE-Driven Resource Allocation Strategy for OFDM Multiuser-Multiservice System","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6984678","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 Sept. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6984678/","displayDocTitle":"A QoE-Driven Resource Allocation Strategy for OFDM Multiuser-Multiservice System","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","accessionNumber":"14834120","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6984678/","conferenceDate":"11-13 Sept. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"15 December 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A QoE-Driven Resource Allocation Strategy for OFDM Multiuser-Multiservice System","confLoc":"Xi'an, China","sourcePdf":"6239a351.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068903S","chronDate":"11-13 Sept. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6973087","isNumber":"6984594","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6973087","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6984594","articleId":"6984678","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":6984679,"authors":[{"name":"Yuan Hua Liu","affiliation":["School of Telecommunication and Information Engineering, Xi'an University of Posts and Telecommunications, Xian, China"],"firstName":"Yuan Hua","lastName":"Liu","id":"37085468877"},{"name":"Mei Ling Zhang","affiliation":["School of Telecommunication and Information Engineering, Xi'an University of Posts and Telecommunications, Xian, China"],"firstName":"Mei Ling","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37085459778"},{"name":"Xin Liang Niu","affiliation":["Xian Branch of China Academy of Space Technology, Xian, China"],"firstName":"Xin Liang","lastName":"Niu","id":"37085460610"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6239-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6984679","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":66},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6984679","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bit error rate","Iterative decoding","Decoding","Design methodology","Simulation","Encoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["block codes","cyclic codes","matrix algebra","parity check codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["quasi-cyclic LDPC codes","combining method improvement","Chinese remainder theorem","QC-LDPC codes","block columns","parity check matrices","component codes","short cycles","performance design"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Low-density parity-check codes","quasi-cyclic","circulant permutation"]}],"abstract":"An improved combining method based on the Chinese Remainder Theorem is proposed for constructing much better quasi-cyclic (QC) LDPC codes.

The filter operator is a central part of query evaluation. Its main objective is to reduce the amount of data as early as possible in order to reduce the calculation costs for succeeding and more complex operators such as join operators. Due to the proximity to the data source it is essential for the overall query performance that the filter operator is able to evaluate single data items as fast as possible. In this work, the advantages of using FPGAs in query evaluation are outlined and an overview about the provided degree of parallelism is given. We propose two different approaches to implement the filter operator for the Semantic Web database LUPOSDATE. The Fully-Parallel Filter evaluates all conditions by dividing the input into several sub-items which are evaluated by dedicated sub-filters in parallel. The second approach creates a pipeline of sub-filters to evaluate the filter expression step-by-step. If an item reaches the end of this pipeline then it complies the whole filter expression. The final evaluation shows that both approaches of the hardware-implemented filter operator defeat the comparable software solution written in C running at 2.66 GHz. Processing 100M items per second, the hardware-accelerated filter running at 200 MHz provides a more than 5 times higher throughput than the general-purpose CPU. In contrast to the software solution, the total throughput is independent of the match rate and the structure of the filter expression, and is a valuable contribution to the hardware-accelerated query evaluation.","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Conference on Computer and Information

of multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system in a single cell via determining the tilting angles of two beams adaptively in a coordinated fashion. In this framework, two antenna beams adjust their tilting angles jointly based on the location of users to maximize the sum throughput of the scheduled users, denoted as coordinated user-specific double-beam tilting (CUSDBT) and coordinated vertical region-specific double-beam tilting (CVRSDBT). Assuming the availability of location information of scheduled users, accurate analytical expression for cell average achievable rate is provided. To determine the optimal tilting angles for BS beams to maximize sum throughput, Dividing Rectangle (DIRECT) method, an effective approach for optimization problems, is applied. Simulation results show that the proposed coordinated double-beam tilting scheme outperforms the conventional antenna tilting schemes.","doi":"10.1109/CIT.2014.48","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Conference on Computer and Information Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Conference on Computer and Information Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/6973087/6984594/06984731.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CIT.2014.48","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6984594","startPage":"674","endPage":"678","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Throughput Optimization in MU-MIMO Systems via Coordinated Vertical Double-Beam Tilting","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6984731","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Throughput Optimization in MU-MIMO Systems via Coordinated Vertical Double-Beam Tilting","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 Sept. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6984731/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"11-13 Sept. 2014","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","accessionNumber":"14834151","dateOfInsertion":"15 December 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6984731/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Throughput Optimization in MU-MIMO Systems via Coordinated Vertical Double-Beam Tilting","confLoc":"Xi'an, China","sourcePdf":"6239a674.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065938S","chronDate":"11-13 Sept. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6973087","isNumber":"6984594","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6973087","xplore-issue":"6984594","articleId":"6984731","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6984734,"authors":[{"name":"Hui Ma","affiliation":["Engineering Center of Digital Audio and Video, Communication University of China, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Hui","lastName":"Ma","id":"37085447078"},{"name":"Hang Yin","affiliation":["Engineering Center of Digital Audio and Video, Communication University of China, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Hang","lastName":"Yin","id":"37673281000"},{"name":"Hongfei Guo","affiliation":["Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Hongfei","lastName":"Guo","id":"37085438728"},{"name":"Jianhua Zhao","affiliation":["Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jianhua","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37085443127"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6239-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6984734","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":66},"abstract":"In this paper, a novel single-carrier digital broadcasting system applying LDPC codes in shortwave on the basis of the DRM system is designed. The system uses short LDPC codes to replace the multilevel coding in DRM, and is based on the single-carrier block transmission technology. Compared with the standard DRM systems, it has a simple process, a low requirement for the power amplifier and power consumption in the transmitter. So that it is easy to meet the needs of portable transmitter and receiver. The simulation shows that the novel system can provide better performance compared to the existing DRM systems in the DRM channel model. It is an effective scheme which can realize long-distance and wide-range covering in the power-limited circumstances.","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Conference on Computer and Information Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/6973087/6984594/06984734.pdf","startPage":"689","endPage":"693","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Conference on Computer and Information Technology","doi":"10.1109/CIT.2014.66","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CIT.2014.66","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6984594","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6984734","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Novel Single-Carrier Digital Broadcasting System Based on LDPC Codes in Shortwave","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Parity check codes","Broadcasting","OFDM","Channel coding","Modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["broadcasting","digital radio","parity check codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["single-carrier digital broadcasting system","LDPC","shortwave communication","multilevel coding","single-carrier block transmission technology","power amplifier","power consumption","portable transmitter","portable receiver","DRM channel model","power-limitation","low-density parity-check code","digital radio modiale"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["single-carrier","digital broadcasting","LDPC codes","shortwave"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6984734/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 Sept. 2014","displayDocTitle":"A Novel Single-Carrier Digital Broadcasting System Based on LDPC Codes in Shortwave","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6984734/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","accessionNumber":"14834092","dateOfInsertion":"15 December 2014","conferenceDate":"11-13 Sept. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel Single-Carrier Digital Broadcasting System Based on LDPC Codes in Shortwave","confLoc":"Xi'an, China","sourcePdf":"6239a689.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046397S","chronDate":"11-13 Sept. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6973087","isNumber":"6984594","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6973087","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6984594","articleId":"6984734","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":6984741,"authors":[{"name":"K.P.

We adopt the mean squared error (MSE) as the performance criterion. Assuming training based channel estimation, we investigate the effect of imperfect channel state information (CSI) upon estimation performance. Under the constraint that the sum of data and training transmit power at each sensor is fixed, we study how the estimation performance is related to the power allocation between training and data. Extensive simulations are carried out to test the impact of imperfect CSI. Our results show that the channel estimation error decreases the estimation performance in terms of both the linear minimum mean square error (LMMSE) and the optimal weighted least squares (OWLS) fusion rule, and the former outperforms the latter. Besides, the performance gap between the optimal and the imperfect CSI varies from the data power ratio and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR).","pdfPath":"/iel7/6973087/6984594/06984770.pdf","startPage":"876","endPage":"879","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Conference on Computer and Information Technology","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6984594","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CIT.2014.157","doi":"10.1109/CIT.2014.157","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Conference on Computer and Information Technology","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6984770","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","Estimation","Signal to noise ratio","Training","Resource management","Sensor fusion"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","least mean squares methods","sensor fusion","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed estimation","random parameter","wireless sensor network","orthogonal noisy channels","fusion center","mean squared error","training based channel estimation","imperfect channel state information","CSI","power allocation","channel estimation error","linear minimum mean square error","LMMSE","optimal weighted least squares fusion rule","OWLS fusion rule","data power ratio","signal-to-noise ratio","SNR"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["channel estimation","CSI","distributed estimation","optimal power allocation","LMMSE","OWLS"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 Sept. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6984770/","displayDocTitle":"Impact of Channel Estimation Error Upon Distributed Estimation Systems","accessionNumber":"14834145","dateOfInsertion":"15 December 2014","publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6984770/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"11-13 Sept. 2014","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Impact of Channel Estimation Error Upon Distributed Estimation Systems","confLoc":"Xi'an, China","sourcePdf":"6239a876.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065454S","chronDate":"11-13 Sept. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6973087","isNumber":"6984594","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6973087","xplore-issue":"6984594","articleId":"6984770","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":6984771,"authors":[{"name":"Xi Shen","affiliation":["State Radio Monitoring Center, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xi","lastName":"Shen","id":"37085517966"},{"name":"Shuhui Jiang","affiliation":["State Radio Monitoring Center, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Shuhui","lastName":"Jiang","id":"37085507906"},{"name":"Xi Wu","affiliation":["State Radio Monitoring Center, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xi","lastName":"Wu","id":"38009968200"},{"name":"Dayong Liu","affiliation":["State Radio Monitoring Center, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Dayong","lastName":"Liu","id":"37085503122"},{"name":"Xiaofei Zhang","affiliation":["State Radio Monitoring Center, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xiaofei","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37085511990"},{"name":"Jie Zhu","affiliation":["China Electronics Standardization Institute, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jie","lastName":"Zhu","id":"37085593285"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6239-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6984771","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":163},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wireless sensor networks","Power demand","Monitoring","Digital signal processing","Routing","Green products","Antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antennas","monitoring","radio-over-fibre","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["green hierarchical radio-over-fiber distributed antenna system","wireless sensor network","spectrum monitoring","hierarchical monitoring network architecture","power consumption model"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["spectrum monitoring","radio-over-fiber","distributed antenna system","wireless sensor network"]}],"abstract":"This paper innovatively proposes a solution for spectrum monitoring by building a green radio-over-fiber (RoF) distributed antenna system (DAS) based wireless sensor network (WSN) according to the actual monitoring demands.

This paper examines some of those strategies, analyzing their properties, and comparing empirically their outputs based on two quality indicators, additive epsilon and hyper volume. Most of the archiving techniques studied in this work cannot ensure that at the end of the process their vectors are all optimal. Due to this fact, a new approach is presented, based on a second archive to store the points which would be discarded. The main idea is verify how much the recycled vectors could improve the generated set.

In order to smooth out this problem, we will apply meta-learning and multi-objective optimization in the choice of important parameters of ensemble systems. Therefore, this work applies meta-learning techniques to define an initial configuration of an multi-objective optimization algorithm, more specifically NSGA II. The meta-learner is used to recommend the proportion of each type of base classifiers to compose the ensemble systems. The NSGA II is used to generate heterogeneous ensembles selecting attributes, types and parameters of base classifiers optimizing the classification error and the bad diversity. The results are analysed using error rate and multi-objective metrics in order to verify whether to use of meta-learning generates more accurate ensemble systems.","doi":"10.1109/BRACIS.2014.27","startPage":"91","endPage":"96","publicationTitle":"2014 Brazilian Conference on Intelligent Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BRACIS.2014.27","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6984785","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 Brazilian Conference on Intelligent Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/6979382/6984785/06984813.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Meta-learning and Multi-objective Optimization to Design Ensemble of Classifiers","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6984813/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Meta-learning and Multi-objective Optimization to Design Ensemble of Classifiers","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6984813/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"14834277","publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"15 December 2014","conferenceDate":"18-22 Oct. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-22 Oct. 2014","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Meta-learning and Multi-objective Optimization to Design Ensemble of Classifiers","confLoc":"Sao Paulo, Brazil","sourcePdf":"5618a091.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064639S","chronDate":"18-22 Oct. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6979382","isNumber":"6984785","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6979382","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6984785","articleId":"6984813","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6984814,"authors":[{"name":"Marcos Eduardo Valle","affiliation":["Department of Applied Mathematics, Scientific Computing University of Campinas, Brazil"],"firstName":"Marcos Eduardo","lastName":"Valle","id":"37606185100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-5618-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6984814","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":17,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":122},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Quaternions","Neurons","Vectors","Biological neural networks","Noise","Error analysis","Computational modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Hopfield neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["vector recall","unit quaternions","mild-conditions","CV-QHNN synthesis","projection rule","optimal absolute storage capacity","noise tolerance","associative memory model","vector storage","continuous-valued quaternionic Hopfield neural network"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Quaternion","Hopfield neural network","associative memory"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6984814","abstract":"In this paper, we introduce a kind of Hopfield network that can be used for the storage and recall of vectors whose entries are unit quaternion's.

This paper addresses neural network (NN) learning in non-stationary environments related to financial markets, aiming at forecasting stock closing price. To face up this dynamic scenario, an efficient NN model is required. Therefore, Constructive Neural Networks (CoNN) were employed due to its self-adaptation capability, in contrast to regular NN which demands parameter adjustment. This paper investigates a possible ensemble organization, composed by NN's trained with the Cascade Correlation CoNN algorithm. An ensemble is an effective approach to non-stationary learning because it provides pre-defined rules that enable new learners - with new knowledge - to take part of the ensemble along data stream processing. Results obtained with data stream related with four different stocks are then analysed and favorably compared with those obtained with the traditional MLP NNs, trained with Backpropagation.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-22 Oct. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6984816/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"14834281","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6984816/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"15 December 2014","conferenceDate":"18-22 Oct. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Stock Closing Price Forecasting Using Ensembles of Constructive Neural Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Stock Closing Price Forecasting Using Ensembles of Constructive Neural Networks","confLoc":"Sao Paulo, Brazil","sourcePdf":"5618a109.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062918S","chronDate":"18-22 Oct. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6979382","isNumber":"6984785","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6979382","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6984785","articleId":"6984816","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-10"},{"_id":6984832,"authors":[{"name":"Luiz F.

In tweet sentiment analysis, opinions in messages can be typically categorized as positive or negative. To classify them, researchers have been using traditional classifiers like Naive Bayes, Maximum Entropy, and Support Vector Machines (SVM). In this paper, we show that a SVM classifier combined with a cluster ensemble can offer better classification accuracies than a stand-alone SVM. In our study, we employed an algorithm, named C3E-SL, capable to combine classifier and cluster ensembles. This algorithm can refine tweet classifications from additional information provided by clusterers, assuming that similar instances from the same clusters are more likely to share the same class label. The resulting classifier has shown to be competitive with the best results found so far in the literature, thereby suggesting that the studied approach is promising for tweet sentiment classification.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6984832/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-22 Oct. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"15 December 2014","publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","accessionNumber":"14834227","htmlLink":"/document/6984832/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"18-22 Oct. 2014","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Combining Classification and Clustering for Tweet Sentiment Analysis","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Combining Classification and Clustering for Tweet Sentiment Analysis","confLoc":"Sao Paulo, Brazil","sourcePdf":"5618a210.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.115514S","chronDate":"18-22 Oct. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6979382","isNumber":"6984785","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6979382","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"6984785","articleId":"6984832","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6984849,"authors":[{"name":"Carolina Paula de Almeida","affiliation":["Computer Science Department-UNICENTRO, Guarapuava, PR, Brazil"],"firstName":"Carolina Paula de","lastName":"Almeida","id":"37681171500"},{"name":"Richard Aderbal Gon\u00e7alves","affiliation":["Computer Science Department-UNICENTRO, Guarapuava, PR, Brazil"],"firstName":"Richard Aderbal","lastName":"Gon\u00e7alves","id":"37668535300"},{"name":"Elizabeth Ferreira Goldbarg","affiliation":["Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte, Natal, RN, Brazil"],"firstName":"Elizabeth Ferreira","lastName":"Goldbarg","id":"37565904200"},{"name":"Marco Cesar Goldbarg","affiliation":["Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte, Natal, RN, Brazil"],"firstName":"Marco Cesar","lastName":"Goldbarg","id":"37565903900"},{"name":"Myriam Regattieri Delgado","affiliation":["Graduate Program in Electrical and Computer Engineering Federal University of Parana, Curitiba, PR, Brazil"],"firstName":"Myriam Regattieri","lastName":"Delgado","id":"37344897400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-5618-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6984849","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":126},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6984849","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Biological cells","Vectors","Sociology","Statistics","Sorting","Optimization","Algorithm design and analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","Pareto optimisation","statistical testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["transgenetic algorithm","multiobjective quadratic assignment problem","mQAP","hard optimization problem","hybrid algorithm","evolutionary multiobjective optimization framework","EMO algorithm","Pareto dominance","NSTA","TA-NSGA-II","MOTA-D","TA-MOEA-D","nonparametric statistical test","multiobjective quality indicators"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Transgenetic Algorithms","Multi-Objective Optimization","Quadratic Assignment Problem"]}],"doi":"10.1109/BRACIS.2014.63","pdfPath":"/iel7/6979382/6984785/06984849.pdf","publicationTitle":"2014 Brazilian Conference on Intelligent Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 Brazilian Conference on Intelligent Systems","startPage":"312","endPage":"317","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6984785","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BRACIS.2014.63","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Transgenetic Algorithms for the Multi-objective Quadratic Assignment Problem","abstract":"The multi-objective Quadratic Assignment Problem (mQAP) is a hard optimization problem with many real-world applications, such as in hospital layouts.

Transgenetic Algorithms (TAs) are evolutionary algorithms based on cooperation as the main evolutionary strategy. Two hybrid algorithms are proposed to deal with the mQAP: NSTA (TA + NSGA-II) and MOTA/D (TA + MOEA/D). To analyze the performance of the proposed algorithms, non-parametric statistical tests and multi-objective quality indicators are used.

This becomes an issue when dealing with costly problems. Surrogate models may overcome this difficulty, though their use in problems with medium to large dimensionality is underexplored in the literature. Problems with multiple conflicting objectives can be formulated as Multi-objective Optimization Problems (MOPs). MOPs have received a great attention lately, mainly with Multi-objective Evolutionary Algorithms (MOEAs). This paper proposes ELMOEA/D-DE, a surrogate-assisted MOEA, for solving expensive MOPs in small evaluation budgets. ELMOEA/D-DE encompasses a state-of-the-art MOEA based on decomposition, Differential Evolution (DE) operators and Extreme Learning Machines. This paper tests three variants of ELMOEA/D-DE, using different DE operators, for solving five known benchmark MOPs with 10 to 60 decision variables. All variants achieve good results in terms of hyper volume metric and the best variant with operator DE/rand/1/bin is compared with two state-of-the-art approaches (MOEA/D-RBF and a non-surrogate-based MOEA), achieving the best results in all but one problems instances.","doi":"10.1109/BRACIS.2014.64","startPage":"318","endPage":"323","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 Brazilian Conference on Intelligent Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/6979382/6984785/06984850.pdf","publicationTitle":"2014 Brazilian Conference on Intelligent Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BRACIS.2014.64","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6984785","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"ELMOEA/D-DE: Extreme Learning Surrogate Models in Multi-objective Optimization Based on Decomposition and Differential Evolution","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optimization","Sociology","Statistics","Vectors","Training","Computational modeling","Measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["evolutionary computation","learning (artificial intelligence)","optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ELMOEA/D-DE","extreme learning surrogate model","multiobjective optimization problem","decomposition","differential evolution","multiobjective evolutionary algorithm","surrogate-assisted MOEA","extreme learning machine","hyper volume metric"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["multi-objective optimization","surrogate model","extreme learning machine","decomposition","differential evolution"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6984850/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-22 Oct. 2014","displayDocTitle":"ELMOEA/D-DE: Extreme Learning Surrogate Models in Multi-objective Optimization Based on Decomposition and Differential Evolution","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6984850/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"15 December 2014","conferenceDate":"18-22 Oct. 2014","accessionNumber":"14834228","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"ELMOEA/D-DE: Extreme Learning Surrogate Models in Multi-objective Optimization Based on Decomposition and Differential Evolution","confLoc":"Sao Paulo, Brazil","sourcePdf":"5618a318.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.090134S","chronDate":"18-22 Oct. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6979382","isNumber":"6984785","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6979382","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"6984785","articleId":"6984850","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6984866,"authors":[{"name":"Luciano S.

This process can be treated as an optimization problem, aiming to find a subset of TCs which optimizes one or more objective functions (i.e., selection criteria). In this light, we developed two new mechanisms for TC selection which consider two objectives simultaneously: maximize branch coverage while minimizing execution cost (time). These mechanisms were implemented using multi-objective techniques based on Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO).

The resultant sensor is an optical fibre pressure and temperature sensor (OFPTS), able to measure temperature and pressure simultaneously in precisely the same location within the optical fibre. Hence the temperature measurement can be used to accurately compensate any thermal fluctuations in the pressure measurements, leading to an improved long term stability. The Bragg-wavelength can be tailored to coincide with any part of the Fabry-Perot Interferometer (FPI) spectrum (e.g. define the FBG at a valley of the FPI spectrum). We use a modified femtosecond laser, point-by-point inscription method for precise and controlled placement of the fibre Bragg grating. Our technique can be readily adapted to commercial production methods for optical fibre sensors as it greatly mitigates the alignment problems associated with femtosecond laser inscription of gratings in optical fibres. The sensor presented in this paper is entirely fabricated with quartz glass, which makes it fully bio-compatible and can be used for biomedical application. The sensors achieved a high sensitivity of 1.3 nm over kPa resulting in a resolution of ~ 1mmHg and a temperature sensitivity of ~ 10.7pm over K. After the inscription, the sensors still demonstrated a stability of better than 0.1% in 30min.

Additionally, a high simplicity and versatility with a good trade-off between its main performances and power has been sought. Experimental results for signals buried in white noise confirm the capability of the LIA to effectively recover information from signal-to noise power ratios up to -33 dB with errors below 2 % up to 0.7 MHz with 1.7 mW of power consumption, showing up that higher frequency operation with a reduction in voltage supply and power with respect to previously reported LIAs is achieved.","doi":"10.1109/ICSENS.2014.6984937","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSENS.2014.6984937","startPage":"78","endPage":"81","displayPublicationTitle":"SENSORS, 2014 IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel7/6971895/6984913/06984937.pdf","publicationTitle":"SENSORS, 2014 IEEE","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6984913","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A CMOS 1.2-V 1.7-mW lock-in amplifier for sensing applications up to 0.7-MHz","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Nov. 2014","displayDocTitle":"A CMOS 1.2-V 1.7-mW lock-in amplifier for sensing applications up to 0.7-MHz","conferenceDate":"2-5 Nov. 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"15 December 2014","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6984937/","accessionNumber":"14833921","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6984937/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A CMOS 1.2-V 1.7-mW lock-in amplifier for sensing applications up to 0.7-MHz","confLoc":"Valencia, Spain","sourcePdf":"1626.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068586S","chronDate":"2-5 Nov. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6971895","isNumber":"6984913","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6971895","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6984913","articleId":"6984937","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6984949,"authors":[{"name":"Lorena Parra","affiliation":["Instituto de Investigacion para la gestion Integrada de zonas Costeras, Universidad Politecnica de Valencia, Spain"],"firstName":"Lorena","lastName":"Parra","id":"37085354280"},{"name":"Sandra Sendra","affiliation":["Instituto de Investigacion para la gestion Integrada de zonas Costeras, Universidad Politecnica de Valencia, Spain","Instituto de Telecomunica\u00e7\u00f5es, University of Beira Interior Rua Marqu\u00eas de Avila e Bolama, Covilha, Portugal"],"firstName":"Sandra","lastName":"Sendra","id":"37545346200"},{"name":"Jaime Lloret","affiliation":["Instituto de Investigacion para la gestion Integrada de zonas Costeras, Universidad Politecnica de Valencia, Spain"],"firstName":"Jaime","lastName":"Lloret","id":"37392057200"},{"name":"Joel J.P.C.

They provide habitat for birds, reptiles or fish. In last 25 years, this area has been severely depleted by the conversion to agricultural crops, aquaculture and pollution. The increased use of fertilizer and long periods of high salinity levels has considerably reduced the population of mangroves. Thus, this paper proposes the development of a low cost wireless salinity sensor network to control floodgates of fresh water from lakes and reservoirs which reach the mangrove area. The system consists of a set of programmable nodes able to communicate with the control gate system. These nodes send the water characteristics to the systems that open the floodgates of fresh water. The system helps us to control and get lower salinity levels and avoid the water logging. Having low cost sensors will facilitate the deployment of wireless sensor networks.","doi":"10.1109/ICSENS.2014.6984949","displayPublicationTitle":"SENSORS, 2014 IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel7/6971895/6984913/06984949.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6984913","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSENS.2014.6984949","publicationTitle":"SENSORS, 2014 IEEE","startPage":"126","endPage":"129","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low cost wireless sensor network for salinity monitoring in mangrove forests","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6984949","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Nov. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Low cost wireless sensor network for salinity monitoring in mangrove forests","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6984949/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6984949/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2014","accessionNumber":"14826991","dateOfInsertion":"15 December 2014","conferenceDate":"2-5 Nov. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low cost wireless sensor network for salinity monitoring in mangrove forests","confLoc":"Valencia, Spain","sourcePdf":"1426.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075043S","chronDate":"2-5 Nov. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6971895","isNumber":"6984913","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6971895","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"6984913","articleId":"6984949","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6984950,"authors":[{"name":"Manlio Bacco","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering and Mathematic Science, University of Siena, Italy","National Research Council of Italy (CNR), Information Science and Technologies Institute (ISTI), Pisa, Italy"],"firstName":"Manlio","lastName":"Bacco","id":"37085426898"},{"name":"Erina Ferro","affiliation":["National Research Council of Italy (CNR), Information Science and Technologies Institute (ISTI), Pisa, Italy"],"firstName":"Erina","lastName":"Ferro","id":"37284204800"},{"name":"Alberto Gotta","affiliation":["National Research Council of Italy (CNR), Information Science and Technologies Institute (ISTI), Pisa, Italy"],"firstName":"Alberto","lastName":"Gotta","id":"37296821600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-0162-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1930-0395"}],"articleNumber":"6984950","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":16,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":556},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wireless sensor networks","Data models","Agriculture","Zigbee","Mathematical model","Transmitting antennas","Global Positioning System"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["agricultural engineering","autonomous aerial vehicles","radiowave propagation","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["UAV","agricultural application","WSN","two-ray radio propagation model analysis","mobile node","flying node","two-ray path loss model","ground wireless sensor network control","unmanned aerial vehicle"]}],"abstract":"In this work, we discuss the radio propagation model of the UAVs when they act as mobile nodes belonging to a ground wireless sensor network.

While viscous forces acting onto large areas of laterally oscillating microstructures are well understood, there are contributions to the air damping that receive less attention. These include pressure forces, the effects of regularly placed holes perforating the large surfaces as well as forces exerted onto the typically much smaller side faces. The results of our analytic models are backed up with very good agreement by finite volume method simulations with the open source software OpenFOAM\u00ae as well as measurements. Since the read-out of our MOEMS sensor is optical, it does not involve highly complicated comb-drive geometries that are hard to model. Thus, our semi-numerical model describes the damping behavior of the MOEMS very accurately.","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6985067/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Nov. 2014","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"2-5 Nov. 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6985067/","dateOfInsertion":"15 December 2014","publicationDate":"Nov. 2014","accessionNumber":"14833961","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Air damping model for laterally oscillating MOEMS vibration sensors","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Air damping model for laterally oscillating MOEMS vibration sensors","confLoc":"Valencia, Spain","sourcePdf":"1695.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063025S","chronDate":"2-5 Nov. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6971895","isNumber":"6984913","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6971895","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6984913","articleId":"6985067","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":6985074,"authors":[{"name":"Erez Tadmor","affiliation":["Advanced Imaging Technologies Group, Microsoft R&D Center Haifa, Israel"],"firstName":"Erez","lastName":"Tadmor","id":"37085415977"},{"name":"Idan Bakish","affiliation":["Advanced Imaging Technologies Group, Microsoft R&D Center Haifa, Israel"],"firstName":"Idan","lastName":"Bakish","id":"38467600500"},{"name":"Shlomo Felzenshtein","affiliation":["Advanced Imaging Technologies Group, Microsoft R&D Center Haifa, Israel"],"firstName":"Shlomo","lastName":"Felzenshtein","id":"37085561392"},{"name":"Eli Larry","affiliation":["Advanced Imaging Technologies Group, Microsoft R&D Center Haifa, Israel"],"firstName":"Eli","lastName":"Larry","id":"37085547608"},{"name":"Giora Yahav","affiliation":["Advanced Imaging Technologies Group, Microsoft R&D Center Haifa, Israel"],"firstName":"Giora","lastName":"Yahav","id":"37293822600"},{"name":"David Cohen","affiliation":["Advanced Imaging Technologies Group, Microsoft R&D Center Haifa, Israel"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Cohen","id":"37085425772"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-0162-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1930-0395"}],"articleNumber":"6985074","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":429},"abstract":"This paper presents a method to realize a fast and uniform global shutter for time resolved imaging in standard, commercially available image sensors. Fast toggling of the substrate voltage is used in image sensors with a Vertical Overflow Drain (VOD) shutter mechanism, a common building block of IT-CCDs. Special measurements and analysis techniques were developed in order to characterize the shutter performance. Results show very good performance, with various potential applications such as Time-of-Flight imaging, transient imaging, and Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging Microscopy. Using off-the-shelf devices we were able to produce shutter rise and fall times of 1.5ns, and shutter contrast ratio of 1:50 or better. The global shutter temporal behavior is very uniform, with less than 200ps delay between the periphery and the center measured across 1/4\" and 1/3\" sensors. Moreover, neighboring pixels exhibit less than 50ps timing variation. The physical principles that allow this fast operation are discussed in detail and explained through measurement results supported by device simulations.","displayPublicationTitle":"SENSORS, 2014 IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel7/6971895/6984913/06985074.pdf","startPage":"618","endPage":"621","publicationTitle":"SENSORS, 2014 IEEE","doi":"10.1109/ICSENS.2014.6985074","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSENS.2014.6985074","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6984913","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6985074","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A fast global shutter image sensor based on the VOD mechanism","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Substrates","Image sensors","Photodiodes","Logic gates","Standards"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CCD image sensors","CMOS image sensors","fluorescence","optical microscopy","time resolved spectra"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FLIM","global shutter temporal behavior","off-the-shelf devices","fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy","transient imaging","time-of-flight imaging","IT-CCD","vertical overflow drain","time resolved imaging","VOD mechanism","global shutter image sensor"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Charge coupled device (CCD)","Time resolved","Time-of-Flight (TOF)","Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging Microscopy (FLIM)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6985074/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Nov. 2014","displayDocTitle":"A fast global shutter image sensor based on the VOD mechanism","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6985074/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2014","accessionNumber":"14833697","dateOfInsertion":"15 December 2014","conferenceDate":"2-5 Nov. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A fast global shutter image sensor based on the VOD mechanism","confLoc":"Valencia, Spain","sourcePdf":"1175.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078611S","chronDate":"2-5 Nov. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6971895","isNumber":"6984913","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6971895","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"6984913","articleId":"6985074","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6985086,"authors":[{"name":"Binu Baby Narakathu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Western Michigan University, Kalamazoo, MI, USA"],"firstName":"Binu Baby","lastName":"Narakathu","id":"37992950400"},{"name":"Sai Guruva Reddy Avuthu","affiliation":["Western Michigan University, Kalamazoo, MI, US"],"firstName":"Sai Guruva Reddy","lastName":"Avuthu","id":"37085540373"},{"name":"Ali Eshkeiti","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Western Michigan University, Kalamazoo, MI, USA"],"firstName":"Ali","lastName":"Eshkeiti","id":"38548070800"},{"name":"Sepehr Emamian","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Western Michigan University, Kalamazoo, MI, USA"],"firstName":"Sepehr","lastName":"Emamian","id":"37085353452"},{"name":"Massood Zandi Atashbar","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Western Michigan University, Kalamazoo, MI, USA"],"firstName":"Massood Zandi","lastName":"Atashbar","id":"37295958200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-0162-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1930-0395"}],"articleNumber":"6985086","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":291},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6985086","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Microfluidics","Sensors","Printing","Chemicals","Substrates","Impedance","Positron emission tomography"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biosensors","chemical sensors","chemical variables measurement","electrodes","microchannel flow","microfabrication","microsensors","polymers","printed circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["printed flexible microfluidic sensing platform","PCB technology","MSP","biochemical detection","interdigitated electrode","IDE","inkjet printing silver based ink","flexible polyethylene terephthalate substrate","printed circuit board technology","polydimethylsiloxane","PDMS","microfluidic channel","printed PET substrate","electrical impedance spectroscopy","EIS","picomolar detection"]}],"abstract":"A novel printed microfluidic sensing platform (MSP) has been successfully developed for the detection of bio/chemicals.

In this work we present a sensor operating at 4.33 MHz and consuming 0.77 mW for environmental monitoring. The sensor comprises a polymer-functionalized CMUT resonator in the feedback loop of a Colpitts oscillator. We fabricated the CMUT resonators using a novel process based on anodic bonding. The cavities and bottom electrodes are formed on a borosilicate glass wafer. The device layer of an SOI wafer bonded on glass forms the vibrating plate on top of vacuum-sealed cavities. This fabrication approach reduces process complexity and helps minimize parasitic components. CMUTs with center frequencies in the 3-50 MHz range with Q-factors as high as ~400 have successfully been fabricated. We used a 4.52-MHz device (Q=180) coated with a thin layer of polyisobutylene (PIB) for sensor demonstration.","doi":"10.1109/ICSENS.2014.6985089","publicationTitle":"SENSORS, 2014 IEEE","displayPublicationTitle":"SENSORS, 2014 IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel7/6971895/6984913/06985089.pdf","startPage":"677","endPage":"680","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6984913","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSENS.2014.6985089","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Nov. 2014","displayDocTitle":"A low-power gas sensor for environmental monitoring using a capacitive micromachined ultrasonic transducer","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6985089/","conferenceDate":"2-5 Nov. 2014","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"15 December 2014","publicationDate":"Nov. 2014","accessionNumber":"14833742","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6985089/","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A low-power gas sensor for environmental monitoring using a capacitive micromachined ultrasonic transducer","confLoc":"Valencia, Spain","sourcePdf":"1880.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040208S","chronDate":"2-5 Nov. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6971895","isNumber":"6984913","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6971895","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"6984913","articleId":"6985089","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-16"},{"_id":6985106,"authors":[{"name":"Takahiro Yamashita","affiliation":["NMEMS Technology Research Organization, Ibaraki, Japan","Research Center for Ubiquitous MEMS and Micro Engineering, National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology, Ibaraki, Japan"],"firstName":"Takahiro","lastName":"Yamashita","id":"37085459485"},{"name":"Yi Zhang","affiliation":["NMEMS Technology Research Organization, Ibaraki, Japan","Research Center for Ubiquitous MEMS and Micro Engineering, National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology, Ibaraki, Japan"],"firstName":"Yi","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37085456787"},{"name":"Hironao Okada","affiliation":["NMEMS Technology Research Organization, Ibaraki, Japan","Research Center for Ubiquitous MEMS and Micro Engineering, National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology, Ibaraki, Japan"],"firstName":"Hironao","lastName":"Okada","id":"37288615900"},{"name":"Toshihiro Itoh","affiliation":["NMEMS Technology Research Organization, Ibaraki, Japan","Research Center for Ubiquitous MEMS and Micro Engineering, National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology, Ibaraki, Japan"],"firstName":"Toshihiro","lastName":"Itoh","id":"37279606700"},{"name":"Ryutaro Maeda","affiliation":["NMEMS Technology Research Organization, Ibaraki, Japan","Research Center for Ubiquitous MEMS and Micro Engineering, National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology, Ibaraki, Japan"],"firstName":"Ryutaro","lastName":"Maeda","id":"38259882500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-0162-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1930-0395"}],"articleNumber":"6985106","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":169},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Windings","Cable TV","Area measurement","Sensors","Coercive force","Wires","Laser beam cutting"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cables (electric)","coils","electric resistance","electric sensing devices","electromagnetic induction","flexible electronics","silver","thin film sensors","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electrical cables","electric resistance","electromagnetic induction","wireless terminals","screen printing","process technology","printed silver paste coil","green wireless sensor network","thin film based flexible current clamp sensor fabrication","current 0 A to 100 A","voltage 69 mV","temperature 80 degC"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["battery-less","coil","current sensor","film","wireless sensor networks"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6985106","doi":"10.1109/ICSENS.2014.6985106","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSENS.2014.6985106","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6984913","publicationTitle":"SENSORS, 2014 IEEE","displayPublicationTitle":"SENSORS, 2014 IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel7/6971895/6984913/06985106.pdf","startPage":"742","endPage":"745","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Thin film based flexible current clamp sensor for green wireless sensor networks","abstract":"This paper presents a novel film based flexible clamp type current sensor for green wireless sensor networks fabricated by printed silver paste coil using the process technology in screen-printing as a low cost, simple, and rapid method.

In addition, it can construct wireless sensor networks easily because wireless terminals can drive autonomously without external power supply by utilizing the secondary current generated in the coil of the sensor by electromagnetic induction. The sensor's output voltage changed linearly with variation of the value of primary current in the 0 to 100 A range. When the value of primary current was 100 A, the output voltage was 69 mV per 150 turns in the coil. Although the ambient temperature around the sensor was raised at 80 \u00b0C due to heat evolved by the electric resistance of the coil, there was no almost variation of the voltage.

Although advances in sensors, embedded systems, wireless communication and intelligent information technologies has brought us tiny wearable ECG devices and efficient algorithms to continuously monitor and analyze ECG signals, energy consumption is a critical concern for practical usage. In this study, we examine three possible models of data transmissions - transmitting all data in real time (type 1), transmitting all data in batch periodically (type 2), or only transmitting the detected events (type 3), in which the third model is our proposed method. A simulated environment and a generic energy consumption model are developed to examine the influence of different strategies and Ventricular Fibrillation (VF) detection methods on energy consumption.","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6985162/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Nov. 2014","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"2-5 Nov. 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6985162/","dateOfInsertion":"15 December 2014","publicationDate":"Nov. 2014","accessionNumber":"14827014","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of energy consumption for wearable ECG devices","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of energy consumption for wearable ECG devices","confLoc":"Valencia, Spain","sourcePdf":"1491.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049053S","chronDate":"2-5 Nov. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6971895","isNumber":"6984913","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6971895","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"6984913","articleId":"6985162","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6985213,"authors":[{"name":"Lauri Hallman","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Oulu, Oulu, Finland"],"firstName":"Lauri","lastName":"Hallman","id":"37887381300"},{"name":"Jaakko Huikari","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Oulu, Oulu, Finland"],"firstName":"Jaakko","lastName":"Huikari","id":"37085426122"},{"name":"Juha Kostamovaara","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Oulu, Oulu, Finland"],"firstName":"Juha","lastName":"Kostamovaara","id":"37273978100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-0162-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1930-0395"}],"articleNumber":"6985213","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":18,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":721},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Semiconductor lasers","Diode lasers","Waveguide lasers","Measurement by laser beam","Optical waveguides","Optical transmitters","Current measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["avalanche photodiodes","driver circuits","laser ranging","MOSFET circuits","photodetectors","semiconductor lasers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["single photon imaging applications","power laser transmitter","distance measurement","SPAD matrix","single photon avalanche diode","pulsed time of flight laser radar application","laser diode transmitter","avalanche transistor based circuit","enhanced gain switching","asymmetric waveguide structure","laser diode","MOSFET-based current driver","compact laser pulser","frequency 100 kHz","distance 50 m"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["laser diode driver","current pulse","laser rangefinder","MOSFET"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6985213","abstract":"A compact laser pulser emitting ~100 ps, ~10 W pulses at >100 kHz is presented.

The scheme predicts the MSBs of the selected pixel using previous-row pixel A/D conversion data, which enables significant reduction of A/D conversions steps on MSBs and the power consumption.

In contrast to standard message transfer, the scheme has the objective to reliably compute at a fusion center some function of the measurements taken by a set of spatially distributed sensor nodes (e.g., maximum temperature, mean pressure). The distinguishing property of the scheme is its ability to exploit the interference caused by concurrently transmitting sensor nodes in order to compute desired function-values much more efficiently than with standard interference-avoiding strategies. This means, at least in theory, a significantly reduced need for wireless resources and energy, which is a major concern in sensor network design. A first proof of concept should demonstrate that these performance gains can be realized in practice. Towards this end, the computation scheme has been implemented on self-developed software defined radio devices that establish an appropriate testbed. Based on this it turns out that in spite of practical impairments such as asynchronous channel-access, fading, and receiver noise, interference can indeed be beneficially exploited for analog function computation in sensor networks. The corresponding system design, however, fundamentally differs from that for standard message transfer.","displayPublicationTitle":"SENSORS, 2014 IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel7/6971895/6984913/06985230.pdf","startPage":"1224","endPage":"1227","publicationTitle":"SENSORS, 2014 IEEE","doi":"10.1109/ICSENS.2014.6985230","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSENS.2014.6985230","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6984913","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6985230","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analog computation over the wireless channel: A proof of concept","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Tin","Wireless sensor networks","Wireless communication","Radio frequency","Interference","Fading","Standards"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fading channels","interference suppression","sensor fusion","software radio","telecommunication network reliability","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wireless channel","receiver noise","channel fading","asynchronous channel-access","software defined radio devices","interference-avoiding strategy","distributed sensor nodes","fusion center","wireless transmission scheme"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6985230/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Nov. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Analog computation over the wireless channel: A proof of concept","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6985230/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2014","accessionNumber":"14833795","dateOfInsertion":"15 December 2014","conferenceDate":"2-5 Nov. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analog computation over the wireless channel: A proof of concept","confLoc":"Valencia, Spain","sourcePdf":"1159.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048706S","chronDate":"2-5 Nov. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6971895","isNumber":"6984913","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6971895","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"6984913","articleId":"6985230","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6985244,"authors":[{"name":"Miguel A.

The technique is based on injecting an extra DBA pump wave in the fiber to generate an additional Brillouin interaction to that used for sensing. Moreover, the bandwidth of the DBA is tailored to fit that of the pump pulses by deploying a wavelength modulation of the DBA pump that is synchronized to the pump. Experimental proof-of-concept results demonstrate a fivefold enhancement of the measurement range of a BDS, from 10.36 km to more than 50 km in this particular case. Moreover, it is found that the use of the DBA does not introduce any significant penalty in the detection signal-to-noise ratio, highlighting the potential of the technique to provide much larger sensing lengths.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optical fiber amplifiers","Scattering","Optical fiber sensors","Laser excitation","Modulation","Gain"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed sensors","fibre optic sensors","optical fibre amplifiers","optical modulation","optical pumping"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["detection signal-to-noise ratio","wavelength modulation","optical fiber","attenuation compensation","DBA","distributed Brillouin amplifier","BDS","Brillouin distributed sensors","pump pulses","Brillouin amplification","Brillouin distributed sensing"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Brillouin distributed sensors","Brillouin optical time domain analysis","Brillouin amplification"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICSENS.2014.6985369","publicationTitle":"SENSORS, 2014 IEEE","displayPublicationTitle":"SENSORS, 2014 IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel7/6971895/6984913/06985369.pdf","startPage":"1776","endPage":"1779","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6984913","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSENS.2014.6985369","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Brillouin distributed sensing assisted by Brillouin amplification of pump pulses","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6985369","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Brillouin distributed sensing assisted by Brillouin amplification of pump pulses","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6985369/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6985369/","accessionNumber":"14862412","conferenceDate":"2-5 Nov. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"15 December 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Nov. 2014","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Brillouin distributed sensing assisted by Brillouin amplification of pump pulses","confLoc":"Valencia, Spain","sourcePdf":"2017.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042682S","chronDate":"2-5 Nov. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6971895","isNumber":"6984913","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6971895","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6984913","articleId":"6985369","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6985371,"authors":[{"name":"Michael A.

Their sensing behaviors are mainly determined by geometrical changes of the embedded microchannels, which is caused by mechanical deformation of the soft structures. In order to control the cross-sectional changes of the microchannels for desired sensor responses, we propose to add solid non-conductive microbeads in the microchannels. Using finite element analysis, we evaluated the influence of the embedded microbeads on the pressure response of soft sensors. We also experimentally compared the pressure responses of soft sensors with rectangular microchannels by changing the number of the beads. Our preliminary results from simulation and experiments showed that the embedded microbeads improved the pressure response of the soft sensors in terms of their linearity, sensitivity, and dynamic range.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improved pressure response with embedded solid microbeads in microfluidic soft sensors","publicationTitle":"SENSORS, 2014 IEEE","doi":"10.1109/ICSENS.2014.6985372","displayPublicationTitle":"SENSORS, 2014 IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel7/6971895/6984913/06985372.pdf","startPage":"1788","endPage":"1791","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSENS.2014.6985372","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6984913","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6985372","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6985372/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Nov. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Improved pressure response with embedded solid microbeads in microfluidic soft sensors","conferenceDate":"2-5 Nov. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6985372/","dateOfInsertion":"15 December 2014","publicationDate":"Nov. 2014","accessionNumber":"14833734","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improved pressure response with embedded solid microbeads in microfluidic soft sensors","confLoc":"Valencia, Spain","sourcePdf":"2053.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046728S","chronDate":"2-5 Nov. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6971895","isNumber":"6984913","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6971895","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6984913","articleId":"6985372","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":6985373,"authors":[{"name":"Md.

This method relies on fringing field capacitive measurements. A change in pH of the medium results in a permittivity change for the fringing electric field, which in turn affects the capacitance values. Capacitance changes are then converted to resonant frequency shifts via a readout circuit. This technique provides high sensitivity, low hysteresis, and low noise as well as low fabrication cost. Very importantly, the device and the corresponding measurement circuitry have the potential to be integrated in an electronic pill for continuous non-invasive measurement within the body.","doi":"10.1109/ICSENS.2014.6985373","startPage":"1792","endPage":"1794","displayPublicationTitle":"SENSORS, 2014 IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel7/6971895/6984913/06985373.pdf","publicationTitle":"SENSORS, 2014 IEEE","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSENS.2014.6985373","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6984913","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A MEMS capacitive pH sensor for high acidic and basic solutions","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Semiconductor device measurement","Capacitance","Electrodes","Voltage-controlled oscillators","Sensors","Fabrication","Magnetic field measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["capacitance","capacitive sensors","chemical sensors","microsensors","permittivity","pH measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MEMS capacitive pH sensor","high acidic solutions","basic solutions","microscale chip-based pH sensing system","permittivity","capacitance","fringing field capacitive measurements"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["pH sensor","MEMS","capacitive","fringing field"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6985373/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Nov. 2014","displayDocTitle":"A MEMS capacitive pH sensor for high acidic and basic solutions","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6985373/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"15 December 2014","conferenceDate":"2-5 Nov. 2014","accessionNumber":"14833987","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A MEMS capacitive pH sensor for high acidic and basic solutions","confLoc":"Valencia, Spain","sourcePdf":"2054.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048312S","chronDate":"2-5 Nov. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6971895","isNumber":"6984913","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6971895","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6984913","articleId":"6985373","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6985430,"authors":[{"name":"Akihito Noda","affiliation":["Graduate School of Frontier Sciences, The University of Tokyo, Kashiwa-shi Chiba"],"firstName":"Akihito","lastName":"Noda","id":"37395293300"},{"name":"Yuji Yamakawa","affiliation":["Graduate School of Information Science and Technology, The University of Tokyo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo"],"firstName":"Yuji","lastName":"Yamakawa","id":"37569560500"},{"name":"Masatoshi Ishikawa","affiliation":["Graduate School of Information Science and Technology, The University of Tokyo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo"],"firstName":"Masatoshi","lastName":"Ishikawa","id":"37276508700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-0162-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1930-0395"}],"articleNumber":"6985430","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":77},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Target tracking","Machine vision","Synchronization","Robustness","Data communication","Protocols","Educational institutions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer vision","object tracking","target tracking"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["target tracking","networked high-speed vision system","occlusion problem","computer vision"]}],"abstract":"This paper is concerned with robust target tracking of a high-speed moving object using a networked high-speed vision system.

In Ziggurat based normal random number generator, most of the normal random numbers are generated with simple integer operations, however for small percentage of the random numbers it is required to evaluate elementary natural logarithm and exponential functions. For an accurate evaluation of these elementary functions a run-time reconfigurable CORDIC core is implemented in this work. The run-time reconfiguration is required to minimize the additional resource requirements if multiple instance of the core is used for the evaluation of the individual functions. To further speedup the random number generation process, an effective method for parallel accessing the coefficients required by the Ziggurat algorithm is presented.

However, D2D communications can also serve as a technology component for providing public protection and disaster relief (PPDR) and national security and public safety (NSPS) services. In the United States, for example, spectrum has been reserved in the 700-MHz band for an LTE-based public safety network. The key requirement for the evolving broadband PPDR and NSPS services capable systems is to provide access to cellular services when the infrastructure is available and to efficiently support local services even if a subset or all of the network nodes become dysfunctional due to public disaster or emergency situations. This paper reviews some of the key requirements, technology challenges, and solution approaches that must be in place in order to enable LTE networks and, in particular, D2D communications, to meet PPDR and NSPS-related requirements. In particular, we propose a clustering-procedure-based approach to the design of a system that integrates cellular and ad hoc operation modes depending on the availability of infrastructure nodes. System simulations demonstrate the viability of the proposed design. The proposed scheme is currently considered as a technology component of the evolving 5G concept developed by the European 5G research project METIS.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Device-to-Device Communications for National Security and Public Safety","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2014.2379938","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/6705689/06985517.pdf","startPage":"1510","endPage":"1520","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2014.2379938","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6705689","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6985517","topic":"5G Wireless Technologies: Perspectives of the Next Generation Mobile Communications and Networking","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6985517/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 December 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"2014","displayDocTitle":"Device-to-Device Communications for National Security and Public Safety","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"2","htmlLink":"/document/6985517/","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"2014","accessionNumber":"14860608","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"European Union within the 7th Framework Programme through the Mobile and Wireless Communications Enablers for the Twenty-Twenty Information Society Project","grantNumber":"ITC 317669"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001729","fundingName":"Swedish Foundation for Strategic Research through the Strategic Mobility Matthew Project","grantNumber":"SM13-0008"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Device-to-Device Communications for National Security and Public Safety","sourcePdf":"access-fodor-2379938-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.042646S","chronDate":"2014","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"6705689","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"99","xplore-issue":"6705689","topics":["5G Wireless Technologies: Perspectives of the Next Generation Mobile Communications and Networking"],"articleId":"6985517","onlineDate":"18 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6985519,"authors":[{"name":"Rajesh K.

However, due to the increasingly pervasive existence of smart wireless devices in cognitive radio networks (CRNs), CR systems are vulnerable to numerous security threats that affect the overall performance. There have been many significant advances on security threats and countermeasures in CRNs in the past few years. Our main goal in this paper is to present the state-of-the-art research results and approaches proposed for CRN security to protect both unlicensed secondary users and licensed primary users. Specifically, we present the recent advances on security threats/attacks and countermeasures in CRNs focusing more on the physical layer by categorizing them in terms of their types, their existence in the CR cycle, network protocol layers (exploited during their activities and defense strategies), and game theoretic approaches. The recent important attacks and countermeasures in CRNs are also summarized in the form of tables. We also present recommendations that can be followed while implementing countermeasures to enhance CRN security. With this paper, readers can have a more thorough understanding of CRN security attacks and countermeasures, as well as research trends in this area.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6985519/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Secondquarter  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 December 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"17","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Secondquarter 2015","dateOfInsertion":"11 April 2019","accessionNumber":"15143370","htmlLink":"/document/6985519/","displayDocTitle":"Advances on Security Threats and Countermeasures for Cognitive Radio Networks: A Survey","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"CNS-1405670"},{"fundingName":"Carl-Zeiss Foundation, Germany"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Advances on Security Threats and Countermeasures for Cognitive Radio Networks: A Survey","sourcePdf":"comst-rawat-2380998-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.301043S","chronDate":"Secondquarter  2015","xplore-pub-id":"9739","isNumber":"7110413","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9739","citationCount":"142","xplore-issue":"7110413","articleId":"6985519","onlineDate":"18 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6985520,"authors":[{"name":"Jeremie Renaudier","affiliation":["Alcatel-Lucent Bell Laboratories, Nozay, France"],"bio":{"p":["Jeremie Renaudier (M\u201907) received the M.S. degree in optical\n communications and networks from Telecom Bretagne, Brest, France, in 2002, and the Ph.D. degree from the Telecom\n Paris, Paris, France, in 2006.

In practice, these systems are the result of a physical problem for which there is a partial knowledge either on the sensors from which the observations are issued or on the state of the studied system. We therefore propose in this work an \u201cExpectation-Maximization\u201d learning type algorithm that takes into account constraints on parameters such as the fact that two identical sensors have the same noise characteristics, and so estimation procedure should exploit this knowledge. The algorithms are designed for the pairwise linear Gaussian system that takes into account supplementary cross-dependences between observations and hidden states w.r.t. the conventional linear system, while still allowing optimal filtering by means of a Kalman-like filter. The algorithm is made robust through QR decompositions and the propagation of a square-root of the covariance matrices instead of the matrices themselves. It is assessed through a series of experiments that compare the algorithms which incorporate or not partial knowledge, for short as well as for long signals.","doi":"10.1109/TAC.2014.2381032","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","pdfPath":"/iel7/9/7225196/06985529.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAC.2014.2381032","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7225196","startPage":"2518","endPage":"2523","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust Partial-Learning in Linear Gaussian Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6985529","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Robust Partial-Learning in Linear Gaussian Systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6985529/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 December 2014","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"60","issue":"9","publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","accessionNumber":"15400741","dateOfInsertion":"26 August 2015","htmlLink":"/document/6985529/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"French Direction G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de l'Armement (DGA)"},{"fundingName":"CNRS"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust Partial-Learning in Linear Gaussian Systems","sourcePdf":"tac-nemesin-2381032-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.124158S","chronDate":"Sept.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"9","isNumber":"7225196","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"7225196","articleId":"6985529","onlineDate":"18 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6985532,"authors":[{"name":"Bin Li","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics and Statistics, Curtin University, Perth, WA, Australia"],"firstName":"Bin","lastName":"Li","id":"37085390785"},{"name":"Hai Huyen Dam","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics and Statistics, Curtin University, Perth, WA, Australia"],"firstName":"Hai Huyen","lastName":"Dam","id":"37085431730"},{"name":"Antonio Cantoni","affiliation":["School of Electrical, Electronic and Computer Engineering, The University of Western Australia, Crawley, WA, Australia"],"firstName":"Antonio","lastName":"Cantoni","id":"37269399500"},{"name":"Kok Lay Teo","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics and Statistics, Curtin University, Perth, WA, Australia"],"firstName":"Kok Lay","lastName":"Teo","id":"37278330500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"6985532","dbTime":"21 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":507},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Acceleration","Gradient methods","Convergence","Vectors","Complexity theory","Information rates","Australia"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","gradient methods","MIMO communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["first order optimal zero forcing beamformer design","multiuser MIMO systems","regularized dual accelerated gradient method","MU-MIMO systems","perantenna power constraints","first order methods","accelerated method"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Zero-forcing beamforming (ZFBF)","MIMO systems","first-order method"]},{"kwd":["Zero-forcing beamforming (ZFBF)","per-antenna power constraint (PAPC)","MIMO systems","first-order method","accelerated gradient method"]}],"abstract":"A first-order zero-forcing beamformer design is proposed in this letter for MU-MIMO systems under per-antenna power constraints (PAPC).

To demonstrate the method, a two-element microstrip antenna array with the proposed network has been designed, fabricated and measured. Both simulated and measured results have simultaneously proved that the proposed method presents excellent decoupling performance. The measured mutual coupling can be reduced to below -58 dB at center frequency. Meanwhile it has little influence on return loss and radiation patterns.

To integrate a polarization beam splitter (PBS), two polarization rotators, four-optical hybrids, and 16 high-speed photodiodes (PDs) in one chip, we employed a 5%-\u0394 waveguide with a minimum bending radius of 300 \u03bcm, and the heterogeneous integration of InP-PDs. To achieve a compact receiver without any degradation in optical passive performance, we also investigated a three-branched spot size converter with a low loss and a high-fabrication tolerance and a waveplate type PBS with a high-polarization extinction ratio. Using these techniques, we fabricated a dual-carrier dual-polarization (DP) 16-level quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) receiver PLC, and successfully demonstrated 32-Gbaud DP-16QAM signal demodulation for each channel.","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/50/7054612/06985541.pdf","startPage":"1202","endPage":"1209","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2014.2380814","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2014.2380814","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7054612","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6985541","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Heterogeneously Integrated PLC With Low-Loss Spot-Size Converter and Newly Developed Waveplate PBS for DC-DP-16QAM Receiver","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optical waveguides","Optical device fabrication","Optical receivers","High-speed optical techniques","Adaptive optics","Optical polarization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["demodulation","optical receivers","photodiodes","polarisation","quadrature amplitude modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["heterogeneously integrated PLC","low-loss spot-size converter","waveplate PBS","DC-DP-16QAM receiver","digital coherent transmission systems","multicarrier modulation formats","multilevel modulation formats","one-chip 400-G coherent receiver","silica-based planar lightwave circuit","PLC integration platform","polarization beam splitter","polarization rotators","high-speed photodiodes","optical passive performance","high-polarization extinction ratio","dual-carrier dual-polarization","16-level quadrature amplitude modulation","QAM receiver PLC","32-Gbaud DP-16QAM signal demodulation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Heterogeneous integration","photonic integration circuits","grass waveguides","photodiode","spot-size converter","polarization beam splitter","optical 90\u00b0 hybrid","coherent receiver","optical fiber communication","digital coherent"]},{"kwd":["Coherent receiver","digital coherent","grass waveguides","heterogeneous integration","optical 90\u00b0 hybrid","optical fiber communication","photodiode","photonic integration circuits","polarization beam splitter","spot-size converter"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6985541/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March15, 15 2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 December 2014","displayDocTitle":"Heterogeneously Integrated PLC With Low-Loss Spot-Size Converter and Newly Developed Waveplate PBS for DC-DP-16QAM Receiver","volume":"33","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/6985541/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"15 March15, 2015","accessionNumber":"14982612","dateOfInsertion":"09 March 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Heterogeneously Integrated PLC With Low-Loss Spot-Size Converter and Newly Developed Waveplate PBS for DC-DP-16QAM Receiver","sourcePdf":"jlt-kurata-2380814-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.090646S","chronDate":"March15, 15 2015","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"7054612","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7054612","articleId":"6985541","onlineDate":"18 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6985548,"authors":[{"name":"Mu'ath J.

The proposed EBG structure without the use of metallic vias or vertical components is formed by etching two slots and adding two connecting bridges to a conventional uniplanar EBG unit-cell. The transmission characteristics of the proposed EBG structure are measured. Results show that the proposed EBG structure has a wide bandgap around the 60 GHz band. The size of the proposed EBG unit-cell is 78% less than a conventional uniplanar EBG, and 72% less than a uniplanar-compact EBG (UC-EBG) operating at the same frequency band. Moreover, and despite the fabrication limitations at the 60 GHz band, the proposed EBG unit-cell provides at least 12% more size reduction than any other planar EBG structures at microwave frequencies. Its enhanced performance and applicability to reduce mutual coupling in antenna arrays are then investigated. Results show a drastic decrease in the mutual coupling level. This EBG structure can find its applications in MMW wireless communication systems.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel7/8/7027885/06985548.pdf","startPage":"823","endPage":"828","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2014.2381229","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2014.2381229","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7027885","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6985548","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Millimeter-Wave Compact EBG Structure for Mutual Coupling Reduction Applications","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Metamaterials","Antenna arrays","Antenna measurements","Mutual coupling","Photonic band gap"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["millimetre wave antenna arrays","millimetre wave couplers","photonic band gap"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["millimeterwave compact EBG structure","MMW EBG","metallic vias","wide bandgap","uniplanar-compact EBG","UC-EBG","antenna arrays","MMW wireless communication systems"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Dielectric resonator (DR) antenna","electromagnetic bandgap (EBG)","millimeter-wave (MMW)","multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) systems","mutual coupling (MC)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6985548/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 December 2014","displayDocTitle":"Millimeter-Wave Compact EBG Structure for Mutual Coupling Reduction Applications","volume":"63","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/6985548/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2015","accessionNumber":"14914960","dateOfInsertion":"30 January 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Millimeter-Wave Compact EBG Structure for Mutual Coupling Reduction Applications","sourcePdf":"tap-alhasan-2381229-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.067873S","chronDate":"Feb.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"7027885","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"72","xplore-issue":"7027885","articleId":"6985548","onlineDate":"18 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-29"},{"_id":6985550,"authors":[{"name":"Liang Yang","affiliation":["School of Information Engineering, Tianjin University of Commerce, Tianjin, China","State Key Laboratory of Information Security, Institute of Information Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6221036/7297778/6985550/yang-2377154-small.gif","p":["Liang Yang received the B.E. and M.E. degrees in computational mathematics from Nankai University, Tianjin, China, in 2004 and 2007, respectively.

In real world, topology information alone is often inadequate to accurately find community structure due to its sparsity and noises. However, potential useful prior information can be obtained from domain knowledge in many applications. Thus, how to improve the community detection performance by combining network topology with prior information becomes an interesting and challenging problem. Previous efforts on utilizing such priors are either dedicated or insufficient. In this paper, we firstly present a unified interpretation to a group of existing community detection methods. And then based on this interpretation, we propose a unified semi-supervised framework to integrate network topology with prior information for community detection. If the prior information indicates that some nodes belong to the same community, we encode it by adding a graph regularization term to penalize the latent space dissimilarity of these nodes. This framework can be applied to many widely-used matrix-based community detection methods satisfying our interpretation, such as nonnegative matrix factorization, spectral clustering, and their variants. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real networks show that the proposed framework significantly improves the accuracy of community detection, especially on networks with unclear structures.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Communities","Topology","Detection algorithms","Network topology","Symmetric matrices","Image edge detection","Clustering

First, an accurate near-field approximation is proposed, based on which the circular wavefront curvature of spherical waves can be compensated by mapping the images to a rectified new grid. More importantly, the near-field approximation makes the two dimensions of the scattered data separable for the range and cross-range directions, which makes it possible to solve the 2-D reflectivity matrix for the image reconstruction directly. Then, a 2-D proximal subgradient algorithm for near-field radar imaging based on a fast iterative shrinkage/thresholding algorithm (FISTA) is introduced to resolve the memory usage and computation time issues. Simulation and experimental results are provided to demonstrate the performance of the proposed method with comparisons to the traditional Fourier-based method and to the conjugate gradient (CG) based method, which proves that the proposed method is an effective way to solve the near-field radar imaging problem.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Near-Field Radar Imaging via Compressive Sensing","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2014.2381262","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel7/8/7027885/06985554.pdf","startPage":"828","endPage":"833","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2014.2381262","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7027885","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6985554","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6985554/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 December 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2015","displayDocTitle":"Near-Field Radar Imaging via Compressive Sensing","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"63","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/6985554/","dateOfInsertion":"30 January 2015","publicationDate":"Feb. 2015","accessionNumber":"14914962","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Program on Basic Research Project of China","grantNumber":"2010CB327505"},{"fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61301191"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Near-Field Radar Imaging via Compressive Sensing","sourcePdf":"tap-li-2381262-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.160103S","chronDate":"Feb.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"7027885","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"7027885","articleId":"6985554","onlineDate":"18 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6985561,"authors":[{"name":"Quan Yuan","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics, Wayne State University, Detroit, MI, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/9/7132652/6985561/yuan-2381454-small.gif","p":["\nQuan Yuan received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in mathematics from East \nChina University of Science and Technology, Shanghai, China, in 2001 and 2004, respectively.

A number of works have been devoted to analyzing the convergence of the underlying algorithms. Nevertheless, in most cases, rather simplified hypotheses are used. For example, it often assumes that the swarm has only one particle. In addition, more often than not, the variables and the points of attraction are assumed to remain constant throughout the optimization process. In reality, such assumptions are often violated. Moreover, there are no rigorous rates of convergence results available to date for the particle swarm, to the best of our knowledge. In this paper, we consider a general form of PSO algorithms, and analyze asymptotic properties of the algorithms using stochastic approximation methods. We introduce four coefficients and rewrite the PSO procedure as a stochastic approximation type iterative algorithm. Then we analyze its convergence using weak convergence method. It is proved that a suitably scaled sequence of swarms converge to the solution of an ordinary differential equation. We also establish certain stability results. Moreover, convergence rates are ascertained by using weak convergence method. A centered and scaled sequence of the estimation errors is shown to have a diffusion limit.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6985561/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 December 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2015","dateOfInsertion":"24 June 2015","publicationDate":"July 2015","accessionNumber":"15252234","htmlLink":"/document/6985561/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"60","issue":"7","isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Analyzing Convergence and Rates of Convergence of Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithms Using Stochastic Approximation Methods","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000183","fundingName":"Army Research Office","grantNumber":"W911NF-12-1-0223"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analyzing Convergence and Rates of Convergence of Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithms Using Stochastic Approximation Methods","sourcePdf":"tac-yin-2381454-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.102888S","chronDate":"July  2015","xplore-pub-id":"9","isNumber":"7132652","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"7132652","articleId":"6985561","onlineDate":"18 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6985562,"authors":[{"name":"Qisong Wu","affiliation":["Center for Advanced Communications, Villanova University, Villanova, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Qisong","lastName":"Wu","id":"37085375680"},{"name":"Yimin D.

A wideband circular-monopolar patch surrounded by eight reconfigurable coupling loop stubs can generate conical-beam radiation patterns with different polarizations. This polarization reconfigurable characteristic is realized by controlling PIN diodes on the coupling loop stubs. The center-fed circular patch operates with the vertically-polarized conical-beam radiation and the coupling loop stubs radiate the horizontally-polarized wave propagation. With choosing proper magnitudes and phase differences between the two orthogonal radiations from the monopolar patch and the loop stubs, a circularly-polarized conical-beam radiation can be obtained. In addition, the presence of a back reflector yields a wide axial ratio bandwidth, enhances the front-to-back ratio of the radiation pattern, and avoids EM interferences between DC biasing lines and the antenna. This proposed antenna can generate three types of polarizations with the conical-beam radiation pattern including vertical polarization, left-handed circular polarization, and right-handed circular polarization by controlling the PIN diodes. Measured impedance and axial ratio bandwidths are 28.6% (3.45 to 4.6 GHz) and 15.4% (3.6 to 4.2 GHz), respectively, for the two CP modes. The maximum CP gain is 4.4 dBic. Furthermore, a dual-band operation (3.35 to 3.44 GHz and 4.5 to 4.75 GHz) can be observed for the LP mode. The antenna can operate at the downlink of standard C band (3.625 to 4.2 GHz) for geostationary satellite communication.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6985569/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 December 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"63","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"30 January 2015","accessionNumber":"14914970","htmlLink":"/document/6985569/","displayDocTitle":"Polarization Reconfigurable Wheel-Shaped Antenna With Conical-Beam Radiation Pattern","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Research Grants Council of the Hong Kong SAR China"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Polarization Reconfigurable Wheel-Shaped Antenna With Conical-Beam Radiation Pattern","sourcePdf":"tap-wong-2381263-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.136518S","chronDate":"Feb.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"7027885","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"89","xplore-issue":"7027885","articleId":"6985569","onlineDate":"18 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6985570,"authors":[{"name":"Wen-Jiao Liao","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University of Science and Technology, Taipei, Taiwan, R.O.C."],"firstName":"Wen-Jiao","lastName":"Liao","id":"37532869200"},{"name":"Chen-Yu Hsieh","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University of Science and Technology, Taipei, Taiwan, R.O.C."],"firstName":"Chen-Yu","lastName":"Hsieh","id":"37085448276"},{"name":"Bang-Yun Dai","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University of Science and Technology, Taipei, Taiwan, R.O.C."],"firstName":"Bang-Yun","lastName":"Dai","id":"37085426818"},{"name":"Bo-Ren Hsiao","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University of Science and Technology, Taipei, Taiwan, R.O.C."],"firstName":"Bo-Ren","lastName":"Hsiao","id":"37085450168"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1536-1225"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1548-5757"}],"articleNumber":"6985570","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":48,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2264},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society","url":"http://www.ieeeaps.org/"}],"abstract":"A four-antenna system applicable to compact access points of wireless local area network is proposed.

The inverted-F antenna operates in the 5 GHz HiperLAN band and the slot functions in the 2.4 GHz ISM band. Antenna tuning can be done without difficulty because the two are of different antenna types. Four antenna assemblies are placed at corners of a 50 mm \u00d7 50 mm board to meet the multi-input multi-output operation needs. Since the element antenna exhibits moderate directivity and the four antennas are arranged in a rotational symmetry, decent isolations are achieved in both operation bands without additional decoupling measures. The antenna structure is fully planar and can be integrated within the printed circuit board, which makes it an attractive candidate for compact access point uses.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Wireless Propagation Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/7727/7024204/06985570.pdf","startPage":"847","endPage":"850","publicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Wireless Propagation Letters","doi":"10.1109/LAWP.2014.2381362","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LAWP.2014.2381362","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7024204","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6985570","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Inverted-F/Slot Integrated Dual-Band Four-Antenna System for WLAN Access Points","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Slot antennas","Antenna measurements","Wireless LAN","MIMO","Antenna radiation patterns"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","MIMO communication","slot antennas","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["inverted-F/slot integrated dual-band four-antenna system","compact access points","wireless local area network","antenna topology","HiperLAN band","ISM band","antenna tuning","multi-input multi-output operation","element antenna","rotational symmetry","antenna structure","printed circuit board","compact access point"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Antenna decoupling","diversity antenna","inverted-F antenna","miniaturized antennas","slot antenna","WLAN"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6985570/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 December 2014","displayDocTitle":"Inverted-F/Slot Integrated Dual-Band Four-Antenna System for WLAN Access Points","volume":"14","htmlLink":"/document/6985570/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2015","accessionNumber":"15018561","dateOfInsertion":"03 April 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003711","fundingName":"Ministry of Science and Technology","grantNumber":"MOST103-2221-E-011-014"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Inverted-F/Slot Integrated Dual-Band Four-Antenna System for WLAN Access Points","sourcePdf":"lawp-liao-2381362-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.078112S","chronDate":"2015","xplore-pub-id":"7727","isNumber":"7024204","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7727","citationCount":"48","xplore-issue":"7024204","articleId":"6985570","onlineDate":"18 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6985574,"authors":[{"name":"Mohamed Elhoseny","affiliation":["Department of Information Systems, Mansoura University, Mansoura, Egypt"],"firstName":"Mohamed","lastName":"Elhoseny","id":"37085340628"},{"name":"Xiaohui Yuan","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of North Texas, Denton, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Xiaohui","lastName":"Yuan","id":"37403856800"},{"name":"Zhengtao Yu","affiliation":["School of Information Technology and Automation, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming, China"],"firstName":"Zhengtao","lastName":"Yu","id":"37085643256"},{"name":"Cunli Mao","affiliation":["School of Information Technology and Automation, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming, China"],"firstName":"Cunli","lastName":"Mao","id":"37543429400"},{"name":"Hamdy K.

Compared with five state-of-the-art methods, our proposed method greatly extends the network life, and the average improvement with respect to the second best performance based on the first-node-die and the last-node-die is 33.8% and 13%, respectively. The balanced energy consumption greatly improves the network life and allows the sensor energy to deplete evenly. The computational efficiency of our method is comparable to the others and the overall average time across all experiments is 0.6 seconds with a standard deviation of 0.06.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6985574/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 December 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2015","volume":"19","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2015","publicationDate":"Dec. 2015","accessionNumber":"15661683","htmlLink":"/document/6985574/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Balancing Energy Consumption in Heterogeneous Wireless Sensor Networks Using Genetic Algorithm","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Balancing Energy Consumption in Heterogeneous Wireless Sensor Networks Using Genetic Algorithm","sourcePdf":"lcomm-yuan-2381226-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.076607S","chronDate":"Dec.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"4234","isNumber":"7349260","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4234","citationCount":"115","xplore-issue":"7349260","articleId":"6985574","onlineDate":"18 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6985580,"authors":[{"name":"Jumei Zhou","affiliation":["Collaborative Innovation Center of Advanced Microstructures, School of Electronic Science and Engineering, Nanjing University, Nanjing, China","Ningbo Institute of Material Technology and Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Ningbo, China"],"firstName":"Jumei","lastName":"Zhou","id":"38189196500"},{"name":"Ning Liu","affiliation":["Collaborative Innovation Center of Advanced Microstructures, School of Electronic Science and Engineering, Nanjing University, Nanjing, China","Ningbo Institute of Material Technology and Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Ningbo, China"],"firstName":"Ning","lastName":"Liu","id":"37085405885"},{"name":"Liqiang Zhu","affiliation":["Collaborative Innovation Center of Advanced Microstructures, School of Electronic Science and Engineering, Nanjing University, Nanjing, China","Ningbo Institute of Material Technology and Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Ningbo, China"],"firstName":"Liqiang","lastName":"Zhu","id":"37631480600"},{"name":"Yi Shi","affiliation":["Collaborative Innovation Center of Advanced Microstructures, School of Electronic Science and Engineering, Nanjing University, Nanjing, China","Ningbo Institute of Material Technology and Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Ningbo, China"],"firstName":"Yi","lastName":"Shi","id":"37085419937"},{"name":"Qing Wan","affiliation":["Collaborative Innovation Center of Advanced Microstructures, School of Electronic Science and Engineering, Nanjing University, Nanjing, China","Ningbo Institute of Material Technology and Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Ningbo, China"],"firstName":"Qing","lastName":"Wan","id":"37399374700"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0741-3106"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0563"}],"articleNumber":"6985580","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":67,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1946},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Electron Devices Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/eds/"}],"abstract":"Flexible low-voltage indium-gallium-zincoxide (IGZO) electric-double-layer transistors are fabricated on polyethylene terephthalate substrates at room temperature and proposed for energy-efficient artificial synapse application.

This involves, however, solving a challenging nonlinear and ill-posed electromagnetic inverse scattering problem. This paper presents a robust method for quantitative MWI in medical applications where very little, if any, a priori information on the imaging scenario is available. This is accomplished by employing a distorted Born iterative method and a regularization by projection technique, which reconstructs the tissue parameters using a wavelet basis expansion to represent the unknown contrast. This approach is suited for any microwave medical imaging application where the requirement for increased resolution dictates the use of higher frequency data and, consequently, a robust regularization strategy. To demonstrate the robustness of the proposed approach, this paper presents reconstructions of highly heterogeneous anatomically realistic numerical breast phantoms in a canonical 2-D configuration.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6985590/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 December 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"62","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2015","dateOfInsertion":"18 March 2015","accessionNumber":"15000291","htmlLink":"/document/6985590/","pubMedId":"25532165","displayDocTitle":"Wavelet-Based Regularization for Robust Microwave Imaging in Medical Applications","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Rosa Scapaticci's visit at King's College London"},{"fundingName":"Short Term Scientific Mission"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wavelet-Based Regularization for Robust Microwave Imaging in Medical Applications","sourcePdf":"tbme-crocco-2381270-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.14998S","chronDate":"April  2015","xplore-pub-id":"10","isNumber":"7061913","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"40","xplore-issue":"7061913","articleId":"6985590","onlineDate":"18 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6985593,"authors":[{"name":"Qing-Xin Chu","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8/7027885/6985593/6985593-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Qing-Xin Chu (M'99\u2013SM'11) received the B.S, M.E., and Ph.D. degrees in electronic engineering from Xidian University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China, in 1982, 1987, and 1994, respectively.","He is currently a Full Professor with the School of Electronic and Information Engineering, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China.

In this paper, we propose an energy efficient virtual network embedding (EEVNE) approach for cloud computing networks, where power savings are introduced by consolidating resources in the network and data centers. We model our approach in an IP over WDM network using mixed integer linear programming (MILP). The performance of the EEVNE approach is compared with two approaches from the literature: the bandwidth cost approach (CostVNE) and the energy aware approach (VNE-EA). The CostVNE approach optimizes the use of available bandwidth, while the VNE-EA approach minimizes the power consumption by reducing the number of activated nodes and links without taking into account the granular power consumption of the data centers and the different network devices. The results show that the EEVNE model achieves a maximum power saving of 60% (average 20%) compared to the CostVNE model under an energy inefficient data center power profile. We develop a heuristic, real-time energy optimized VNE (REOViNE), with power savings approaching those of the EEVNE model. We also compare the different approaches adopting an energy efficient data center power profile. Furthermore, we study the impact of delay and node location constraints on the energy efficiency of virtual network embedding. We also show how VNE can impact the design of optimally located data centers for minimal power consumption in cloud networks. Finally, we examine the power savings and spectral efficiency benefits that VNE offers in optical orthogonal division multiplexing networks.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 December 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"May1, 1 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6985595/","volume":"33","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/6985595/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15000557","isOpenAccess":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"1 May1, 2015","dateOfInsertion":"16 March 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Energy Efficient Virtual Network Embedding for Cloud Networks","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000266","fundingName":"Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)"},{"fundingName":"INTERNET","grantNumber":"EP/H040536/1"},{"fundingName":"STAR","grantNumber":"EP/K016873/1"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Energy Efficient Virtual Network Embedding for Cloud Networks","sourcePdf":"jlt-nonde-2380777-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.084838S","chronDate":"May1, 1 2015","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"7061558","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"114","xplore-issue":"7061558","articleId":"6985595","onlineDate":"18 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":6985604,"authors":[{"name":"Kamanashis Biswas","affiliation":["School of Information and Communication Technology, Griffith University, Gold Coast, QLD, Australia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7361/7057632/6985604/biswa-2380816-small.gif","p":["Kamanashis Biswas received the master\u2019s degree in security engineering from the Blekinge Institue of Technology, Karlskrona, Sweden, in 2007.

With the proliferation of sensor networks at home, work place, and beyond, securing data in the network has become a challenge. A number of security mechanisms have been proposed for sensor networks to provide data confidentiality: 1) advanced encryption system; 2) KATAN; 3) LED; and 4) TWINE. However, these schemes have drawbacks, including security vulnerabilities, need for hardware-based implementation, and higher computational complexity. To address these limitations, we propose a lightweight block cipher based on chaotic map and genetic operations. The proposed cryptographic scheme employs elliptic curve points to verify the communicating nodes and as one of the chaotic map parameters to generate the pseudorandom bit sequence. This sequence is used in XOR, mutation, and crossover operations in order to encrypt the data blocks. The experimental results based on Mica2 sensor mote show that the proposed encryption scheme is nine times faster than the LED protocol and two times faster than the TWINE protocol. We have also performed a number of statistical tests and cryptanalytic attacks to evaluate the security strength of the algorithm and found the cipher provably secure.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6985604/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 December 2014","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15018796","volume":"15","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/6985604/","publicationDate":"May 2015","dateOfInsertion":"26 March 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"An Encryption Scheme Using Chaotic Map and Genetic Operations for Wireless Sensor Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Encryption Scheme Using Chaotic Map and Genetic Operations for Wireless Sensor Networks","sourcePdf":"jsen-biswas-2380816-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.070565S","chronDate":"May  2015","xplore-pub-id":"7361","isNumber":"7057632","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7361","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"7057632","articleId":"6985604","onlineDate":"18 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6985606,"authors":[{"name":"Shuangying Zhong","affiliation":["School of Sciences, Nanchang University, Nanchang, Jiangxi, China"],"firstName":"Shuangying","lastName":"Zhong","id":"37716332400"},{"name":"Song Liu","affiliation":["School of Sciences, Nanchang University, Nanchang, Jiangxi, China","State Key Laboratory of Millimeter Waves, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China"],"firstName":"Song","lastName":"Liu","id":"37422775600"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-926X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2221"}],"articleNumber":"6985606","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":407},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society","url":"http://www.ieeeaps.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Force","Finite difference methods","Numerical stability","Time-domain analysis","Maxwell equations","Dispersion","Accuracy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dispersion (wave)","electromagnetic wave propagation","electromagnetic wave scattering","finite difference time-domain analysis","Maxwell equations","numerical stability","radar cross-sections"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["2D TM mode","RCS","back scattered radar cross sections","F-SFDTD method","dispersion analysis","numerical stability","time direction","third-order symplectic map","electromagnetic wave propagation characteristics","T + V type Hamiltonian decomposition","Maxwell equations","force-gradient SFDTD scheme","force-gradient symplectic finite-difference time-domain scheme"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) methods","force gradient","Maxwell's equations","symplectic integrator"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, a novel force-gradient explicit symplectic finite-difference time-domain (SFDTD) algorithm based on the T + V type Hamiltonian decomposition is derived to investigate the propagation characteristics of electromagnetic waves, in which Maxwell's equations are numerically integrated by third-order symplectic map combined with force gradient in the time direction.

The implementation of F-SFDTD method is easily applied to compute the back scattered radar cross sections (RCS) using 2-D TM mode for a perfectly conducting cylinder.","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2014.2381255","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel7/8/7027885/06985606.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2014.2381255","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7027885","startPage":"834","endPage":"838","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Force-Gradient Symplectic Finite-Difference Time-Domain Scheme for Maxwell's Equations","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6985606","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"The Force-Gradient Symplectic Finite-Difference Time-Domain Scheme for Maxwell's Equations","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6985606/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 December 2014","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"63","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 2015","accessionNumber":"14914953","dateOfInsertion":"30 January 2015","htmlLink":"/document/6985606/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Force-Gradient Symplectic Finite-Difference Time-Domain Scheme for Maxwell's Equations","sourcePdf":"tap-liu-2381255-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.059091S","chronDate":"Feb.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"7027885","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7027885","articleId":"6985606","onlineDate":"18 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6985614,"authors":[{"name":"Thomas Fromenteze","affiliation":["XLIM, University of Limoges, Limoges, France"],"bio":{"p":["Thomas Fromenteze, photograph and biography not available at the time of publication."]},"firstName":"Thomas","lastName":"Fromenteze","id":"37072390400"},{"name":"Cyril Decroze","affiliation":["XLIM, University of Limoges, Limoges, France"],"bio":{"p":["Cyril Decroze, photograph and biography not available at the time of publication."]},"firstName":"Cyril","lastName":"Decroze","id":"37314262500"},{"name":"David Carsenat","affiliation":["XLIM, University of Limoges, Limoges, France"],"bio":{"p":["David Carsenat, photograph and biography not available at the time of publication."]},"firstName":"David","lastName":"Carsenat","id":"37314261700"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-926X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2221"}],"articleNumber":"6985614","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":28,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":922},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society","url":"http://www.ieeeaps.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6985614","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Noise","Arrays","Array signal processing","Correlation","Multiplexing","Microwave imaging"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","array signal processing","beam steering","microwave imaging","multiplexing","orthogonal codes","ultra wideband antennas","waveform analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ultrawideband antenna","uncorrelated channel","orthogonal code","beamsteering","beamforming system","radar","microwave reception chain","antenna array","compact component","microwave imaging","passive multiplexing technique","waveform coding"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Beamforming","inverse problem","microwave imaging","passive technique","radar","ultrawideband (UWB)"]}],"abstract":"This paper proposes a novel passive technique for the collection of microwave images.

The preservation of the waveforms is ensured using orthogonal codes supplied by the propagation through the component's uncorrelated channels.

We classify mobile users into different groups to study the resource consumption in mobile Internet. We observe that traffic heavy users and high mobility users tend to consume massive data and radio resources simultaneously. Both the data usage and the mobility pattern are closely related to the application access behavior of the users. Users can be clustered through their application usage behavior, and application categories can be identified by the ways to attract the users. Our analysis provides an comprehensive understanding of user behavior in mobile Internet, which may be used by network operators to design appropriate mechanisms in resource provision and mobility

characterization, and material decomposition. In this paper, we are interested in kVp switching-based spectral CT that alternates distinct kVp X-ray transmissions during gantry rotation. This system can acquire multiple X-ray energy transmissions without additional radiation dose. However, only sparse views are generated for each spectral measurement; and the spectra themselves are limited in number. To address these limitations, we propose a penalized maximum likelihood method using spectral patch-based low-rank penalty, which exploits the self-similarity of patches that are collected at the same position in spectral images. The main advantage is that the relatively small number of materials within each patch allows us to employ the low-rank penalty that is less sensitive to intensity changes while preserving edge directions. In our optimization formulation, the cost function consists of the Poisson log-likelihood for X-ray transmission and the nonconvex patch-based low-rank penalty. Since the original cost function is difficult to minimize directly, we propose an optimization method using separable quadratic surrogate and concave convex procedure algorithms for the log-likelihood and penalty terms, which results in an alternating minimization that provides a computational advantage because each subproblem can be solved independently. We performed computer simulations and a real experiment using a kVp switching-based spectral CT with sparse-view measurements, and compared the proposed method with conventional algorithms. We confirmed that the proposed method improves spectral images both qualitatively and quantitatively. Furthermore, our GPU implementation significantly reduces the computational cost.","doi":"10.1109/TMI.2014.2380993","startPage":"748","endPage":"760","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMI.2014.2380993","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7051305","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","pdfPath":"/iel7/42/7051305/06985637.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sparse-View Spectral CT Reconstruction Using Spectral Patch-Based Low-Rank Penalty","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6985637/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Sparse-View Spectral CT Reconstruction Using Spectral Patch-Based Low-Rank Penalty","volume":"34","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/6985637/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"14948563","pubMedId":"25532170","publicationDate":"March 2015","dateOfInsertion":"27 February 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 December 2014","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004084","fundingName":"Korea Science and Engineering Foundation","grantNumber":"NRF-2009-0081089"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000002","fundingName":"National Institutes of Health","grantNumber":"R01EB013293"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sparse-View Spectral CT Reconstruction Using Spectral Patch-Based Low-Rank Penalty","sourcePdf":"tmi-li-2380993-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.100725S","chronDate":"March  2015","xplore-pub-id":"42","isNumber":"7051305","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"42","citationCount":"85","xplore-issue":"7051305","articleId":"6985637","onlineDate":"18 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":6985642,"authors":[{"name":"Sajal K.

In general, high-precision manipulation is usually achieved by the guidance of high-precision sensors; however, sensorless methods, for some special cases, are more reliable and effective. There are many important works in this aspect [1]-[3]. The concept of \u201cattractive region in environment\u201d (ARIE), which was proposed in our previous works [4]-[6], provides a prospective approach for low-precision systems to achieve high-precision manipulation. It has been used in various industrial applications, such as robotic assembly [7], grasping [8], and localization [9]. ARIE is a region from any point of which the uncertainty of the system can be eliminated by a state-independent input. The utilization of attractive region can be easily understood by the case of a bean in a bowl. For a bean in a bowl, no matter where the initial position of the bean is, it will move to and finally stay at the bottom of the bowl under gravity. Thus, the uncertainty of the bean is eliminated by gravity without any sensor feedback. Inspired by the above case, the general concept of ARIE is proposed and is applied to industry. In this paper, we review the application of ARIE and give its formal definition. Furthermore, we establish conditions for the existence of ARIE in the generalized configuration space, which is complex and nonideal. The relationship between the high-dimensional attractive region and the low-dimensional one is also discussed, which is helpful to make feasible and reliable manipulation strategies in the low-dimensional configuration space. The main contribution of this paper is the generalization of the concept of ARIE, which provides a theoretical foundation for applications including the high-precision manipulation with low-precision system. The experimental simulations on different kinds of complex manipulations show the effectiveness of the proposed method for industrial applications.","doi":"10.1109/TMECH.2014.2375638","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/3516/7230311/06985645.pdf","startPage":"2311","endPage":"2327","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMECH.2014.2375638","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7230311","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Concept of \u201cAttractive Region in Environment\u201d and its Application in High-Precision Tasks With Low-Precision Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6985645","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 December 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6985645/","displayDocTitle":"The Concept of \u201cAttractive Region in Environment\u201d and its Application in High-Precision Tasks With Low-Precision Systems","volume":"20","issue":"5","publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","accessionNumber":"15415683","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6985645/","dateOfInsertion":"31 August 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation (NNSF) of China","grantNumber":"61033011 and 61210009"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"NNSF of China","grantNumber":"61303174"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"NNSF of China","grantNumber":"61105085"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Concept of \u201cAttractive Region in Environment\u201d and its Application in High-Precision Tasks With Low-Precision Systems","sourcePdf":"tmech-qiao-2375638-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.123942S","chronDate":"Oct.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"3516","isNumber":"7230311","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3516","citationCount":"71","xplore-issue":"7230311","articleId":"6985645","onlineDate":"18 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-19"},{"_id":6985653,"authors":[{"name":"Rong Pan","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"p":["Rong Pan was born in Yunnan, China, in 1988.

A periodic waveform reconstruction using incoherent undersampling remaps time indices of samples using the modulus of the suspected period of the signal, effectively folding the signal into a time window equal to one period. The major cost and accuracy limitations of the reconstruction technique arise from estimation of the waveform period. Multiple cost functions have been proposed to estimate the period, including frequency domain metrics, which are computationally intensive. In this paper, we propose a new time domain zero-crossing (ZC)-based metric, where the metric gives the number of ZC in the reconstructed waveform for an assumed period of the waveform. The reconstruction technique is also extended to beyond the track-and-hold amplifier bandwidth using a novel test setup combining the incoherent undersampling with multichannel bandwidth interleaving.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7302619","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVLSI.2014.2369007","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/92/7302619/06985654.pdf","startPage":"2357","endPage":"2370","doi":"10.1109/TVLSI.2014.2369007","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Incoherent Undersampling-Based Waveform Reconstruction Using a Time-Domain Zero-Crossing Metric","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2015","displayDocTitle":"Incoherent Undersampling-Based Waveform Reconstruction Using a Time-Domain Zero-Crossing Metric","volume":"23","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/6985654/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2015","accessionNumber":"15553526","dateOfInsertion":"26 October 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6985654/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 December 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000028","fundingName":"Semiconductor research corp.","grantNumber":"1836.072"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Incoherent Undersampling-Based Waveform Reconstruction Using a Time-Domain Zero-Crossing Metric","sourcePdf":"tvlsi-bhatta-2369007-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.067922S","chronDate":"Nov.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"7302619","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7302619","articleId":"6985654","onlineDate":"18 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6985655,"authors":[{"name":"Liuxi Qian","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Texas at Dallas, Richardson, TX, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/92/7302619/6985655/qian-2377013-small.gif","p":["Liuxi Qian received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electronic engineering from the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China, in 2006 and 2009, respectively.

However, it is only restricted to be used in block-level due to the complexity of current mixed-signal system. This paper presents a hierarchical methodology for efficiently migrating mixed-signal circuit design from one technology node to another, while keeping the same circuit and layout topologies. It utilizes two stages of optimization processes to automatically resize and refine device dimensions in target technology. In the first stage, to avoid the costly simulation time without scarifying systematical functionality, only one block is represented in transistor level (TL), while other blocks are replaced with behavioral models. The multistart global optimization technique is applied to resize the TL block in systematic connection. This stage provides a good initial point for next system-level refinement. Moreover, for obtaining a process and parasitic closure solution, both parasitic and process variation effects are explored and used to constrain the schematic migration. A representative mixed-signal system, charge-pump phase-locked loop, is used to validate the proposed methodology. The experimental results show that the proposed methodology efficiently generates quality designs in target technology with much less simulation iterations, when comparing with recent available approaches.","doi":"10.1109/TVLSI.2014.2377013","startPage":"2595","endPage":"2605","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/92/7302619/06985655.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVLSI.2014.2377013","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7302619","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Automated Technology Migration Methodology for Mixed-Signal Circuit Based on Multistart Optimization Framework","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Mathematical model","Optimization","Voltage-controlled oscillators","Integrated circuit modeling","Phase frequency detector","Equations","Hardware design languages"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["charge pump circuits","mixed analogue-digital integrated circuits","optimisation","phase locked loops"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automated technology migration methodology","mixed-signal circuit","multistart optimization framework","optimization-simulation loop-based method","migration automation","reuse automation","current mixed-signal system","device dimension","transistor level","behavioral model","multistart global optimization technique","TL block","system-level refinement","parasitic closure solution","process variation effect","schematic migration","charge-pump phase-locked loop"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Design reuse","optimization method","phase-locked loop (PLL)","technology migration"]},{"kwd":["Design reuse","optimization method","phase-locked loop (PLL)","technology migration"]}],"chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/92/7302619/6985655-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6985655/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 December 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2015","displayDocTitle":"Automated Technology Migration Methodology for Mixed-Signal Circuit Based on Multistart Optimization Framework","volume":"23","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/6985655/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"26 October 2015","accessionNumber":"15553547","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"1115556"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000028","fundingName":"Semiconductor Research Corporation","grantNumber":"525870 and 637163"},{"fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China through the Research Project","grantNumber":"61125401, 61376040 and 6122840"},{"fundingName":"National Basic Research Program of China","grantNumber":"2011CB309701"},{"fundingName":"National Major Science and Technology Special","grantNumber":"2014ZX02301001-005-002"},{"fundingName":"Shanghai Science and Technology Committee","grantNumber":"13XD1401100"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Automated Technology Migration Methodology for Mixed-Signal Circuit Based on Multistart Optimization Framework","sourcePdf":"tvlsi-qian-2377013-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.0828S","chronDate":"Nov.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"7302619","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"7302619","articleId":"6985655","onlineDate":"18 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":6985659,"authors":[{"name":"Jingang Bai","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/7109198/6985659/bai-2381159-small.gif","p":["\nJingang Bai received the B.Sc. degree in \nelectrical engineering from Harbin University of Science and Technology, Harbin, China, in 2009 and the M.Sc. degree \nfrom Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, in 2011, where he is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree.","He is the author or coauthor of 35 published technical papers.

Compared with traditional double-rotor machines (DRMs), the MFM-BDRM shows more complicated electromechanical energy conversion relations, due to its special operating principle-the magnetic field modulation principle. To analyze the speed relation in the MFM-BDRM, a diagrammatized method is proposed. It shows that the speeds of stator magnetic field, modulating ring rotor, and PM rotor present a collinear speed characteristic. On this basis, the torque relations of stator, modulating ring rotor, and PM rotor are investigated from the view of a conservative lossless system. Then, a lever-balanced torque map is proposed to analyze their torque characteristic. It shows that the torques of stator, modulating ring rotor, and PM rotor can be calculated by the lever balance principle. The power flow map is further proposed to analyze the power flow characteristic among three ports. In addition, comparison of the MFM-BDRM and the planetary gear shows that the MFM-BDRM can be totally equivalent to an electrical machine and a planetary gear, making it gain a great advantage particularly when the MFM-BDRM is used in HEVs. The electromagnetic performance of MFM-BDRM is investigated by a finite-element method, which shows that the MFM-BDRM has advantages of fine sinusoidal back electromotive force and low torque fluctuation. Finally, the speed and torque analysis and FE results are verified by experiment.","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2014.2381159","startPage":"4023","endPage":"4033","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on

provides a feasible way by enhancing the writing capability and reducing the media switching field for achieving ultrahigh areal density of magnetic storage. However, the media switching field is dependent on the angle between the easy axis and the applied field. The adjacent track encroachment induced by this angular disturbance may happen, which could increase recording noise and lead to measurable erasure. This problem is highlighted in SMR system because of the enlarged stray field. A trapezoidal shingled writing head is modeled to explore the spatial field distribution and how the writing performance is affected by the angular dependence of media coercivity. The results show that a larger easy axis deviation and a smaller anisotropy energy density ratio of hard region will be helpful for reducing switching field to improve writing capability. The analysis also suggests that, if properly arranged, the adjacent bits can suffer minimized encroachment caused by variation of angularly induced switching field and attain a satisfactory bit error rate of as low as <;5\u00d710\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">-4</sup>\n.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel7/20/7112250/06985660.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Angular Dependence of Coercivity and Bit Error Rate Estimation for Shingled Magnetic Recording With ECC Media","doi":"10.1109/TMAG.2014.2381164","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7112250","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMAG.2014.2381164","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6985660","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6985660/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 December 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2015","displayDocTitle":"Angular Dependence of Coercivity and Bit Error Rate Estimation for Shingled Magnetic Recording With ECC Media","dateOfInsertion":"22 May 2015","externalId":"3000704","publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15143836","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"51","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/6985660/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Angular Dependence of Coercivity and Bit Error Rate Estimation for Shingled Magnetic Recording With ECC Media","sourcePdf":"tmag-chen-2381164-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.104301S","chronDate":"May  2015","xplore-pub-id":"20","isNumber":"7112250","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7112250","articleId":"6985660","onlineDate":"18 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6985665,"authors":[{"name":"Chadi Abou-Rjeily","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Lebanese American University (LAU), Byblos, Lebanon"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/7081396/6985665/abour-2381264-small.gif","p":["\nChadi Abou-Rjeily received the B.E. degree in electrical engineering \nfrom the Lebanese University, Roumieh, Lebanon, in 2002, the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering in 2003 \nand 2006, respectively, from the \u00c9cole Nationale Sup\u00e9rieure des T\u00e9l\u00e9communications (ENST), \nParis, France.

In particular, we propose two novel distributed space-time block codes (STBCs) suitable for the amplify-and-forward (AF) cooperation protocol with one and two relays. Despite the fact that FD relaying results in significant levels of interference between the transmit and receive antennas of each relay, it introduces new concepts to the problem of distributed STBC design. Compared to half-duplex (HD) STBC, FD-STBC is subject to an additional constraint that imposes the structure of the codewords while it offers the predominant advantage that resides in the possibility of including a smaller number of information symbols per codeword for achieving a full rate. We take advantage of this potential for constructing fully-diverse, full-rate and totally-real IR-UWB FD-STBCs that outperform the existing HD-STBCs for all practical levels of the residual self loop interference. In fact, for the sake of transmitting at full rate, the best known distributed HD-STBCs for the non-orthogonal AF protocol require the joint encoding/decoding of $4N_{r}$ symbols where $N_{r} $ is the number of relays. On the other hand, the proposed FD-STBCs require embedding only $N_{r} +2$ symbols per codeword for transmitting at full rate. Following from this fact, not only the decoding complexity is reduced, but also the coding gains are improved resulting in enhanced performance levels.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2014.2381264","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2014.2381264","startPage":"2144","endPage":"2155","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/7081396/06985665.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7081396","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed Space-Time Codes for Full-Duplex IR-UWB Amplify-and-Forward Cooperation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 December 2014","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2015","displayDocTitle":"Distributed Space-Time Codes for Full-Duplex IR-UWB Amplify-and-Forward Cooperation","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2015","dateOfInsertion":"07 April 2015","volume":"14","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6985665/","accessionNumber":"15039122","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6985665/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed Space-Time Codes for Full-Duplex IR-UWB Amplify-and-Forward Cooperation","sourcePdf":"twc-abourjeily-2381264-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.105189S","chronDate":"April  2015","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"7081396","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7081396","articleId":"6985665","onlineDate":"18 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6985666,"authors":[{"name":"Xue Lin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Southern California, CA, Los Angeles"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4629386/7080963/6985666/lin-small.gif","p":["Xue Lin (S\u201912) received the BS degree from Tsinghua University,\n Beijing, China, in 2009.

Applications running on mobile devices may be represented by task graphs. This work investigates the problem of scheduling tasks (which belong to the same or possibly different applications) in the MCC environment. More precisely, the scheduling problem involves the following steps: (i) determining the tasks to be offloaded onto the cloud, (ii) mapping the remaining tasks onto (potentially heterogeneous) local cores in the mobile device, (iii) determining the frequencies for executing local tasks, and (iv) scheduling tasks on the cores (for in-house tasks) and the wireless communication channels (for offloaded tasks) such that the task-precedence requirements and the application completion time constraint are satisfied while the total energy dissipation in the mobile device is minimized. A novel algorithm is presented, which starts from a minimal-delay scheduling solution and subsequently performs energy reduction by migrating tasks among the local cores and the cloud and by applying the dynamic voltage and frequency scaling technique. A linear-time rescheduling algorithm is proposed for the task migration. Simulation results demonstrate significant energy reduction with the application completion time constraint satisfied.","doi":"10.1109/TSC.2014.2381227","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSC.2014.2381227","startPage":"175","endPage":"186","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Services Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Services Computing","pdfPath":"/iel7/4629386/7080963/06985666.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7080963","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Task Scheduling with Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling for Energy Minimization in the Mobile Cloud Computing Environment","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6985666/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March-April 1 2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 December 2014","displayDocTitle":"Task Scheduling with Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling for Energy Minimization in the Mobile Cloud Computing Environment","volume":"8","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"11 April 2019","accessionNumber":"15036073","publicationDate":"1 March-April 2015","htmlLink":"/document/6985666/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Software and Hardware Foundations"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Task Scheduling with Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling for Energy Minimization in the Mobile Cloud Computing Environment","sourcePdf":"tsc-lin-2381227-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.117125S","chronDate":"March-April 1 2015","xplore-pub-id":"4629386","isNumber":"7080963","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4629386","citationCount":"132","xplore-issue":"7080963","articleId":"6985666","onlineDate":"18 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6985667,"authors":[{"name":"F.

Its main advantage over similar two-terminal algorithms lies in the fact it does not require the data from both line terminals to be synchronized. In order to do so, the algorithm is applied in real time, and a communication system is used, whose data-transmission latency is taken into account in the proposed formulation. The fault locator routines were implemented using the real-time digital simulator (RTDS), such that a wide variety of fault scenarios in a 230-kV transmission line 200 km long was evaluated in real time, considering communication systems with different latency variability levels. The obtained results indicate the proposed algorithm is able to locate faults using either synchronized or unsynchronized two-terminal data, whereas classical methods work properly for synchronized measurements only.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fault location","Data communication","Real-time systems","Transient analysis","Synchronization","Transmission line measurements","Power systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fault location","power transmission lines","real-time systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["two-terminal traveling-wave-based fault-location algorithm","line terminals","data-transmission latency","fault locator routines","real-time digital simulator","RTDS","transmission line","communication systems","latency variability levels","unsynchronized two-terminal data","voltage 230 kV","distance 200 km"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Fault location","power systems","transmission lines","traveling-wave-based fault locators","unsynchronized data"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TPWRD.2014.2380774","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","pdfPath":"/iel7/61/7110680/06985667.pdf","startPage":"1067","endPage":"1076","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7110680","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRD.2014.2380774","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Real-Time Traveling-Wave-Based Fault Location Using Two-Terminal Unsynchronized Data","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6985667","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Real-Time Traveling-Wave-Based Fault Location Using Two-Terminal Unsynchronized Data","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6985667/","volume":"30","issue":"3","publicationDate":"June 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6985667/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"15143199","dateOfInsertion":"20 May 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 December 2014","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Real-Time Traveling-Wave-Based Fault Location Using Two-Terminal Unsynchronized Data","sourcePdf":"tpwrd-lopes-2380774-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.076366S","chronDate":"June  2015","xplore-pub-id":"61","isNumber":"7110680","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"61","citationCount":"67","xplore-issue":"7110680","articleId":"6985667","onlineDate":"18 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-31"},{"_id":6985671,"authors":[{"name":"Ke Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Northeastern University, Boston, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Ke","lastName":"Chen","id":"37085354525"},{"name":"Jie Han","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada"],"firstName":"Jie","lastName":"Han","id":"37556260600"},{"name":"Fabrizio Lombardi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Northeastern University, Boston, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Fabrizio","lastName":"Lombardi","id":"37279999000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-8210"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9999"}],"articleNumber":"6985671","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":631},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Solid-State Circuits Society","url":"http://www.sscs.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Magnetic tunneling","Random access memory","Nonvolatile memory","Delays","Resistance","MOSFET"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["delay circuits","magnetic tunnelling","SRAM chips"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["restore operation","MTJ-based nonvolatile SRAM cell","nonvolatile static random access memory cell","NVSRAM circuitry","magnetic tunneling junction","bitline","figures of merit","operational delay","static noise margin","power consumption","critical charge","process variation","read delay","restore delay"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Instant-ON","magnetic tunneling junction (MTJ)","nonvolatile memory","static random access memory (SRAM)."]},{"kwd":["Instant-ON","magnetic tunneling junction (MTJ)","nonvolatile memory","static random access memory (SRAM)"]}],"abstract":"This brief investigates the Restore mechanism of a nonvolatile static random access memory (NVSRAM) cell that utilizes two magnetic tunneling junctions (MTJs) as nonvolatile resistive elements and a 6T SRAM core.

The proposed cells use the bitline and supply as mechanisms to initiate the Restore operation, so connecting the two MTJs to different nodes of the NVSRAM circuitry.

Different from conventionally cognitive radio network, where spectrum sensing and signal transmission are performed separately, the proposed framework integrates spectrum sensing into signal transmission by assigning different signal types to primary user and cognitive users, i.e., sinusoidal signal and chirp signals for primary user and cognitive users, respectively. Thanks to the energy concentration property of chirp signals in the fractional Fourier transform (FrFT) domain, the separation of primary user and cognitive users can be realized easily. In this proposed framework, interference to primary user can be reduced because of the simplified time slot structure, and channel capacity can also be improved by removing the separate spectrum sensing process. Moreover, by using the energy accumulation of the primary user in the signal transmission process, the detection probability of the proposed framework can also be improved even with channel estimation error and signal separation error.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCOMM.2014.2381216","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7033064","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/4234/7033064/06985717.pdf","endPage":"242","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Relay-Based Cooperative Spectrum Sensing Framework Under Imperfect Channel Estimation","doi":"10.1109/LCOMM.2014.2381216","startPage":"239","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6985717","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 December 2014","displayDocTitle":"Relay-Based Cooperative Spectrum Sensing Framework Under Imperfect Channel Estimation","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6985717/","dateOfInsertion":"06 February 2015","accessionNumber":"14914562","publicationDate":"Feb. 2015","htmlLink":"/document/6985717/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"19","issue":"2","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Basic Research Program of China","grantNumber":"2013CB329003"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61301100"},{"fundingName":"Heilongjiang Postdoctoral Science-Research Foundation","grantNumber":"LBH-Q12081"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Relay-Based Cooperative Spectrum Sensing Framework Under Imperfect Channel Estimation","sourcePdf":"lcomm-wu-2381216-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047029S","chronDate":"Feb.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"4234","isNumber":"7033064","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4234","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7033064","articleId":"6985717","onlineDate":"18 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6985718,"authors":[{"name":"\u00d6zg\u00fcr Y\u00fcr\u00fcr","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of South Florida, Tampa, FL, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/9739/7393921/6985718/yurur-2381246-small.gif","p":["\n\u00d6zg\u00fcr Y\u00fcr\u00fcr (M'13) received a double major from \nGebze Institute of Technology, Kocaeli, Turkey, in 2008 and the M.S.E.E. and Ph.D. degrees from the University of South \nFlorida, Tampa, FL, USA, in 2010 and 2013, respectively.

The existence and awareness of the context provide the capability of being conscious of physical environments or situations around mobile device users. This allows network services to respond proactively and intelligently based on such awareness. The key idea behind context-aware applications is to encourage users to collect, analyze, and share local sensory knowledge in the purpose for a large-scale community use by creating a smart network. The desired network is capable of making autonomous logical decisions to actuate environmental objects and also assist individuals. However, many open challenges remain, which are mostly arisen because the middleware services provided in mobile devices have limited resources in terms of power, memory, and bandwidth. Thus, it becomes critically important to study how the drawbacks can be elaborated and resolved and, at the same time, better understand the opportunities for the research community to contribute to the context-awareness. To this end, this paper surveys the literature over the period of 1991-2014 from the emerging concepts to applications of context-awareness in mobile platforms by providing up-to-date research and future research directions. Moreover, it points out the challenges faced in this regard and enlightens them by proposing possible solutions.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7393921","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/COMST.2014.2381246","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials","pdfPath":"/iel7/9739/7393921/06985718.pdf","startPage":"68","endPage":"93","doi":"10.1109/COMST.2014.2381246","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Context-Awareness for Mobile Sensing: A Survey and Future Directions","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Firstquarter  2016","displayDocTitle":"Context-Awareness for Mobile Sensing: A Survey and Future Directions","volume":"18","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/6985718/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Firstquarter 2016","accessionNumber":"15730359","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6985718/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 December 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61300179"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Context-Awareness for Mobile Sensing: A Survey and Future Directions","sourcePdf":"comst-liu-2381246-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.293901S","chronDate":"Firstquarter  2016","xplore-pub-id":"9739","isNumber":"7393921","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9739","citationCount":"112","xplore-issue":"7393921","articleId":"6985718","onlineDate":"18 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6985720,"authors":[{"name":"Valerio Mariani","affiliation":["Department of Engineering, University of Sannio, Benevento, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/7109198/6985720/maria-2381151-small.gif","p":["\nValerio Mariani was born in 1979 in Florence, Italy.

In this paper, a mathematical model for islanded microgrids with linear loads and inverters under frequency and voltage droop control is proposed. The model is constructed by introducing a suitable state-space transformation that allows to write the closed-loop model in an explicit state-space form. Then, the singular perturbations technique is used to obtain reduced order models that reproduce the stability properties of the original closed-loop model. The analysis shows that the currents' dynamics influence the stability of the microgrid, particularly for high values of the frequency droop control parameters. It is also shown that a further reduction of the model order leads to a typical oscillator model that is not able to predict the possible instability of the droop-controlled system. Numerical and experimental results demonstrate the validity of the proposed models.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/41/7109198/06985720.pdf","startPage":"4344","endPage":"4354","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2014.2381151","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2014.2381151","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7109198","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6985720","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Model Order Reductions for Stability Analysis of Islanded Microgrids With Droop Control","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Inverters","Microgrids","Load modeling","Reduced order systems","Mathematical model","Stability analysis","Integrated circuit modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["closed loop systems","distributed power generation","energy resources","frequency control","invertors","linear systems","reduced order systems","singularly perturbed systems","stability","state-space methods","voltage control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["model order reductions","stability analysis","islanded microgrids","three-phase inverters","interface distributed energy resources","mathematical model","linear loads","voltage droop control","state-space transformation","closed-loop model","singular perturbations technique","reduced order models","frequency droop control parameters","typical oscillator model"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Droop control","microgrids","power systems stability"]},{"kwd":["Droop control","microgrids","power systems modeling","power systems stability"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6985720/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 December 2014","displayDocTitle":"Model Order Reductions for Stability Analysis of Islanded Microgrids With Droop Control","volume":"62","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/6985720/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2015","accessionNumber":"15142404","dateOfInsertion":"15 May 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Model Order Reductions for Stability Analysis of Islanded Microgrids With Droop Control","sourcePdf":"tie-mariani-2381151-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.102492S","chronDate":"July  2015","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"7109198","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"80","xplore-issue":"7109198","articleId":"6985720","onlineDate":"18 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6985731,"authors":[{"name":"Ying Chen","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Technology, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4629386/7123022/6985731/chen-small.gif","p":["Ying Chen received the BEng degree from School of Computer Science in\n Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China, in 2012.

Since QoS is an aggregated concept consisting of several attributes, service composition on enormous candidate sets is a challenging multi-objective optimization problem. In this paper, we study the problem from a general Pareto optimal angle, seeking to reduce search space in service composition. Pareto set model for QoS-aware service composition is introduced, and its relationship with the widely used utility function model is theoretically studied, which proves the applicability of our model. QoS attributes are systematically studied according to their different types of aggregation patterns in service composition, and QoS-based dominance relationships between candidates and between workflows are defined. Taking advantage of pruning candidates by dominance relationships and constraint validations at candidate level, a service composition algorithm using partial selection techniques is proposed. Furthermore, a parallel approach is designed, which is able to significantly reduce search space and achieve great performance gains. A careful analysis of the optimality of our approach is provided, and its efficacy is further validated by both simulation experiments and real-world data based evaluations.","doi":"10.1109/TSC.2014.2381493","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Services Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Services Computing","pdfPath":"/iel7/4629386/7123022/06985731.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSC.2014.2381493","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7123022","startPage":"384","endPage":"397","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Partial Selection Methodology for Efficient QoS-Aware Service Composition","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6985731","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Partial Selection Methodology for Efficient QoS-Aware Service Composition","chronOrPublicationDate":"May-June 1 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6985731/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 December 2014","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"8","issue":"3","publicationDate":"1 May-June 2015","accessionNumber":"15201128","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","htmlLink":"/document/6985731/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61020106002"},{"fundingName":"Tsinghua University Initiative Scientific Research Program","grantNumber":"20121087999"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Partial Selection Methodology for Efficient QoS-Aware Service Composition","sourcePdf":"tsc-chen-2381493-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.114324S","chronDate":"May-June 1 2015","xplore-pub-id":"4629386","isNumber":"7123022","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4629386","citationCount":"59","xplore-issue":"7123022","articleId":"6985731","onlineDate":"18 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6985736,"authors":[{"name":"Su Hu","affiliation":["University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, National Key Laboratory on Communications, Chengdu, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/6985733/6985736/6985736-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Su HU received his M.S. and Ph.D degree in the National Key Lab on Communciations from University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC) in 2007 and 2010, respectively.

However, traditional ZCZ sequences (which assume the availability of the entire spectral band) cannot be used because their orthogonality will be destroyed by the spectrum hole constraint in a CR channel. To date, analytical construction of ZCZ CR sequences remains open. Taking advantage of the Kronecker sequence property, a novel family of sequences (called \"quasi-ZCZ\" CR sequences) which displays zero cross-correlation and near-zero auto-correlation zone property under arbitrary spectrum hole constraint is presented in this paper. Furthermore, a novel algorithm is proposed to jointly optimize the peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) and the periodic auto-correlations of the proposed quasi-ZCZ CR sequences. Simulations show that they give rise to single-user bit-error-rate performance in CR-CDMA systems which outperform traditional non-contiguous multicarrier CDMA and transform domain communication systems; they also lead to CR-CDMA systems which are more resilient than non-contiguous OFDM systems to spectrum sensing mismatch, due to the wideband spreading.","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2014.141103","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2014.141103","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/49/6985733/06985736.pdf","startPage":"1974","endPage":"1986","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6985733","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sequence Design for Cognitive CDMA Communications under Arbitrary Spectrum Hole Constraint","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6985736/","chronOrPublicationDate":"November  2014","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 December 2014","displayDocTitle":"Sequence Design for Cognitive CDMA Communications under Arbitrary Spectrum Hole Constraint","volume":"32","issue":"11","dateOfInsertion":"18 December 2014","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"November 2014","accessionNumber":"14811256","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6985736/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sequence Design for Cognitive CDMA Communications under Arbitrary Spectrum Hole Constraint","sourcePdf":"1974jsac0914hu.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.093327S","chronDate":"November  2014","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"6985733","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"6985733","articleId":"6985736","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6985737,"authors":[{"name":"Panayotis Mertikopoulos","affiliation":["French National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS), Laboratoire d'Informatique de Grenoble, Grenoble, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/6985733/6985737/6985737-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Panayotis Mertikopoulos received the B.S. degree in physics with a major in astrophysics from the University of Athens in 2003.

To combine the advantages of orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) and multiple-input, multiple-output (MIMO) technologies, we consider a MIMO-OFDM cognitive radio network where wireless users with multiple antennas communicate over several non-interfering frequency bands. As the network's primary users (PUs) come and go in the system, the communication environment changes constantly (and, in many cases, randomly). Accordingly, the network's unlicensed, secondary users (SUs) must adapt their transmit profiles \"on the fly\" in order to maximize their data rate in a rapidly evolving environment over which they have no control. In this dynamic setting, static solution concepts (such as Nash equilibrium) are no longer relevant, so we focus on dynamic transmit policies that lead to no regret: specifically, we consider policies that perform at least as well as (and typically outperform) even the best fixed transmit profile in hindsight. Drawing on the method of matrix exponential learning and online mirror descent techniques, we derive a no-regret transmit policy for the system's SUs which relies only on local channel state information (CSI). Using this method, the system's SUs are able to track their individually evolving optimum transmit profiles remarkably well, even under rapidly (and randomly) changing conditions. Importantly, the proposed augmented exponential learning (AXL) policy leads to no regret even if the SUs' channel measurements are subject to arbitrarily large observation errors (the imperfect CSI case), thus ensuring the method's robustness in the presence of uncertainties.","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2014.141104","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/49/6985733/06985737.pdf","startPage":"1987","endPage":"1999","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2014.141104","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6985733","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Transmit without Regrets: Online Optimization in MIMO-OFDM Cognitive Radio Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6985737","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 December 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"November  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6985737/","displayDocTitle":"Transmit without Regrets: Online Optimization in MIMO-OFDM Cognitive Radio Systems","volume":"32","issue":"11","publicationDate":"November 2014","accessionNumber":"14811247","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6985737/","dateOfInsertion":"18 December 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Transmit without Regrets: Online Optimization in MIMO-OFDM Cognitive Radio Systems","sourcePdf":"1987jsac1114mertiko.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.13845S","chronDate":"November  2014","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"6985733","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"6985733","articleId":"6985737","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6985738,"authors":[{"name":"Yasin Yilmaz","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/6985733/6985738/6985738-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yasin Yilmaz (S\u2018 11) received the B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees in electrical engineering from Middle East Technical University, Ankara, Turkey in 2008, and Koc University, Istanbul, Turkey in 2010, respectively.

With the goal of maximizing the secondary user (SU) throughput subject to constraints on the primary user (PU) outage probability we formulate a joint problem of spectrum sensing and channel state estimation. The problem is cast into a sequential framework since sensing time minimization is crucial for throughput maximization. In the optimum solution, the sensing decision rule is coupled with the channel estimator, making the separate treatment of the sensing and channel estimation strictly suboptimal. Using such a joint structure for spectrum sensing and channel estimation we propose a distributed (cooperative) dynamic spectrum access scheme under statistical channel state information (CSI). In the proposed scheme, the SUs report their sufficient statistics to a fusion center (FC) via level-triggered sampling, a nonuniform sampling technique that is known to be bandwidth-and-energy efficient. Then, the FC makes a sequential spectrum sensing decision using local statistics and channel estimates, and selects the SU with the best transmission opportunity. The selected SU, using the sensing decision and its channel estimates, computes the transmit power and starts data transmission. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme significantly outperforms its conventional counterparts, under the same PU outage constraints, in terms of the achievable SU throughput.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"November  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6985738/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 December 2014","volume":"32","issue":"11","accessionNumber":"14811250","publicationDate":"November 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6985738/","dateOfInsertion":"18 December 2014","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Sequential Joint Spectrum Sensing and Channel Estimation for Dynamic Spectrum Access","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sequential Joint Spectrum Sensing and Channel Estimation for Dynamic Spectrum Access","sourcePdf":"2000jsac1114yilmaz.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.084325S","chronDate":"November  2014","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"6985733","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"6985733","articleId":"6985738","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6985739,"authors":[{"name":"Gongzheng Zhang","affiliation":["Institute of Information and Communication Engineering, The Zhejiang Provincial Key Laboratory of Information Network Technology, Hangzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/6985733/6985739/6985739-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Gongzheng Zhang (S'13) received the B.Sc. degree in communication engineering from Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China, in 2010.

To address both issues, we propose a two-phase channel access scheme, which consists of a distributed channel negotiation phase and a hopping-based channel access phase for each SU. Specifically, in its first phase, an SU attempts to negotiate a specific initial slot/channel differing from the ones chosen by other SUs. Then, in its second phase, the SU chooses a channel in each time slot in a hopping-based manner to transmit data, where the hopping starts from its initial channel and follows a common hopping sequence. Virtual channels are introduced to accommodate the situation when the number of SUs is larger than that of actual channels. The average maximal waiting time due to the channel negotiation phase is derived, and the effective capacity of the service process for each SU in the channel access phase is analyzed. Numerical results show that the proposed scheme can support a higher traffic load under the statistical delay constraint, as compared with fixed or random channel access schemes.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/49/6985733/06985739.pdf","startPage":"2026","endPage":"2038","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2014.141107","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2014.141107","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6985733","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6985739","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design and Analysis of Distributed Hopping-Based Channel Access in Multi-Channel Cognitive Radio Systems with Delay Constraints","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Delays","Sensors","Cognitive radio","Markov processes","Telecommunication traffic","Correlation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","telecommunication traffic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed hopping-based channel access","multichannel cognitive radio systems","delay-sensitive traffic","channel access scheme","primary users","transmission collisions","secondary users","distributed channel negotiation phase","hopping-based channel access phase"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cognitive radio system","channel negotiation","hopping-based channel access","statistical delay constraint","effective capacity"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6985739/","chronOrPublicationDate":"November  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 December 2014","displayDocTitle":"Design and Analysis of Distributed Hopping-Based Channel Access in Multi-Channel Cognitive Radio Systems with Delay Constraints","volume":"32","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/6985739/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"November 2014","accessionNumber":"14811237","dateOfInsertion":"18 December 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design and Analysis of Distributed Hopping-Based Channel Access in Multi-Channel Cognitive Radio Systems with Delay Constraints","sourcePdf":"2026jsac1114zhang2.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.107952S","chronDate":"November  2014","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"6985733","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"6985733","articleId":"6985739","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6985740,"authors":[{"name":"Dinh Thai Hoang","affiliation":["Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, Singapore, SG"],"firstName":"Dinh Thai","lastName":"Hoang"},{"name":"Dusit Niyato","affiliation":["Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, Singapore, SG"],"firstName":"Dusit","lastName":"Niyato"},{"name":"Ping Wang","affiliation":["Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, Singapore, SG"],"firstName":"Ping","lastName":"Wang"},{"name":"Dong In Kim","affiliation":["Sungkyunkwan University, Jongno-gu, Seoul, KR"],"firstName":"Dong In","lastName":"Kim"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0733-8716"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0008"}],"articleNumber":"6985740","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":64,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1450},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6985740","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radio frequency","Energy harvesting","Optimization","Energy states","Cognitive radio","Throughput","Sensors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","energy harvesting"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["opportunistic channel access","RF energy harvesting","cognitive radio networks","radio frequency energy harvesting","wireless networks","secondary user","packet transmission"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["RF energy harvesting","cognitive radio","Markov decision process"]}],"doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2014.141108","endPage":"2052","startPage":"2039","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/49/6985733/06985740.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2014.141108","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6985733","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Opportunistic Channel Access and RF Energy Harvesting in Cognitive Radio Networks","abstract":"Radio frequency (RF) energy harvesting is a promising technique to sustain operations of wireless networks. In a cognitive radio network, a secondary user can be equipped with RF energy harvesting capability. In this paper, we consider such a network where the secondary user can perform channel access to transmit a packet or to harvest RF energy when the selected channel is idle or occupied by the primary user, respectively. We present an optimization formulation to obtain the channel access policy for the secondary user to maximize its throughput. Both the case that the secondary user knows the current state of the channels and the case that the secondary knows the idle channel probabilities of channels in advance are considered. However, the optimization requires model parameters (e.g., the probability of successful packet transmission, the probability of successful RF energy harvesting, and the probability of channel to be idle) to obtain the policy. To obviate such a requirement, we apply an online learning algorithm that can observe the environment and adapt the channel access action accordingly without any a prior knowledge about the model parameters. We evaluate both the efficiency and convergence of the learning algorithm. The numerical results show that the policy obtained from the learning algorithm can achieve the performance in terms of throughput close to that obtained from the optimization.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 December 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"November  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6985740/","volume":"32","issue":"11","accessionNumber":"14811251","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"November 2014","dateOfInsertion":"18 December 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Opportunistic Channel Access and RF Energy Harvesting in Cognitive Radio Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Opportunistic Channel Access and RF Energy Harvesting in Cognitive Radio Networks","sourcePdf":"2039jsac1114hoang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.068723S","chronDate":"November  2014","isNumber":"6985733","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"64","articleId":"6985740","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6985741,"authors":[{"name":"Ning Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, 200 University Avenue West, Waterloo, ON, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/6985733/6985741/6985741-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ning Zhang (S'12) received the B.

The two fundamental issues in DSA, spectrum sensing and spectrum sharing, for a general scenario are revisited, where the channels present different usage characteristics and the detection performance of individual secondary users (SUs) varies. First, spectrum sensing is investigated, where multiple SUs are coordinated to cooperatively sense the channels owned by the primary users (PUs) for different interests. When the PUs' interests are concerned, cooperative spectrum sensing is performed to better protect the PUs while satisfying the SUs' requirement on the expected access time. For the SUs' interests, the objective is to maximize the expected available time while keeping the interference to PUs under a predefined level. With the dynamics in the channel usage characteristics and the detection capacities, the coordination problems for the above two cases are formulated as nonlinear integer programming problems accordingly, which are proved to be NP-complete. To find the solution efficiently, for the former case, the original problem is transformed into a variant of convex bipartite matching problem by constructing a complete bipartite graph and defining proper weight vectors. Based on the problem transformation, a channel selection algorithm is proposed to compute the solution. For the latter case, the deterministic optimization problem is first transformed to an associated stochastic optimization problem, which is then solved by cross-entropy (CE) method of stochastic optimization. Then, the sharing of the available channels by SUs after sensing is modeled by a channel access game, based on the framework of weighted congestion game. An algorithm for SUs to select access channels to achieve Nash equilibrium (NE) is proposed. Simulation results are presented to validate the performance of the proposed algorithms.","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2014.141109","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6985733","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2014.141109","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/49/6985733/06985741.pdf","startPage":"2053","endPage":"2064","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamic Spectrum Access in Multi-Channel Cognitive Radio Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 December 2014","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic Spectrum Access in Multi-Channel Cognitive Radio Networks","volume":"32","issue":"11","chronOrPublicationDate":"November  2014","dateOfInsertion":"18 December 2014","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6985741/","publicationDate":"November 2014","accessionNumber":"14811249","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6985741/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic Spectrum Access in Multi-Channel Cognitive Radio Networks","sourcePdf":"2053jsac1114zhang3.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.118151S","chronDate":"November  2014","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"6985733","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"92","xplore-issue":"6985733","articleId":"6985741","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6985742,"authors":[{"name":"Nader Mokari","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Tarbiat Modares University, Tehran, Iran"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/6985733/6985742/6985742-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Nader Mokari is a PhD student at Tarbiat Modares University, Tehran, Iran.

In previously proposed ERA schemes, both in conventional and heterogeneous networks, the optimal solution is obtained assuming that average of constraints are satisfied. In a heterogeneous network, this is translated into the fact that instantaneous level of interference on macro users can not be guaranteed, i.e., there is an uncontrolled probability of collision which is not acceptable by macro network. In this paper, we reformulate the ERA problem by replacing the average based constraints, in our case, femto total power constraint and macro interference threshold constraint, with their probabilistic counterparts so that both constraints are satisfied instantaneously with any desired high probability. We consider both cases of continuous and quantized channel state information. The proposed problems are then solved based on three methods, namely, iterative, analytical, and hybrid approaches. The optimality of the proposed methods is also assessed and the iterative approach is shown to have a performance quite close to that of the optimal solution. Simulation results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed scheme to provide a robust instantaneous imposed interference on macro network and a robust femto total transmit power. We also investigate the convergence properties of the proposed iterative approach.","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2014.141112","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/49/6985733/06985742.pdf","startPage":"2090","endPage":"2104","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2014.141112","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6985733","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Quantized Ergodic Radio Resource Allocation in Cognitive Femto Networks with Controlled Collision and Power Outage Probabilities","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6985742","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 December 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"November  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6985742/","displayDocTitle":"Quantized Ergodic Radio Resource Allocation in Cognitive Femto Networks with Controlled Collision and Power Outage Probabilities","volume":"32","issue":"11","publicationDate":"November 2014","accessionNumber":"14811255","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6985742/","dateOfInsertion":"18 December 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Quantized Ergodic Radio Resource Allocation in Cognitive Femto Networks with Controlled Collision and Power Outage Probabilities","sourcePdf":"2090jsac1114mokari.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.177947S","chronDate":"November  2014","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"6985733","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"6985733","articleId":"6985742","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6985743,"authors":[{"name":"Yan Long","affiliation":["Xidian University, State Key Laboratory of Integrated Services Networks, Xi'an, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/6985733/6985743/6985743-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yan Long received the BSc degree in Electrical and Information Engineering from Xidian University, China, in 2009.

For the cooperation-generated resource, existing schemes in CCRNs allocate the resource only to the relay SUs. However, this may lead to inefficient spectrum utilization, when the relay SUs have poor channel condition or little traffic load for their own secondary transmissions. In this paper, considering user diversity in secondary networks, we focus on network-level throughput optimization for secondary networks, by allowing all SUs to optimally share the cooperation-generated period. Besides, considering the energy constraint on SUs, we formulate the resource allocation problem from long-term perspective, to reflect the time-varying change of user diversity in channel condition, traffic load and energy amount. We present an online SUM scheme to solve the long-term optimization problem. Although a mixed-integer and non-convex problem is involved in the SUM scheme, we transform the problem into multiple convex subproblems, and then optimally solve it with low computational complexity. Extensive simulations show that the proposed SUM scheme significantly outperforms the existing schemes.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2014.141113","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6985733","startPage":"2105","endPage":"2116","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/49/6985733/06985743.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"SUM: Spectrum Utilization Maximization in Energy-Constrained Cooperative Cognitive Radio Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6985743/","chronOrPublicationDate":"November  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 December 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6985743/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"SUM: Spectrum Utilization Maximization in Energy-Constrained Cooperative Cognitive Radio Networks","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"November 2014","accessionNumber":"14811257","dateOfInsertion":"18 December 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"32","issue":"11","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SUM: Spectrum Utilization Maximization in Energy-Constrained Cooperative Cognitive Radio Networks","sourcePdf":"2105jsac1114long.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.115503S","chronDate":"November  2014","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"6985733","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"6985733","articleId":"6985743","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6985744,"authors":[{"name":"Yeqing Wu","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Alabama, Tuscaloosa, AL, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/6985733/6985744/6985744-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yeqing Wu received his M.S. degree from the Department of Electronic Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China, in 2008 and B.

In this paper, we propose a learning-based and QoE-driven spectrum handoff scheme to maximize the multimedia users' satisfaction. We develop a mixed preemptive and non-preemptive resume priority (PRP/NPRP) M/G/1 queueing model for modeling the spectrum usage behavior for prioritized multimedia applications. Then, a mathematical framework is formulated to analyze the performance of SUs. We apply the reinforcement learning to our QoE-driven spectrum handoff scheme to maximize the quality of video transmissions in the long term. The proposed learning scheme is asymptotically optimal, model-free, and can adaptively perform spectrum handoff for the changing channel conditions and traffic load. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed queueing model for prioritized traffic in CRNs, and show that the proposed learning-based QoE-driven spectrum handoff scheme improves quality of video transmissions.","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2014.141115","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/49/6985733/06985744.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6985733","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2014.141115","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","startPage":"2134","endPage":"2148","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Learning-Based QoE-Driven Spectrum Handoff Scheme for Multimedia Transmissions over Cognitive Radio Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6985744","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"November  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 December 2014","displayDocTitle":"A Learning-Based QoE-Driven Spectrum Handoff Scheme for Multimedia Transmissions over Cognitive Radio Networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6985744/","volume":"32","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/6985744/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"November 2014","accessionNumber":"14811245","dateOfInsertion":"18 December 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Learning-Based QoE-Driven Spectrum Handoff Scheme for Multimedia Transmissions over Cognitive Radio Networks","sourcePdf":"2134jsac1114wu.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.101428S","chronDate":"November  2014","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"6985733","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"52","xplore-issue":"6985733","articleId":"6985744","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6985745,"authors":[{"name":"Chunxiao Jiang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, P.

Meanwhile, the nationwide Super Wi-Fi project that allows the TV white space frequencies to be used for free, makes the concept of cognitive vehicular networks realistic. Recently, lots of technical issues of cognitive vehicular networks have been studied from the network designers' perspective, e.g., vehicular spectrum sensing and access, applications with different vehicular QoS, etc. Different from the existing works, in this paper, we consider from the vehicular users' perspective by optimizing throughput via route selection in cognitive vehicular networks using TV white space. By employing the attainable data rate as route selection metric, we propose two schemes: instantaneous route selection and long-term route selection. To evaluate the expected data rate on the route, we analyze the cognitive vehicular network throughput under two spectrum sharing models: spectrum overlay and spectrum underlay. In the experiments, we use Google spectrum dataset to estimate the intensity of TV base stations in the United States and evaluate the cognitive vehicular network throughput performance, which shows that the spectrum overlay model is more suitable for most of states in current United States, except New Jersey, Delaware and Utah. Moreover, we conduct a case study regarding the route I-88E and I-90E selection between Cortland and Schenectady in New York State. The traffic intensities and traffic intensity transition probabilities of these two routes are estimated using the real-world traffic volume dataset of New York State. Based on the estimated traffic information, we calculate the attainable instantaneous and long-term data rates of each vehicular user, which shows that route I-88E is preferable to route I-90E in most cases.","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2014.141116","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2014.141116","startPage":"2149","endPage":"2162","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/49/6985733/06985745.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6985733","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Data-Driven Optimal Throughput Analysis for Route Selection in Cognitive Vehicular Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 December 2014","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"November  2014","displayDocTitle":"Data-Driven Optimal Throughput Analysis for Route Selection in Cognitive Vehicular Networks","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"November 2014","dateOfInsertion":"18 December 2014","volume":"32","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6985745/","accessionNumber":"14811240","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6985745/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Data-Driven Optimal Throughput Analysis for Route Selection in Cognitive Vehicular Networks","sourcePdf":"2149jsac1114jiang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.142861S","chronDate":"November  2014","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"6985733","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"6985733","articleId":"6985745","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6985746,"authors":[{"name":"Xijun Wang","affiliation":["Science and Technology on Information Transmission and Dissemination in Communication Networks Laboratory, Shijiazhuang, China","State Key Laboratory of Integrated Service Networks, Xidian University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/6985733/6985746/6985746-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Xijun Wang (M'12) received his B.

As such, multiple SUs transmitting on the same channel will be affected when the channel is requested by the PUs, thereby resulting in a possible network partition of CRNs. Therefore, how to maintain the connectivity of CRNs considering the activity of PUs is a critical problem. In this paper, we propose a centralized and a distributed topology control algorithm respectively to address this problem. Particularly, we combine power control and channel assignment to construct a bi-channel-connected and conflict-free topology using the minimum number of channels. In the power control phase, we tailor the topology for the channel assignment in the second phase. In the channel assignment phase, we utilize the graph coloring algorithm to achieve conflict-free transmission by assigning a channel to each SU. Theoretical analysis and simulation study show that the derived topology can maintain connectivity in the event of any single channel interruption by PUs. Simulation results also demonstrate that the proposed algorithms can efficiently reduce the average number of required channels for achieving bi-channel-connectivity and conflict-free transmission and ensure that the minimum power paths in the original network preserved in the final topology.","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2014.141117","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/49/6985733/06985746.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6985733","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2014.141117","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","startPage":"2163","endPage":"2176","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Achieving Bi-Channel-Connectivity with Topology Control in Cognitive Radio Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6985746","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"November  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 December 2014","displayDocTitle":"Achieving Bi-Channel-Connectivity with Topology Control in Cognitive Radio Networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6985746/","volume":"32","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/6985746/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"November 2014","accessionNumber":"14811238","dateOfInsertion":"18 December 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Achieving Bi-Channel-Connectivity with Topology Control in Cognitive Radio Networks","sourcePdf":"2163jsac1114wang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.099248S","chronDate":"November  2014","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"6985733","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"6985733","articleId":"6985746","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6985747,"authors":[{"name":"Yulong Zou","affiliation":["Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications, School of Telecommunications and Information Engineering, Nanjing, P.R.

Considering multiple CUs available, we propose the round-robin scheduling as well as the optimal and suboptimal user scheduling schemes for improving the security of CUs-CBS transmissions against eavesdropping attacks. Specifically, the optimal user scheduling is designed by assuming that the channel state information (CSI) of all links from CUs to CBS, to primary user (PU) and to eavesdroppers are available. By contrast, the suboptimal user scheduling only requires the CSI of CUs-CBS links without the PU's and eavesdroppers' CSI. We derive closed-form expressions of the secrecy outage probability of these three scheduling schemes in the presence of {the coordinated and uncoordinated eavesdroppers}. We also carry out the secrecy diversity analysis and show that the round-robin scheduling achieves the diversity order of only one, whereas the optimal and suboptimal scheduling schemes obtain the full secrecy diversity, {no matter whether the eavesdroppers collaborate or not. In addition, numerical secrecy outage results demonstrate that for both the coordinated and uncoordinated eavesdroppers, the optimal user scheduling achieves the best security performance and the round-robin scheduling performs the worst.} Finally, upon increasing the number of CUs, the secrecy outage probabilities of the optimal and suboptimal user scheduling schemes both improve significantly.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6985747/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 December 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"November  2014","volume":"32","issue":"11","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"14811252","dateOfInsertion":"18 December 2014","publicationDate":"November 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6985747/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Secrecy Outage and Diversity Analysis of Cognitive Radio Systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Secrecy Outage and Diversity Analysis of Cognitive Radio Systems","sourcePdf":"2222jsac1114zou.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.133788S","chronDate":"November  2014","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"6985733","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"126","xplore-issue":"6985733","articleId":"6985747","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6985749,"authors":[{"name":"Stefano Rini","affiliation":["Department of Communication Engineering, National Chiao-Tung University, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/6985733/6985749/6985749-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Stefano Rini received the B.A. degree in computer science from the Politecnico di Milano, Italy, in 2005, the M.S. degree in both Electrical and Computer Engineering and Statistics from the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) in 2009.

The cognitive interference channel is a variation of the classical two-users interference channel in which one of the transmitters, the cognitive transmitter, is also provided with the message of the second transmitter, the primary transmitter. We study the capacity of the multiple-input multiple-output Gaussian model, that is the channel in which the inputs are vectors and the outputs are obtained as linear combinations of the channel inputs plus an additive complex Gaussian noise. This channel models a wireless scenario in which transmitters and receivers have multiple antennas. For this channel, we derive capacity to within an additive gap, that is we show that inner and outer bounds to capacity lie to within a constant distance of each other. The gap between the inner and outer bounds depends on the number of antennas at the cognitive receiver and both bounds can be easily evaluated by considering jointly Gaussian inputs. We also derive capacity to within a constant multiplicative factor of two, that is we show that the ratio between inner and outer bound is at most two. The additive gap well-characterizes the capacity at high SNR, while the multiplicative gap is useful at low SNR. We also derive the exact capacity for a subset of the \"strong interference\" regime: in this subset, the primary transmitter can decode the cognitive message without loss of optimality. This new capacity result extends and generalizes previously known capacity results, in particular, the capacity in the \"very strong interference\" and the \"primary decodes cognitive\" regimes.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6985749/","chronOrPublicationDate":"November  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 December 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6985749/","dateOfInsertion":"18 December 2014","publicationDate":"November 2014","accessionNumber":"14811258","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"32","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"On the Capacity of the Multiantenna Gaussian Cognitive Interference Channel","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Capacity of the Multiantenna Gaussian Cognitive Interference Channel","sourcePdf":"2252jsac1114rini.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.088841S","chronDate":"November  2014","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"6985733","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"6985733","articleId":"6985749","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6985751,"authors":[{"name":"Yuan Wu","affiliation":["Zhejiang University of Technology, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, CN"],"firstName":"Yuan","lastName":"Wu"},{"name":"Qionghua Zhu","affiliation":["Zhejiang University of Technology, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, CN"],"firstName":"Qionghua","lastName":"Zhu"},{"name":"Jianwei Huang","affiliation":["Chinese University of Hong Kong, New Territories, HK"],"firstName":"Jianwei","lastName":"Huang"},{"name":"Danny H.K.

In our scheme, based on a mutually agreed revenue sharing scheme, a primary network operator (PNO) actively shares its radio resource with a secondary network operator (SNO), which provides access service to secondary users (SUs) for its revenue maximization. To investigate the coupling effect between the revenue sharing and resource allocation, we formulate the interaction between PNO and SNO as a two-layered game, which includes a top layer game to model their revenue sharing and a bottom layer game to model their joint resource allocations. Specifically, in the top layer, based on their joint resource allocation decisions, the PNO and SNO form a Nash bargaining game to determine the revenue sharing scheme such that both of them can benefit from cooperation satisfactorily. Then, in the bottom layer, under the given revenue sharing scheme, the PNO and SNO form a Stackelberg game to determine their joint resource allocation decisions, which also influence their respective revenues. The two games work iteratively such that the PNO and SNO reach a final equilibrium state at which neither PNO nor SNO will change its decisions unilaterally in both layers. We propose efficient algorithms to solve both the top layer and bottom layer games and compute the final equilibrium of the two-layered game. Specifically, despite the non-convexity of joint resource allocation optimization problem in the bottom layer, we identify its hidden monotonic structure and propose an efficient algorithm, which is based on the polyblock approximation, to achieve the optimal solutions. Moreover, in the top layer, to tackle with the difficulty due to the lack of an analytical objective function for the revenue sharing problem, we explore its hidden unimodal property and propose a Brent's method based algorithm to achieve the optimal solution. Numerical results are presented to verify the performance of our algorithms and show that our revenue sharing based resource allocation scheme yields a win-win situation for the PNO and SNO.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6985751/","chronOrPublicationDate":"November  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 December 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"32","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"November 2014","dateOfInsertion":"18 December 2014","accessionNumber":"14811246","displayDocTitle":"Revenue Sharing Based Resource Allocation for Dynamic Spectrum Access Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Revenue Sharing Based Resource Allocation for Dynamic Spectrum Access Networks","sourcePdf":"2280jsac1114wu2.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.032254S","chronDate":"November  2014","isNumber":"6985733","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"19","articleId":"6985751","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6985762,"authors":[{"name":"Ka Ming Mak","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Millimeter Waves, City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/6705689/6985762/lai-2382111-small.gif","p":["Ka-Ming Mak was born in Hong Kong.

Miniaturization and beamwidth enhancement of a patch antenna are the two main areas to be discussed. By folding the edge of the radiating patch with loading slots, the size of the patch antenna is 44.8% smaller than a conventional half wavelength patch, which allows it to be accommodated inside handsets easily. Wide beamwidth is obtained by surrounding the patch with a dielectric substrate and supporting the antenna by a metallic block. A measured half power beamwidth of 124\u00b0 is achieved. The impedance bandwidth of the antenna is over 10%, and the 3-dB axial ratio bandwidth is 3.05%. The proposed antenna covers a wide elevation angle and complete azimuth range. A parametric study of the effect of the metallic block and the surrounding dielectric substrate on the gain at a low elevation angle and the axial ratio of the proposed antenna are presented.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2014.2382111","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/6705689/06985762.pdf","startPage":"1521","endPage":"1529","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2014.2382111","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6705689","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Circularly Polarized Patch Antenna for Future 5G Mobile Phones","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 December 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6985762/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2014","displayDocTitle":"Circularly Polarized Patch Antenna for Future 5G Mobile Phones","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2015","htmlLink":"/document/6985762/","accessionNumber":"14860609","volume":"2","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"2014","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Circularly Polarized Patch Antenna for Future 5G Mobile Phones","sourcePdf":"access-lai-2382111-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.06209S","chronDate":"2014","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"6705689","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"52","xplore-issue":"6705689","articleId":"6985762","onlineDate":"18 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6985899,"authors":[{"name":"Ning Wang","affiliation":["The University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, CA"],"firstName":"Ning","lastName":"Wang"},{"name":"Xuegui Song","affiliation":["The University of British Columbia Faculty of Medicine, Vancouver, BC, CA"],"firstName":"Xuegui","lastName":"Song"},{"name":"Julian Cheng","affiliation":["The University of British Columbia Faculty of Medicine, Vancouver, BC, CA"],"firstName":"Julian","lastName":"Cheng"},{"name":"Victor C.

A private secret-key-based cryptosystem with key management is introduced to enhance FSO security, and a key agreement approach is proposed based on statistics of the random atmospheric-turbulence-induced fading channel measurements. The secret key rate of the key agreement scheme is investigated for the gamma-gamma turbulence model. Practical key agreement protocols based on bidirectional channel identification are designed for different FSO communication scenarios. Our numerical results reveal that the key rate is not sensitive to the strength of the atmospheric turbulence; the per-symbol signal-to-noise ratio and the training sequence length are the dominating factors.","doi":"10.1109/JOCN.2014.6985899","publicationTitle":"IEEE/OSA Journal of Optical Communications and Networking","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/OSA Journal of Optical Communications and Networking","pdfPath":"/iel7/4563700/6985894/06985899.pdf","startPage":"1072","endPage":"1081","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JOCN.2014.6985899","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6985894","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Enhancing the security of free-space optical communications with secret sharing and key agreement","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6985899/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 December 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2014","displayDocTitle":"Enhancing the security of free-space optical communications with secret sharing and key agreement","volume":"6","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2014","accessionNumber":"14811225","dateOfInsertion":"18 December 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Enhancing the security of free-space optical communications with secret sharing and key agreement","sourcePdf":"1072.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.028528S","chronDate":"Dec.  2014","isNumber":"6985894","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4563700","citationCount":"14","articleId":"6985899","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":6985926,"authors":[{"name":"Valery U.

About two decades ago researchers produced an idea to use reflected GNSS signals for remote-sensing applications. In this new concept a GNSS transmitter together with a receiver capable of processing GNSS scattered signals of opportunity becomes bistatic radar. By properly processing the scattered signal, this system can be configured either as an altimeter, or a scatterometer allowing us to estimate such characteristics of land or ocean surface as height, roughness, or dielectric properties of the underlying media. From there, using various methods the geophysical parameters can be estimated such as mesoscale ocean topography, ocean surface winds, soil moisture, vegetation, snowpack, and sea ice. Depending on the platform of the GNSS receiver (stationary, airborne, or spaceborne), the capabilities of this technique and specific methods for processing of the reflected signals may vary. In this tutorial, we describe this new remotesensing technique, discuss some of the interesting results that have been already obtained, and give an overview of current and planned spacecraft missions.","doi":"10.1109/MGRS.2014.2374220","publicationTitle":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel7/6245518/6985906/06985926.pdf","startPage":"8","endPage":"45","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6985906","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MGRS.2014.2374220","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Tutorial on Remote Sensing Using GNSS Bistatic Radar of Opportunity","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6985926","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2014","displayDocTitle":"Tutorial on Remote Sensing Using GNSS Bistatic Radar of Opportunity","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6985926/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2015","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"15432640","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6985926/","volume":"2","issue":"4","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  2014","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Tutorial on Remote Sensing Using GNSS Bistatic Radar of Opportunity","sourcePdf":"02mgrs04-zavorotny-2374220-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.33399S","chronDate":"Dec.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"6245518","isNumber":"6985906","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6245518","citationCount":"242","xplore-issue":"6985906","articleId":"6985926","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6985951,"authors":[{"name":"Frederic Sala","affiliation":["University of California Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, US"],"bio":{"p":["Frederic Sala (fredSala@ucla.edu) earned the B.S.E. degree in electrical engineering from the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, in 2010.

Reference implementations exist for different variants of the algorithm and were already shown to be faster than state-of-the-art FFT implementations in cases of sufficient sparsity. However, to date the SFFT has not been carefully optimized for modern processors. In this paper, we first analyze the performance of the existing SFFT implementations and discuss possible improvements. Then we present an optimized implementation. We achieve a speedup of 2-5 compared to the existing code and an efficiency that is competitive to highperformance FFT libraries.","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE Workshop on Signal Processing Systems (SiPS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6973465/6986048/06986055.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE Workshop on Signal Processing Systems (SiPS)","doi":"10.1109/SiPS.2014.6986055","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SiPS.2014.6986055","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6986048","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6986055","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High-performance sparse fast Fourier transforms","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Runtime","Optimization","Vectors","Signal processing algorithms","Frequency estimation","Discrete Fourier transforms","Probabilistic logic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discrete Fourier transforms","software libraries","software performance evaluation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high-performance sparse fast Fourier transforms","SFFT algorithm","discrete Fourier transforms","sparse frequency domain","asymptotic runtime improvement","performance analysis","high-performance FFT libraries"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Fast Fourier transform","Software performance","SIMD processors"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6986055/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 Oct. 2014","displayDocTitle":"High-performance sparse fast Fourier transforms","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6986055/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","accessionNumber":"14823185","dateOfInsertion":"18 December 2014","conferenceDate":"20-22 Oct. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High-performance sparse fast Fourier transforms","confLoc":"Belfast, UK","sourcePdf":"312.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050686S","chronDate":"20-22 Oct. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6973465","isNumber":"6986048","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6973465","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"6986048","articleId":"6986055","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":6986056,"authors":[{"name":"Nanoka Sumi","affiliation":["Fukuoka Daigaku, Fukuoka, Fukuoka, JP"],"firstName":"Nanoka","lastName":"Sumi"},{"name":"Akiya Baba","affiliation":["Fukuoka Daigaku, Fukuoka, Fukuoka, JP"],"firstName":"Akiya","lastName":"Baba"},{"name":"Vasily G.

Each IPPro core uses 1 DSP48, 1 Block RAM and 330 Kintex-7 slice-registers, thus making the processor as compact as possible whilst maintaining flexibility and programmability. A key aspect of the approach is in reducing the application design time and implementation effort by using multiple IPPro processors in a SIMD mode. For different applications, this allows us to exploit different levels of parallelism and mapping for the specified processing architecture with the supported instruction set. In this context, a Traffic Sign Recognition (TSR) algorithm has been prototyped on a Zedboard with the colour and morphology operations accelerated using multiple IPPros. Simulation and experimental results demonstrate that the processing platform is able to achieve a speedup of 15 to 33 times for colour filtering and morphology operations respectively, with a reduced design effort and time.","doi":"10.1109/SiPS.2014.6986057","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE Workshop on Signal Processing Systems (SiPS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE Workshop on Signal Processing Systems (SiPS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6973465/6986048/06986057.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SiPS.2014.6986057","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6986048","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6986057","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"IPPro: FPGA based image processing processor","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 Oct. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6986057/","displayDocTitle":"IPPro: FPGA based image processing processor","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6986057/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"18 December 2014","conferenceDate":"20-22 Oct. 2014","accessionNumber":"14823155","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"IPPro: FPGA based image processing processor","confLoc":"Belfast, UK","sourcePdf":"553.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061254S","chronDate":"20-22 Oct. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6973465","isNumber":"6986048","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6973465","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"6986048","articleId":"6986057","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6986058,"authors":[{"name":"Junlin Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Connecticut, CT, USA"],"firstName":"Junlin","lastName":"Chen","id":"37072582000"},{"name":"Lei Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Connecticut, CT, USA"],"firstName":"Lei","lastName":"Wang","id":"37293100600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6588-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2162-3562"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2162-3570"}],"articleNumber":"6986058","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":130},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6986058","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Batteries","Renewable energy sources","Signal processing","Energy consumption","Discrete cosine transforms","Sensors","Image quality"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discrete cosine transforms","energy conservation","image processing","image sensors","renewable energy sources"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["self-sustained signal processing systems","energy-adaptive performance management technique","embedded signal processing system design","renewable energy sources","nondeterministic characteristics","energy consumption","progressive performance tuning approach","runtime energy level","battery capacity","DCT-based image sensing system","adaptive signal processing kernel tuning","energy efficiency","unstable harvested energy"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["self-sustained embedded systems","energy harvesting","energy management","time coverage","energy efficiency"]}],"doi":"10.1109/SiPS.2014.6986058","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE Workshop on Signal Processing Systems (SiPS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE Workshop on Signal Processing Systems (SiPS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6973465/6986048/06986058.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SiPS.2014.6986058","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6986048","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy-adaptive performance management for self-sustained signal processing systems","abstract":"This paper presents an energy-adaptive performance management technique for the design of embedded signal processing systems powered by renewable energy sources.

Among those, the emerging High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC) provides a better video quality for the same bit rate than the previous H.264 standard. A limitation in the usability of a mobile video playing device is the lack of support for guaranteeing stand-by time and up time for battery driven devices. The Green Metadata initiative within the MPEG standard was launched to address the power saving issues of the decoder and defines the technology requirements. In this paper, we propose a HEVC decoder with tunable decoding quality levels for maximum power savings as suggested in the scope of the Green Metadata initiative.

However, scaling beyond the critical voltage or frequency results to numerous timing errors, and hence unacceptable output quality. In this paper, a computation-skip (CS) scheme is proposed for recursive digital signal processors with a fixed cycles per instruction (CPI) to correct timing errors. A CORDIC processor with the proposed CS scheme still functions when scaling beyond the sub-critical voltage or frequency. It improves EVM by 47.9 dB at its most critical frequency or supply voltage, and extends the voltage scaling limit by 90 mV w.r.t the conventional CORDIC. Besides, it is more than 1.7X energy efficient w.r.t. the conventional high-speed CORDIC, which is designed for a more aggressive scaling.","doi":"10.1109/SiPS.2014.6986061","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE Workshop on Signal Processing Systems (SiPS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE Workshop on Signal Processing Systems (SiPS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6973465/6986048/06986061.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SiPS.2014.6986061","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6986048","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Computation-skip error resilient scheme for recursive CORDIC","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"20-22 Oct. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6986061/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 Oct. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Computation-skip error resilient scheme for recursive CORDIC","dateOfInsertion":"18 December 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6986061/","accessionNumber":"14823192","publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Computation-skip error resilient scheme for recursive CORDIC","confLoc":"Belfast, UK","sourcePdf":"933.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.149942S","chronDate":"20-22 Oct. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6973465","isNumber":"6986048","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6973465","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6986048","articleId":"6986061","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6986062,"authors":[{"name":"Jun Lin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Lehigh University, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Jun","lastName":"Lin","id":"38247795900"},{"name":"Chenrong Xiong","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Lehigh University, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Chenrong","lastName":"Xiong","id":"38242680000"},{"name":"Zhiyuan Yan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Lehigh University, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Zhiyuan","lastName":"Yan","id":"37274912700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6588-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2162-3562"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2162-3570"}],"articleNumber":"6986062","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":21,"citationCountPatent":12,"totalDownloads":903},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Government"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cyclic codes","cyclic redundancy check codes","decoding","error correction codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["reduced latency list decoding algorithm","RLLD algorithm","polar codes","cyclic redundancy check","CRC","successive cancellation list","SCL decoding algorithm","list maximum-likelihood decoding","LMLD algorithm","computational complexity","decoding clock cycles","decoding latency"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6986062","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE Workshop on Signal Processing Systems (SiPS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6973465/6986048/06986062.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SiPS.2014.6986062","doi":"10.1109/SiPS.2014.6986062","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6986048","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE Workshop on Signal Processing Systems (SiPS)","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A reduced latency list decoding algorithm for polar codes","abstract":"The cyclic redundancy check (CRC) aided successive cancelation list (SCL) decoding algorithm has better error performance than the successive cancelation (SC) decoding algorithm for short or moderate polar codes.

This paper proposes two schemes to address multi-way channels when a set of terminals wants to exchange data. Both proposed schemes consist of a first phase based on virtual MIMO with lattice reduction-aided (LRA) detection at the relay, establishing a multiple access channel (MAC). Two new strategies are then proposed for the second (multicast) phase; one for single antenna terminals and another for multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) terminals. The second strategy achieves interference suppression by successively combining physical layer network coding and MIMO detection (with LRA detectors also at the terminals). The paper assesses a 3 terminals network with a relay for which a TDMA-based scheme would require 6 time-slots, while the proposed strategy for MIMO terminals is able to exchange the information between all terminals using 2 time-slots only. This latter scheme is easily scalable to a higher number of terminals, and always able to accomplish the exchange of messages between all of them in just 2 time-slots, although limited by the number of antennas that the terminals can fit and also the MIMO processing complexity they can afford.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Interference suppression with physical-layer network coding and MIMO for multi-way channels","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE Workshop on Signal Processing Systems (SiPS)","doi":"10.1109/SiPS.2014.6986065","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE Workshop on Signal Processing Systems (SiPS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6973465/6986048/06986065.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SiPS.2014.6986065","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6986048","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6986065","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6986065/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 Oct. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Interference suppression with physical-layer network coding and MIMO for multi-way channels","conferenceDate":"20-22 Oct. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6986065/","dateOfInsertion":"18 December 2014","publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","accessionNumber":"14823203","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Interference suppression with physical-layer network coding and MIMO for multi-way channels","confLoc":"Belfast, UK","sourcePdf":"1362.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041055S","chronDate":"20-22 Oct. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6973465","isNumber":"6986048","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6973465","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6986048","articleId":"6986065","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":6986071,"authors":[{"name":"Janne Janhunen","affiliation":["Centre for Wireless Communications, University of Oulu"],"firstName":"Janne","lastName":"Janhunen","id":"37593856300"},{"name":"Pekka J\u00e4\u00e4skel\u00e4inen","affiliation":["Department of Pervasive Computing, Tampere University of Technology"],"firstName":"Pekka","lastName":"J\u00e4\u00e4skel\u00e4inen","id":"37298508200"},{"name":"Jari Hannuksela","affiliation":["Computer Science and Engineering department, University of Oulu"],"firstName":"Jari","lastName":"Hannuksela","id":"37550509500"},{"name":"Tero Rintaluoma","affiliation":["Google, Finland"],"firstName":"Tero","lastName":"Rintaluoma","id":"37593858100"},{"name":"Aki Kuusela","affiliation":["Google, Finland"],"firstName":"Aki","lastName":"Kuusela","id":"37085595075"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6588-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2162-3562"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2162-3570"}],"articleNumber":"6986071","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":115},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6986071","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computer architecture","Clocks","Parallel processing","Hardware","Algorithm design and analysis","Complexity theory","Vectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["instruction sets","programmable filters","video coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["programmable in-loop deblock filter processor","video decoders","video processing algorithms","application specific instruction set processor","ASIP design","domain specific instruction set processor architecture","DSIP architecture","VP8 in-loop deblocking algorithms","transport triggered architecture","instruction-level parallelism","C language","high definition video","high definition stream","programmability"]}],"abstract":"The short time to market cycle and the target to reduce design and verification costs are driving forces to design programmable implementations of the video processing algorithms.

We show that (1) at lower Data Storage Time (DST), the proposed system which has different ECC schemes for DRAM and PRAM has the longest lifetime and one of the highest IPC; (2) at higher DST, stronger ECC codes are necessary for all the systems and longer lifetime can be achieved at the cost of decrease in IPC.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low cost ECC schemes for improving the reliability of DRAM+PRAMMAIN memory systems","doi":"10.1109/SiPS.2014.6986076","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SiPS.2014.6986076","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6986048","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE Workshop on Signal Processing Systems (SiPS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE Workshop on Signal Processing Systems (SiPS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6973465/6986048/06986076.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6986076","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6986076/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 Oct. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Low cost ECC schemes for improving the reliability of DRAM+PRAMMAIN memory systems","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6986076/","dateOfInsertion":"18 December 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","accessionNumber":"14823189","conferenceDate":"20-22 Oct. 2014","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low cost ECC schemes for improving the reliability of DRAM+PRAMMAIN memory systems","confLoc":"Belfast, UK","sourcePdf":"2531.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.095898S","chronDate":"20-22 Oct. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6973465","isNumber":"6986048","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6973465","xplore-issue":"6986048","articleId":"6986076","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6986077,"authors":[{"name":"Shigui Qi","affiliation":["Wuhan National Lab for Optoelectronics School of Computer, Huazhong University of Science and Technology","School of Information Engineering, Xuchang University"],"firstName":"Shigui","lastName":"Qi","id":"37085512781"},{"name":"Dan Feng","affiliation":["Wuhan National Lab for Optoelectronics School of Computer, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"],"firstName":"Dan","lastName":"Feng","id":"37289600400"},{"name":"Jingning Liu","affiliation":["Wuhan National Lab for Optoelectronics School of Computer, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"],"firstName":"Jingning","lastName":"Liu","id":"37405251100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6588-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2162-3562"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2162-3570"}],"articleNumber":"6986077","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":591},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6986077","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sensors","Threshold voltage","Ash","Parity check codes","Energy consumption","Entropy","Noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decoding","energy consumption","error correction codes","flash memories","parity check codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimal voltage signal sensing","NAND flash memory","LDPC decoder","low-density parity-check code","error correcting performance","soft-decision log-likelihood ratio","LLR","threshold voltage sensing operations","energy consumption","latency penalty"]}],"abstract":"Low-density parity-check (LDPC) code can provide stronger error correcting performance in NAND flash memory. LDPC decoder requires accurate soft-decision log-likelihood ratio (LLR) information which demands fine-grained flash memory threshold voltage sensing operations. The threshold voltage sensing operations incur energy consumption and access latency penalty. Therefore, it is important to minimize the flash memory sensing operations without noticeable error correcting performance decreasing. We propose a new flash memory sensing strategy Ununiform-SOR (ununiform sensing in overlapping region) which can reduce 20% flash memory sensing operations than traditional non-uniform threshold voltage sensing without reducing the error correcting performance of LDPC code in NAND flash memory noise channel. The new Ununiform-SOR sensing strategy can reduce more than 20% reading energy consumption than the non-uniform sensing strategy.

Thus, it is important to precisely measure the value of capacitances to remove the interferences and lower the bit-error rate. Previous approaches have employed the least mean square (LMS) or the least square adaptive filtering approaches to remove the interference and thereby indirectly assess the capacitance values. In this paper, we measure the capacitance values directly by using specific cell programming patterns. It is found that the capacitance values do not change according to the PE (program erase) cycles, thus the measurement can be conducted only once for a fresh chip. We show the comparison results between the direct and the least squares based methods. The direct method not only provides the statistical distribution of the capacitance values but also shows more accurate estimation when the interference is very severe. The indirect methods that employ adaptive filtering have the advantage of using existing data instead of writing specific patterns.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Couplings","Threshold voltage","Programming","Ash","Semiconductor device measurement","Interference","Voltage measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error statistics","flash memories","interference","least squares approximations","NAND circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["indirect measurement","intercell capacitance","NAND flash memory","adaptive filtering","direct method","least squares based method","program erase cycles","PE cycles","cell programming patterns","capacitance value measurement","bit-error rate","interference removal","bit errors","capacitive coupling","cell-to-cell interference"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cell-to-cell interference","NAND flash memory","least squares","LMS adaptive filter"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6986078","doi":"10.1109/SiPS.2014.6986078","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE Workshop on Signal Processing Systems (SiPS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE Workshop on Signal Processing Systems (SiPS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6973465/6986048/06986078.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6986048","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SiPS.2014.6986078","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6986078/","displayDocTitle":"Direct and indirect measurement of inter-cell capacitance in NAND flash memory","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 Oct. 2014","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"18 December 2014","accessionNumber":"14823199","htmlLink":"/document/6986078/","conferenceDate":"20-22 Oct. 2014","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Direct and indirect measurement of inter-cell capacitance in NAND flash memory","confLoc":"Belfast, UK","sourcePdf":"2746.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056264S","chronDate":"20-22 Oct. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6973465","isNumber":"6986048","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6973465","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6986048","articleId":"6986078","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6986082,"authors":[{"name":"Kyuyeon Hwang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Kyuyeon","lastName":"Hwang","id":"38468750500"},{"name":"Wonyong Sung","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Wonyong","lastName":"Sung","id":"37290807000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6588-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2162-3562"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2162-3570"}],"articleNumber":"6986082","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":100,"citationCountPatent":13,"totalDownloads":4161},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6986082","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Quantization (signal)","Training","Backpropagation","Hardware","Error analysis","Feedforward neural networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["backpropagation","character recognition","feedforward neural nets","fixed point arithmetic","signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fixed-point feedforward deep neural network design","hardware complexity","backpropagation based retraining","ternary weights","3-bit signal","quantized weights","fixed-point signal","character recognition","phoneme recognition"]}],"abstract":"Feedforward deep neural networks that employ multiple hidden layers show high performance in many applications, but they demand complex hardware for implementation.

In addition, a two-stage list pruning network is proposed to simplify the list pruning network for the symbol-based SC list decoding algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/SiPS.2014.6986086","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SiPS.2014.6986086","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE Workshop on Signal Processing Systems (SiPS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE Workshop on Signal Processing Systems (SiPS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6973465/6986048/06986086.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6986048","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Symbol-based successive cancellation list decoder for polar codes","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6986086/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 Oct. 2014","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Symbol-based successive cancellation list decoder for polar codes","conferenceDate":"20-22 Oct. 2014","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"18 December 2014","publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","accessionNumber":"14823200","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6986086/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Symbol-based successive cancellation list decoder for polar codes","confLoc":"Belfast, UK","sourcePdf":"3543.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057014S","chronDate":"20-22 Oct. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6973465","isNumber":"6986048","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6973465","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"6986048","articleId":"6986086","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6986087,"authors":[{"name":"Michal Stala","affiliation":["Lund University"],"firstName":"Michal","lastName":"Stala"},{"name":"Ove Edfors","affiliation":["Lund University"],"firstName":"Ove","lastName":"Edfors"},{"name":"Viktor \u00d6wall","affiliation":["Lund University"],"firstName":"Viktor","lastName":"\u00d6wall"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6588-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2162-3562"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2162-3570"}],"articleNumber":"6986087","dbTime":"17 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":124},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","Discrete Fourier transforms","Doppler effect","Quantization (signal)","OFDM","Frequency-domain analysis","Hardware"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","discrete Fourier transforms","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DFT-based channel estimation","discrete Fourier transforms","OFDM systems","ASIC","channel increments","channel coefficients","mobility scenario","Doppler frequency","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","frequency 5 Hz","size 65 nm"]}],"abstract":"A new architecture for Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) based channel estimation has been analyzed, implemented and synthesized for ASIC. The core concept of the proposed estimation algorithm is to process the channel increments rather than the channel coefficients. With strong enough time correlation, we can reduce the wordlength of processing blocks compared to standard channel estimators and hence the resulting area and power. We provide an analytical tool to predict the potential gains in bit reduction for different mobility scenarios. Our simulations show that the wordlength can be reduced from 9 to 3 bits when operating in low mobility scenarios, with 5Hz Doppler frequency, while maintaining acceptable performance. Synthesis results show up to 40% reduction in area, compared to the original DFT-based approach, in a 65nm CMOS process.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Implementation of a novel architecture for DFT-based channel estimators in OFDM systems","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE Workshop on Signal Processing Systems (SiPS)","doi":"10.1109/SiPS.2014.6986087","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE Workshop on Signal Processing Systems (SiPS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6973465/6986048/06986087.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SiPS.2014.6986087","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6986048","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6986087","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6986087/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 Oct. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Implementation of a novel architecture for DFT-based channel estimators in OFDM systems","conferenceDate":"20-22 Oct. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6986087/","dateOfInsertion":"18 December 2014","publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","accessionNumber":"14823168","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Implementation of a novel architecture for DFT-based channel estimators in OFDM systems","confLoc":"Belfast, UK","sourcePdf":"3648.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07242S","chronDate":"20-22 Oct. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6973465","isNumber":"6986048","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6973465","xplore-issue":"6986048","articleId":"6986087","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":6986088,"authors":[{"name":"Chris Ceroici","affiliation":["University of Waterloo, Waterloo, ON, CA"],"firstName":"Chris","lastName":"Ceroici"},{"name":"Vincent C.

Most of them do not perform well when the image is partially occluded or smudged. Humans are able to tolerate much worse image quality during reading because the perception errors can be corrected by the knowledge in word and sentence level context. In this paper, we present a brain-inspired information processing framework for context-aware Intelligent Text Recognition (ITR) and its acceleration using memristor based crossbar array. The ITRS has a bottom layer of massive parallel Brain-state-in-a-box (BSB) engines that give fuzzy pattern matching results and an upper layer of statistical inference based error correction. The framework works robustly in noisy environment. A parallel architecture is presented that incorporates the memristor crossbar array to accelerate the pattern matching. Compared to traditional microprocessor, the accelerator has the potential to provide tremendous area and power savings and more than 8,000 times speedups.","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE Workshop on Signal Processing Systems (SiPS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6973465/6986048/06986098.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE Workshop on Signal Processing Systems (SiPS)","doi":"10.1109/SiPS.2014.6986098","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SiPS.2014.6986098","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6986048","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6986098","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neuromorphic acceleration for context aware text image recognition","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Government","Electromagnetic interference","IEC standards","IEC"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fuzzy set theory","image matching","memristors","optical character recognition","parallel architectures","statistical analysis","text detection","ubiquitous computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neuromorphic acceleration","context aware text image recognition","optical character recognition tool","OCR tools","text image detection","pattern recognition","word level context","sentence level context","brain-inspired information processing framework","context-aware intelligent text recognition","memristor based crossbar array","ITRS","parallel brain-state-in-a-box engines","fuzzy pattern matching","statistical inference based error correction","parallel architecture"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["neuromorphic","text recognition","memristor crossbar array"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6986098/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 Oct. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Neuromorphic acceleration for context aware text image recognition","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6986098/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","accessionNumber":"14823171","dateOfInsertion":"18 December 2014","conferenceDate":"20-22 Oct. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neuromorphic acceleration for context aware text image recognition","confLoc":"Belfast, UK","sourcePdf":"4899.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060985S","chronDate":"20-22 Oct. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6973465","isNumber":"6986048","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6973465","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6986048","articleId":"6986098","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6986114,"authors":[{"name":"Mohammad Mehdi Zeinali Zadeh","affiliation":["University of Waterloo, ON, Canada"],"firstName":"Mohammad Mehdi","lastName":"Zeinali Zadeh","id":"37085561522"},{"name":"Mahmoud Salem","affiliation":["University of Waterloo, ON, Canada"],"firstName":"Mahmoud","lastName":"Salem","id":"37085560190"},{"name":"Neeraj Kumar","affiliation":["University of Waterloo, ON, Canada"],"firstName":"Neeraj","lastName":"Kumar","id":"37085550024"},{"name":"Greta Cutulenco","affiliation":["University of Waterloo, ON, Canada"],"firstName":"Greta","lastName":"Cutulenco","id":"37085548916"},{"name":"Sebastian Fischmeister","affiliation":["University of Waterloo, ON, Canada"],"firstName":"Sebastian","lastName":"Fischmeister","id":"37402998600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4503-3052-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6986114","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":185},"abstract":"Given a set of historic good traces, trace-based anomaly detection deals with the problem of determining whether or not a specific trace represents a normal execution scenario. Most current approaches mainly focus on application areas outside of the embedded systems domain and thus do not take advantage of the intrinsic properties of this domain. This work introduces SiPTA, a novel technique for offline trace-based anomaly detection that utilizes the intrinsic feature of periodicity found in embedded systems. SiPTA uses signal processing as the underlying processing algorithm. The paper describes a generic framework for mapping execution traces to channels and signals for further processing. The classification stage of SiPTA uses a comprehensive set of metrics adapted from standard signal processing. The system is particularly useful for embedded systems, and the paper demonstrates this by comparing SiPTA with state-of-the-art approaches based on Markov Model and Neural Networks. The paper shows the technical feasibility and viability of SiPTA through multiple case studies using traces from a field-tested hexacopter, a mobile phone platform, and a car infotainment unit. In the experiments, our approach outperformed every other tested method.","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 International Conference on Embedded Software (EMSOFT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6963746/6986108/06986114.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"10","publicationTitle":"2014 International Conference on Embedded Software (EMSOFT)","doi":"10.1145/2656045.2656071","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1145/2656045.2656071","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6986108","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6986114","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"SiPTA: Signal processing for trace-based anomaly detection","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Measurement","Time series analysis","Training","Hidden Markov models","Feature extraction","Signal processing algorithms","Indexes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["embedded systems","signal classification"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["SiPTA","signal processing for trace-based anomaly detection","normal execution scenario","embedded system domain","offline trace-based anomaly detection","execution trace mapping","Markov Model","neural networks","field-tested hexacopter","mobile phone platform","car infotainment unit"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6986114/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-17 Oct. 2014","displayDocTitle":"SiPTA: Signal processing for trace-based anomaly detection","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6986114/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","accessionNumber":"14820573","dateOfInsertion":"18 December 2014","conferenceDate":"12-17 Oct. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SiPTA: Signal processing for trace-based anomaly detection","confLoc":"Uttar Pradesh, India","sourcePdf":"EMSOFT32.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.080676S","chronDate":"12-17 Oct. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6963746","isNumber":"6986108","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6963746","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6986108","articleId":"6986114","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ACM","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6986137,"authors":[{"name":"Kan Zhong","affiliation":["College of Computer Science, Ministry of Education"],"firstName":"Kan","lastName":"Zhong","id":"37085338051"},{"name":"Tianzheng Wang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Toronto"],"firstName":"Tianzheng","lastName":"Wang","id":"38238888400"},{"name":"Xiao Zhu","affiliation":["College of Computer Science, Ministry of Education"],"firstName":"Xiao","lastName":"Zhu","id":"37085337915"},{"name":"Linbo Long","affiliation":["College of Computer Science, Ministry of Education"],"firstName":"Linbo","lastName":"Long","id":"37085338739"},{"name":"Duo Liu","affiliation":["College of Computer Science, Ministry of Education"],"firstName":"Duo","lastName":"Liu","id":"37402813400"},{"name":"Weichen Liu","affiliation":["College of Computer Science, Ministry of Education"],"firstName":"Weichen","lastName":"Liu","id":"37085338443"},{"name":"Zili Shao","affiliation":["Department of Computing, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University"],"firstName":"Zili","lastName":"Shao","id":"37276749700"},{"name":"Edwin H.-M.

However, the storage subsystem has always been a prohibitive factor that slows down the pace of reaching even higher performance while maintaining good user experience. Despite today's smart-phones are equipped with larger-than-ever main memories, they consume more energy and still run out of memory. But the slow NAND flash based storage vetoes the possibility of swapping-an important technique to extend main memory-and leaves a system that constantly terminates user applications under memory pressure. In this paper, we revisit swapping for smartphones with fast, byte-addressable, non-volatile memory (NVM) technologies. Instead of using flash, we build the swap area with NVM, to allow high performance without sacrificing user experience. Based on NVM's high performance and byte-addressability, we show that a copy-on-write swap-in scheme can achieve even better performance by avoiding unnecessary memory copy operations. To avoid fast worn-out of certain NVMs, we also propose Heap-Wear, a wear leveling algorithm that more evenly distributes writes in NVM. Evaluation results based on the Google Nexus 5 smartphone show that our solution can effectively enhance smartphone performance and give better wear-leveling of NVM.","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"12-17 Oct. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6986137/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6986137/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"14820559","conferenceDate":"12-17 Oct. 2014","publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"18 December 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Building high-performance smartphones via non-volatile memory: The swap approach","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Building high-performance smartphones via non-volatile memory: The swap approach","confLoc":"Uttar Pradesh, India","sourcePdf":"EMSOFT82.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.12982S","chronDate":"12-17 Oct. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6963746","isNumber":"6986108","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6963746","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"6986108","articleId":"6986137","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ACM","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":6986139,"authors":[{"name":"Shi-Qi Liu","affiliation":["Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Short-Range Wireless Detection and Communication, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China"],"firstName":"Shi-Qi","lastName":"Liu","id":"38263037400"},{"name":"Bin-Jie Hu","affiliation":["Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Short-Range Wireless Detection and Communication, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China"],"firstName":"Bin-Jie","lastName":"Hu","id":"37085454963"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-5274-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-5272-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6986139","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":199},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Detectors","Cognitive radio","Error analysis","Optimization","Performance evaluation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","cooperative communication","probability","radio spectrum management","signal detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cooperative spectrum sensing","cognitive radios","energy detector","false alarm probability"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["cognitive radio","spectrum sensing","energy detection","optimization"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cooperative spectrum sensing based on improved energy detector for cognitive radios","doi":"10.1109/ICSPCC.2014.6986139","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6986138","endPage":"4","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Conference on Signal Processing, Communications and Computing (ICSPCC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Conference on Signal Processing, Communications and Computing (ICSPCC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6971897/6986138/06986139.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSPCC.2014.6986139","startPage":"1","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6986139","abstract":"Energy detector has become a popular detector in spectrum sensing for cognitive radio.

The AMSA introduces adaptive factors to reduce the total computation time, and adds memory function to save the recently visited solutions and best solution by now.

It is known to all that fast Fourier transformation (FFT) is an effective method for power signal harmonic analysis, but aliasing effect, picket fence effect, spectrum leakage and spectrum disturbance make it suffer from inevitable limitation. In this paper, to solve the above problems of FFT, an all-digital synchronous sampling algorithm for high-precision harmonic analysis is proposed, which is suitable for the implementation of very large scale integration (VLSI). The main idea of this algorithm is to make the decimation ratio of the decimation filter of a oversampling analog-to-digital converter(OSADC) dynamically associate with the fundamental frequency of the power signals, which is irregularly fluctuant but can be real-time tracked by the frequency estimation algorithm, designed in this paper. As a result, the average sampling frequency of the decimation filter output can change with the input signal frequency. Compared with the software synchronous sampling and asynchronous sampling methods, the proposed algorithm can be implemented more easily and needs much less hardware costs.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Frequency estimation","Harmonic analysis","Power harmonic filters","Noise","Mathematical model","Equations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analogue-digital conversion","frequency estimation","harmonic analysis","power system harmonics","sampling methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["harmonic analysis algorithm","synchronous sampling","all-digital synchronous sampling algorithm","high-precision harmonic analysis","very large scale integration","VLSI","decimation filter","decimation ratio","oversampling analog-to-digital converter","OSADC","frequency estimation algorithm","software synchronous sampling"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["harmonic analysis","FFT","synchronous sampling","decimation filter","frequency estimation"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICSPCC.2014.6986167","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Conference on Signal Processing, Communications and Computing (ICSPCC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Conference on Signal Processing, Communications and Computing (ICSPCC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6971897/6986138/06986167.pdf","startPage":"128","endPage":"132","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6986138","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSPCC.2014.6986167","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A harmonic analysis algorithm based on synchronous sampling","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6986167","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A harmonic analysis algorithm based on synchronous sampling","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6986167/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6986167/","accessionNumber":"14822812","conferenceDate":"5-8 Aug. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"18 December 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 Aug. 2014","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A harmonic analysis algorithm based on synchronous sampling","confLoc":"Guilin, China","sourcePdf":"1881.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06928S","chronDate":"5-8 Aug. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6971897","isNumber":"6986138","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6971897","xplore-issue":"6986138","articleId":"6986167","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6986171,"authors":[{"name":"Daoxiang Dou","affiliation":["Electronic Engineering Department, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, Sichuan, China"],"firstName":"Daoxiang","lastName":"Dou","id":"37085392917"},{"name":"Zishu He","affiliation":["Electronic Engineering Department, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, Sichuan, China"],"firstName":"Zishu","lastName":"He","id":"37278355000"},{"name":"Mao Li","affiliation":["Electronic Engineering Department, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, Sichuan, China"],"firstName":"Mao","lastName":"Li","id":"37076814000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-5274-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-5272-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6986171","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":155},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Clutter","Doppler effect","Radar","Arrays","US Department of Defense","Source separation","Receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["blind source separation","MIMO radar","radar clutter","radar detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multimode clutter suppression","MIMO-OTH radar system","blind source separation","spread-doppler clutter","multimode propagation","over-the-horizon radar detection","ships","multimode SDC suppresion","multiple-input multiple-output over-the-horizon","processing algorithms","multimode clutter suppression algorithm","second-order blind identification","SOBI technology"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MIMO-OTH radar","multi-mode clutter suppression","blind source separation","SOBI"]}],"abstract":"Spread-Doppler clutter (SDC) caused by multi-mode propagation seriously affects the over-the-horizon radar (OTHR) detection performance for slow ships. To solve this problem, we propose to suppress multi-mode SDC using spatial information in the multiple-input multiple-output over-the-horizon (MIMO-OTH) radar system. Traditional processing algorithms need priori information of the target direction, which is often not readily available. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-mode clutter suppression algorithm based on the second-order blind identification (SOBI) technology. The proposed algorithm does not need prior information of the target direction and can effectively suppress the multi-mode clutter. Simulation results show that the method not only achieves better suppression of the multi-mode SDC, but also retains the clutter information which contains a lot of useful information in many cases.","doi":"10.1109/ICSPCC.2014.6986171","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Conference on Signal Processing, Communications and Computing (ICSPCC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Conference on Signal Processing, Communications and Computing (ICSPCC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6971897/6986138/06986171.pdf","startPage":"147","endPage":"152","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSPCC.2014.6986171","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6986138","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-mode clutter suppression of MIMO-OTH radar using blind source separation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6986171","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 Aug. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6986171/","displayDocTitle":"Multi-mode clutter suppression of MIMO-OTH radar using blind source separation","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2014","accessionNumber":"14822759","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6986171/","conferenceDate":"5-8 Aug. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"18 December 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-mode clutter suppression of MIMO-OTH radar using blind source separation","confLoc":"Guilin, China","sourcePdf":"1891.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053404S","chronDate":"5-8 Aug. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6971897","isNumber":"6986138","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6971897","xplore-issue":"6986138","articleId":"6986171","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6986173,"authors":[{"name":"Pan Zhou","affiliation":["Peking University, Beijing, Beijing, CN"],"firstName":"Pan","lastName":"Zhou"},{"name":"Teng Wang","affiliation":["Peking University, Beijing, Beijing, CN"],"firstName":"Teng","lastName":"Wang"},{"name":"Xin'an Wang","affiliation":["Peking University, Beijing, Beijing, CN"],"firstName":"Xin'an","lastName":"Wang"},{"name":"Yinhui Wang","affiliation":["Peking University, Beijing, Beijing, CN"],"firstName":"Yinhui","lastName":"Wang"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-5274-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-5272-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6986173","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":376},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Clocks","Power demand","Synchronization","Hardware","Field programmable gate arrays","Conferences","Data transfer"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["application specific integrated circuits","CMOS integrated circuits","finite state machines","integrated circuit design","low-power electronics","memory cards"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CSMC CMOS technology","FPGA prototyping","FIFO","finite state machine","CIU","BIU","asynchronous units","ASIC design","SD card controller","hardware implementation","size 180 nm","frequency 100 MHz","power 8.2223 mW"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["low power consumption","SD card controller","asynchronous units","FSM adding low power mode","one FIFO"]}],"abstract":"Technical innovation drives the low power consumption requirements in ASIC design.

The aim is to find the patterns that deviate too much from others. In this paper, a universal outlier detection method based on normalized residual is proposed. Different from previous methods, the residual of a pattern is calculated corresponding to its nearest normal patterns, so that the interaction between outliers is eliminated. To implement this, the method first estimates the center of normal patterns and derives the initial set of them, and then iteratively calculates the residual of the nearest pattern outside the set. Those with small residuals will be added to the set of normal patterns, and others are picked out as outliers. An effective distance weighting is also introduced to the calculation of the normalized residual.

The radar radio signal is downshifted and sampled by receive-transmit time-sharing antenna and then stored to digital memory. Its retransmitting signal reserves the coherent property so that a large number of false targets will be achieved after matched filter of the pulse compression radar.

However, the flipping operation which tries to improve the sequence quality is not cost effective. We use the crossover and mutation operators in GA to substitute the flipping operation and obtain much gain in terms of both merit factor and coded factor.

Multi-Input Multi-Output (MIMO) radar can be used to form a synthetic aperture for high resolution imaging. To successfully utilize the MIMO synthetic aperture radar (SAR) system for practical imaging application, the orthogonal waveform design plays a critical role in image formation. Focusing on the SAR application, a definition for synthetic integrated side-lobe level ratio (ISLR) is proposed. The autocorrelation peak side-lobe level ratio (A-PSLR) of discrete frequency-coding waveform with fixed frequency pulses (DFCW_FF) is very large. Replacing the fixed frequency pulses with linear frequency modulated (LFM) pulses can lower the A-PSLR. Changing between the up -and down-chirp waveform can improve ISLR.

On the other hand, this algorithm obtains extra coding gain by using a stricter judgment condition. Finally, we apply our algorithm to the parallel decoding structure.

With more portable devices supplied by energy-limited batteries applying CR technology, it needs to design a new scheduling strategy to improve energy efficiency. In this paper, considering frequency switching delay, adaptive power and minimum rate requirements, we formulate the scheduling problem in the centralized time-slotted CRN as a joint channel allocation and power control optimization problem aiming to maximize network energy efficiency. This problem is a mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem which is generally NP-hard. To obtain globe solutions without substantial increase in computational complexity, we develop a scheduling scheme based on particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm which performs channel allocation and adaptive power simultaneously through updating pairs of particles. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can achieve higher energy efficiency and attain a better tradeoff between throughput and energy consumption without violating the minimum rate requirements.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6986237/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 Aug. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"18 December 2014","accessionNumber":"14822788","htmlLink":"/document/6986237/","conferenceDate":"5-8 Aug. 2014","displayDocTitle":"A new energy-efficient scheduling algorithm based on particle swarm optimization for cognitive radio networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new energy-efficient scheduling algorithm based on particle swarm optimization for cognitive radio networks","confLoc":"Guilin, China","sourcePdf":"2010.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069515S","chronDate":"5-8 Aug. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6971897","isNumber":"6986138","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6971897","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6986138","articleId":"6986237","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6986238,"authors":[{"name":"Lei Gao","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Complex Electromagnetic Environment Effects on Electronics and Information System, China"],"firstName":"Lei","lastName":"Gao","id":"37087515652"},{"name":"Yong-hu Zeng","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Complex Electromagnetic Environment Effects on Electronics and Information System, China"],"firstName":"Yong-hu","lastName":"Zeng","id":"37086009942"},{"name":"Lian-dong Wang","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Complex Electromagnetic Environment Effects on Electronics and Information System, China"],"firstName":"Lian-dong","lastName":"Wang","id":"37086331618"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-5274-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-5272-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6986238","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":146},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Arrays","Receiving antennas","Imaging","Antenna arrays","Broadband antennas","Filtering","Synthetic aperture radar"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["airborne radar","antenna arrays","array signal processing","compressed sensing","radar imaging","synthetic aperture radar"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["airborne forward looking SAR","two-dimensional resolution image","antennas","airplane wing","cost reduction","compressed sensing theory","sparse array design method","airborne FL-SAR imaging","data transmission","data storage"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Airborne","Forward Looking SAR","Compressed sensing","Sparse array"]}],"abstract":"In the airborne forward looking SAR (FL-SAR), there were a list of antennas along the wing of airplane, which were used to achieve two-dimensional resolution image of scene front the airplane.

The equivariant adaptive separation via independence (EASI) algorithm is adopted. This blind-source separation (BSS) approach requires no prior information and demands no training sequence. To reduce its complexity, the equation to update the separating matrix is simplified. Furthermore, to achieve the target throughput, a 16-parallel signal processing structure unfolded from the corresponding serial structure which directly implements the simplified algorithm is adopted. Moreover, two modifications including the relaxed look-ahead computation and the slowing down of matrix updating are applied to increase the processing speed and decrease the hardware cost for VLSI implementation. Finally, the whole structure is implemented using Silterra 0.13 um process with a core area of 0.36 mm\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n.","doi":"10.1109/ICSPCC.2014.6986245","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Conference on Signal Processing, Communications and Computing (ICSPCC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Conference on Signal Processing, Communications and Computing (ICSPCC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6971897/6986138/06986245.pdf","startPage":"503","endPage":"508","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSPCC.2014.6986245","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6986138","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 3.52 GSps throughput VLSI architecture of I/Q imbalance compensator for 60 GHz communication system","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6986245","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 Aug. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6986245/","displayDocTitle":"A 3.52 GSps throughput VLSI architecture of I/Q imbalance compensator for 60 GHz communication system","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2014","accessionNumber":"14822745","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6986245/","conferenceDate":"5-8 Aug. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"18 December 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 3.52 GSps throughput VLSI architecture of I/Q imbalance compensator for 60 GHz communication system","confLoc":"Guilin, China","sourcePdf":"2021.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057454S","chronDate":"5-8 Aug. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6971897","isNumber":"6986138","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6971897","xplore-issue":"6986138","articleId":"6986245","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6986247,"authors":[{"name":"Hongyu Zhao","affiliation":["School of electrical and engineering, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, Hunan, CN"],"firstName":"Hongyu","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37085341422"},{"name":"Quang Wang","affiliation":["School of electrical and engineering, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, Hunan, CN"],"firstName":"Quang","lastName":"Wang","id":"37087513867"},{"name":"Qingping Wang","affiliation":["School of electrical and engineering, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, Hunan, CN"],"firstName":"Qingping","lastName":"Wang","id":"37061197200"},{"name":"Weiwei Wu","affiliation":["School of electrical and engineering, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, Hunan, CN"],"firstName":"Weiwei","lastName":"Wu","id":"37085365153"},{"name":"Naichang Yuan","affiliation":["School of electrical and engineering, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, Hunan, CN"],"firstName":"Naichang","lastName":"Yuan","id":"37301781100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-5274-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-5272-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6986247","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":83},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Information filters","Speckle","Filtering algorithms","Noise reduction","Noise","Synthetic aperture radar"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image enhancement","radar imaging","speckle","synthetic aperture radar"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["SAR image despeckling","adaptive neighborhood window","rotationally invariant block matching","speckle reduction algorithm","synthetic aperture radar image","rectangle neighborhood window","speckle suppression","visual quality"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["synthetic aperture radar","speckle suppression","adaptive neighborhood window","rotationally invariant block matching (RIBM)","non-local means (NL-means)"]}],"abstract":"This paper proposes a new speckle reduction algorithm for synthetic aperture radar images; it is based on the adaptive neighborhood window (ANW) and rotationally invariant block matching (RIBM).

It is noticed that only the robustness in presence of micrpohone gain and phase errors is discussed, and the case with microphone position errors has not been studied yet. To bridge this lecture gap, the main objective in this work is studying the design procedure against the uniformly distributed microphone position mismatches with passband shaping characteristics.

Generally sparsity is used as a prior knowledge to improve the quality of reconstructed image. In this paper, we propose an effective compressed sensing rapid MR imaging method incorporating Non-Subsampled Shearlet transform (NSST) sparsity prior information for MR image reconstruction from highly undersampled k-space data. In particular, we have implemented the more flexible decomposition with 2n directional subbands at each scale using NSST to obtain the prominent sparser representation for MR images. In addition, the mixed L1-L2 norm of the coefficients from the prior component and residual component is used to enforce joint sparsity. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can significantly increase signal sparsity and improve the ill-conditioning of MR imaging system using NSST sparsity regularization. The evaluations on a T2-weighted brain image and a MR phantom experiment demonstrate superior performance of the proposed method in terms of reconstruction error reduction, detail preservation and aliasing, Gibbs ringing artifacts suppression compared to state-of-the-art technique. Its performance in objective evaluation indices outperforms conventional CS-MRI methods prominently.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Compressed sensing undersampled MRI reconstruction using iterative shrinkage thresholding based on NSST","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Conference on Signal Processing, Communications and Computing (ICSPCC)","doi":"10.1109/ICSPCC.2014.6986275","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Conference on Signal Processing, Communications and Computing (ICSPCC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6971897/6986138/06986275.pdf","startPage":"653","endPage":"658","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSPCC.2014.6986275","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6986138","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6986275","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6986275/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 Aug. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Compressed sensing undersampled MRI reconstruction using iterative shrinkage thresholding based on NSST","conferenceDate":"5-8 Aug. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6986275/","dateOfInsertion":"18 December 2014","publicationDate":"Aug. 2014","accessionNumber":"14822862","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Compressed sensing undersampled MRI reconstruction using iterative shrinkage thresholding based on NSST","confLoc":"Guilin, China","sourcePdf":"2081.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.084026S","chronDate":"5-8 Aug. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6971897","isNumber":"6986138","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6971897","xplore-issue":"6986138","articleId":"6986275","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":6986281,"authors":[{"name":"Chen Shen","affiliation":["Hefei Normal University, Anhui Provincial Key Science Foundation for Outstanding Young Talent under Grant.

Moreover, we provide the conditions that guarantee the exact DOA estimation using one snapshot, including the theoretical low-bound of the required number of sensors and the minimum angle-distance between two consecutive sources.

TomoSAR using multiple baselines to form an elevation synthetic aperture which has the capability to retrieve the structural information of the observed objects. However, its image quality is limited by the distribution and extent of the baselines. Compressive sensing provides super resolution power and allows to recover details not accessible otherwise. Since the structure of a boreal forest appears at two layers at P-band, compressive sensing method can be used to retrieve the height. In this paper we introduce a compressive sensing based method to retrieve height of the boreal forest within the Krycklan River catchment, Northern Sweden, investigated at P-band during the ESA campaign BioSAR 2008. Because compressive sensing occasionally causes outliers and slightly underestimates the amplitudes, a two-step post-processing method is followed. The experiment results verify the performance of the proposed method for retrieving the boreal forest height.","doi":"10.1109/ICSPCC.2014.6986324","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Conference on Signal Processing, Communications and Computing (ICSPCC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Conference on Signal Processing, Communications and Computing (ICSPCC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6971897/6986138/06986324.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSPCC.2014.6986324","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6986138","startPage":"882","endPage":"885","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"SAR tomography for forest height retrieval based on compressive sensing and post-processing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6986324","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"SAR tomography for forest height retrieval based on compressive sensing and post-processing","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 Aug. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6986324/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"5-8 Aug. 2014","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2014","accessionNumber":"14822709","dateOfInsertion":"18 December 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6986324/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SAR tomography for forest height retrieval based on compressive sensing and post-processing","confLoc":"Guilin, China","sourcePdf":"2154.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062919S","chronDate":"5-8 Aug. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6971897","isNumber":"6986138","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6971897","xplore-issue":"6986138","articleId":"6986324","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":6986326,"authors":[{"name":"Lingling Lao","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Information, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Lingling","lastName":"Lao","id":"37085422198"},{"name":"Lixin Li","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Information, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Lixin","lastName":"Li","id":"37406680100"},{"name":"Meng Zhu","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Information, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Meng","lastName":"Zhu","id":"37072066000"},{"name":"Huisheng Zhang","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Information, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Huisheng","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37406813500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-5274-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-5272-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6986326","dbTime":"17 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":264},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decoding","Parity check codes","Algorithm design and analysis","Complexity theory","Throughput","Equations","Quantization (signal)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","convergence","decoding","Long Term Evolution","message passing","parity check codes","quantisation (signal)","turbo codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["turbo-decoding message-passing algorithm","LDPC","low-density parity-check codes","LTE channel","TDMP","convergence speed","hardware implementation complexity","storage unit restriction","integer quantization operations","computation complexity","decoder throughput"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Low-Density Parity-Check (LDPC)","Turbo-decoding Message-passing (TDMP)","decoder architecture"]}],"abstract":"The Turbo-decoding Message-passing (TDMP) algorithm of Low-Density Parity-Check (LDPC) codes has a faster convergence speed, lower hardware implementation complexity, and less storage units than the Belief-Passing (BP) algorithms.

Recently, a differential solution has been proposed for SM, which dispenses with channel estimation and restricts the signal-to-noise (SNR) loss to a relatively low level under quasi-static channel conditions. Hence, the application of differential SM (DSM) to OFDM UWA communications is of particular interest.

Backscatter radio is a communication scheme that can accommodate for these two constraints, as opposed to active radio architectures. For large scale applications, backscatter communication range extension is a necessity; for this, careful tag design has to be employed, in order to minimize the tag information bit-error-rate (BER) at the reader. Conventional backscatter radio/RFID load modulators achieve reflection coefficients whose magnitude is less than unity; thus, the reflection coefficients' difference magnitude-which is directly related to the backscatter signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)-is upper bounded by |\u0394\u0393| \u2264 2. This is a limitation for SNR maximization, and alternative system architectures have to be exploited for load modulators. In this work, an architecture is presented that overcomes this limitation with the use of a low-power reflection amplifier, which shows a reflection coefficient greater than unity on its port. The amplify-and-reflect system proposed can be utilized to significantly increase the SNR of the backscattered signals and the uplink range of RF tags.","doi":"10.1109/EuMC.2014.6986355","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EuMC.2014.6986355","startPage":"5","endPage":"8","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 44th European Microwave Conference","pdfPath":"/iel7/6971859/6986339/06986355.pdf","publicationTitle":"2014 44th European Microwave Conference","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6986339","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Inkjet-printed reflection amplifier for increased-range Backscatter radio","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-9 Oct. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Inkjet-printed reflection amplifier for increased-range Backscatter radio","conferenceDate":"6-9 Oct. 2014","publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"18 December 2014","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"14821248","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6986355/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Inkjet-printed reflection amplifier for increased-range Backscatter radio","confLoc":"Rome, Italy","sourcePdf":"2014.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039002S","chronDate":"6-9 Oct. 2014","isNumber":"6986339","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6971859","citationCount":"4","articleId":"6986355","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6986356,"authors":[{"name":"W.

To the author's best knowledge the achieved performance of the designed transformer is better than so far published state of the art results.","doi":"10.1109/EuMC.2014.6986363","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EuMC.2014.6986363","startPage":"37","endPage":"40","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 44th European Microwave Conference","pdfPath":"/iel7/6971859/6986339/06986363.pdf","publicationTitle":"2014 44th European Microwave Conference","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6986339","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Broadside-coupled multi-octave impedance transformer","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"6-9 Oct. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Broadside-coupled multi-octave impedance transformer","conferenceDate":"6-9 Oct. 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"18 December 2014","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6986363/","accessionNumber":"14821200","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6986363/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Broadside-coupled multi-octave impedance transformer","confLoc":"Rome, Italy","sourcePdf":"2105.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065156S","chronDate":"6-9 Oct. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6971859","isNumber":"6986339","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6971859","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6986339","articleId":"6986363","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"European Microwave Association","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6986371,"authors":[{"name":"Artur Nalobin","affiliation":["Institute of Microwave Systems, Ruhr-Universit\u00e4t Bochum, Bochum, Germany"],"firstName":"Artur","lastName":"Nalobin","id":"37085419081"},{"name":"Ilona Rolfes","affiliation":["Institute of Microwave Systems, Ruhr-Universit\u00e4t Bochum, Bochum, Germany"],"firstName":"Ilona","lastName":"Rolfes","id":"37085409772"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-2-8748-7035-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6986371","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":196},"abstract":"This contribution deals with the direction-of-arrival estimation of narrowband signals in near-field scenarios using compressed sensing strategies.

These open resonators are electrically small planar elements useful for the implementation of shunt LC resonators in microstrip or coplanar waveguide technology. However, their synthesis is in general complex and requires the experience of the microwave engineers. To solve this limitation, and to ease any design process involving OCSRRs, we have developed an efficient iterative synthesis tool based on ASM, able to provide the physical dimensions of the resonator from the required reactive elements (given by specifications) and substrate parameters. As an example of application, the tool is used for the synthesis and design of a planar wideband bandpass filter based on OCSRRs coupled through admittance inverters. Due to the inherent transmission zeros associated to the OCSRRs, these filters exhibit good stop band performance, with high selectivity at the upper transition band.","doi":"10.1109/EuMC.2014.6986435","publicationTitle":"2014 44th European Microwave Conference","startPage":"323","endPage":"326","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EuMC.2014.6986435","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6986339","pdfPath":"/iel7/6971859/6986339/06986435.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 44th European Microwave Conference","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Band-pass filters","Integrated circuit modeling","Microstrip filters","Resonator filters","Optical ring resonators","Layout","Microwave filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["band-pass filters","LC circuits","network synthesis","resonators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automated synthesis","open complementary split ring resonators","OCSRR","aggressive space mapping","ASM","electrically small planar elements","shunt LC resonators","microstrip waveguide technology","coplanar waveguide technology","microwave engineers","iterative synthesis tool","reactive elements","substrate parameters","planar wideband bandpass filter","admittance inverters","transmission zeros"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["aggressive space mapping","automated circuit synthesis","split ring resonators (SRRs)","planar filters"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Synthesis of open complementary split ring resonators (OCSRRs) through aggressive space mapping (ASM) and application to bandpass filters","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6986435/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6986435/","accessionNumber":"14821308","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"18 December 2014","publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","conferenceDate":"6-9 Oct. 2014","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"6-9 Oct. 2014","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Synthesis of open complementary split ring resonators (OCSRRs) through aggressive space mapping (ASM) and application to bandpass filters","confLoc":"Rome, Italy","sourcePdf":"1373.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040269S","chronDate":"6-9 Oct. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6971859","isNumber":"6986339","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6971859","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6986339","articleId":"6986435","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"European Microwave Association","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6986447,"authors":[{"name":"Omid Habibpour","affiliation":["Microtechnology and Nanoscience Department, Chalmers University of Technology, Gothenburg, Sweden"],"firstName":"Omid","lastName":"Habibpour","id":"37427469200"},{"name":"Michael Winters","affiliation":["Microtechnology and Nanoscience Department, Chalmers University of Technology, Gothenburg, Sweden"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Winters","id":"37085518918"},{"name":"Niklas Rorsman","affiliation":["Microtechnology and Nanoscience Department, Chalmers University of Technology, Gothenburg, Sweden"],"firstName":"Niklas","lastName":"Rorsman","id":"37282685200"},{"name":"Herbert Zirath","affiliation":["Microtechnology and Nanoscience Department, Chalmers University of Technology, Gothenburg, Sweden"],"firstName":"Herbert","lastName":"Zirath","id":"37275066000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-2-8748-7035-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6986447","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":304},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6986447","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Graphene","Gain","Broadband amplifiers","Field effect transistors","Logic gates","Transconductance","Resists"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field effect transistors","graphene devices","microwave amplifiers","wideband amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["graphene field effect transistors","G-FET based wideband amplifiers"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Graphene FET","power gain","hydrogen intercalated graphene","wideband amplifiers"]}],"abstract":"We demonstrate graphene field of transistors (G-FETs) providing power gain of > 7 dB in a 50 O system.

The approach has been successfully tested with a GaN PA using LTE signals, showing a reduction of over 17 dB in the adjacent channel power ratio and a better in-band equalization compared with a conventional time-domain DPD. As M-ary quadrature amplitude modulated symbols can be directly pipelined into the OFDM transmission framework, the running complexity of proposed structure offers a saving of about four times the floating point operations (FLOPs) compared to time-domain DPDs, with the added value of using only the channel bandwidth for the predistorted signal generation.","doi":"10.1109/EuMC.2014.6986563","publicationTitle":"2014 44th European Microwave Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 44th European Microwave Conference","pdfPath":"/iel7/6971859/6986339/06986563.pdf","startPage":"829","endPage":"832","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EuMC.2014.6986563","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6986339","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Volterra-Parafac digital predistorter for OFDM Wireless Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6986563","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-9 Oct. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6986563/","displayDocTitle":"Volterra-Parafac digital predistorter for OFDM Wireless Systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","accessionNumber":"14821305","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6986563/","conferenceDate":"6-9 Oct. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"18 December 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Volterra-Parafac digital predistorter for OFDM Wireless Systems","confLoc":"Rome, Italy","sourcePdf":"1639.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059237S","chronDate":"6-9 Oct. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6971859","isNumber":"6986339","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6971859","xplore-issue":"6986339","articleId":"6986563","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"European Microwave Association","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6986564,"authors":[{"name":"Efrain Zenteno","affiliation":["Dept.

We have designed digital predistorters for a MIMO amplifier using a basis pursuit method for reducing model complexity. This method reduces the numerical problems that appear in MIMO Volterra predistorters due to the large number of basis functions. The number of basis functions was reduced from 1402 to 220 in a 2\u00d72 MIMO amplifier and from 127 to 13 in the corresponding SISO case. Reducing the number of basis functions caused an increase of approximately 1 dB of model error and adjacent channel power ratio.","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 44th European Microwave Conference","pdfPath":"/iel7/6971859/6986339/06986564.pdf","startPage":"833","endPage":"836","publicationTitle":"2014 44th European Microwave Conference","doi":"10.1109/EuMC.2014.6986564","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EuMC.2014.6986564","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6986339","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6986564","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Combating the dimensionality of nonlinear MIMO amplifier predistortion by basis pursuit","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Computational modeling","Predistortion","Numerical models","Estimation","Microwave theory and techniques","Nonlinear dynamical systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplifiers","MIMO systems","nonlinear dynamical systems","Volterra series"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO Volterra predistorters","SISO systems","Volterra series","nonlinear dynamic MIMO systems","basis pursuit","MIMO amplifier predistortion"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Digital pre distortion (DPD)","MIMO power amplifiers","LASSO","basis pursuit","power amplifier linearization"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6986564/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-9 Oct. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Combating the dimensionality of nonlinear MIMO amplifier predistortion by basis pursuit","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6986564/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","accessionNumber":"14821259","dateOfInsertion":"18 December 2014","conferenceDate":"6-9 Oct. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Combating the dimensionality of nonlinear MIMO amplifier predistortion by basis pursuit","confLoc":"Rome, Italy","sourcePdf":"1847.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058175S","chronDate":"6-9 Oct. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6971859","isNumber":"6986339","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6971859","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"6986339","articleId":"6986564","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"European Microwave Association","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":6986565,"authors":[{"name":"Amadou Mbaye","affiliation":["ESYCOM, Universit\u00e9 Paris-Est, Noisy-le-grand, cedex, France"],"firstName":"Amadou","lastName":"Mbaye","id":"38467643600"},{"name":"Genevi\u00e8ve Baudoin","affiliation":["ESYCOM, Universit\u00e9 Paris-Est, Noisy-le-grand, cedex, France"],"firstName":"Genevi\u00e8ve","lastName":"Baudoin","id":"37277494700"},{"name":"Abel Gouba","affiliation":["SUPELEC, Cesson-Sevign\u00e9, cedex, France"],"firstName":"Abel","lastName":"Gouba","id":"37085415071"},{"name":"Yves Louet","affiliation":["SUPELEC, Cesson-Sevign\u00e9, cedex, France"],"firstName":"Yves","lastName":"Louet","id":"37571400800"},{"name":"Martine Villegas","affiliation":["ESYCOM, Universit\u00e9 Paris-Est, Noisy-le-grand, cedex, France"],"firstName":"Martine","lastName":"Villegas","id":"37277516900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-2-8748-7035-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6986565","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":643},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Peak to average power ratio","Power amplifiers","Gain","Radio frequency","Mathematical model","Polynomials"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplification","limiters","optimisation","radiofrequency power amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["crest factor reduction","digital predistortion","automatic determination","radio frequency power amplifiers","peak to average power ratio reduction gain","power efficiency","amplification module"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6986565","abstract":"Digital predistortion (DPD) and Crest Factor Reduction (CFR) are applied separately in radio frequency power amplifiers (PAs) in general. This paper proposes a method to jointly optimize DPD and CFR. For a given model of predistorter our solution gives automatically the Peak to average power ratio (PAPR) reduction gain to be applied by the CFR module. Within the DPD module PAPRs of original input signal and PA output and PAPR at predistorter output without CFR are used to estimate an optimal CFR gain through mathematical calculations. The combined CFR/DPD module ensures that the PAPR at the output of predistorter will not exceed a given limit. Hence, the envelope clipping module which is typically present to protect the PA, may be removed. In addition the proposed method offers a higher operating range of the DPD while fulfilling out-of band requirements and preserving low in-band distortion. Power efficiency of amplification module is improved as well. This solution has been tested by simulation and on a class AB LDMOS power amplifier in Agilent Advanced Design System (ADS).","doi":"10.1109/EuMC.2014.6986565","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EuMC.2014.6986565","startPage":"837","endPage":"840","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 44th European Microwave Conference","pdfPath":"/iel7/6971859/6986339/06986565.pdf","publicationTitle":"2014 44th European Microwave Conference","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6986339","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Combining Crest Factor Reduction and digital predistortion with automatic determination of the necessary Crest Factor Reduction gain","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"6-9 Oct. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Combining Crest Factor Reduction and digital predistortion with automatic determination of the necessary Crest Factor Reduction gain","conferenceDate":"6-9 Oct. 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"18 December 2014","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6986565/","accessionNumber":"14821383","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6986565/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Combining Crest Factor Reduction and digital predistortion with automatic determination of the necessary Crest Factor Reduction gain","confLoc":"Rome, Italy","sourcePdf":"1405.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.136504S","chronDate":"6-9 Oct. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6971859","isNumber":"6986339","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6971859","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6986339","articleId":"6986565","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"European Microwave Association","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6986569,"authors":[{"name":"Morteza Rezaee","affiliation":["Communications and Computer Research Center, Ferdowsi University of Mashhad, Mashhad, Iran"],"firstName":"Morteza","lastName":"Rezaee","id":"37393475500"},{"name":"Amir Reza Attari","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Ferdowsi University of Mashhad, Mashhad, Iran"],"firstName":"Amir Reza","lastName":"Attari","id":"37328940200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-2-8748-7035-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6986569","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":17,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1439},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Band-pass filters","Resonator filters","Dual band","Microwave filters","Couplings","Filtering theory","Cavity resonators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cavity resonators","coupled circuits","frequency response","matrix algebra","substrate integrated waveguides","waveguide filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frequency response","coupling matrix","square SIW cavity","dual mode resonator","transmission zero","substrate integrated waveguide filter","three-cavity dual mode dual band SIW filter"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["dual band filter","dual mode resonator","Substrate Integrated Waveguide (SIW)"]}],"abstract":"In this article, a novel dual mode dual band substrate integrated waveguide (SIW) filter is presented.

Starting from some recent results on the origin of AM/AM and AM/PM distortion in power amplifiers made for these two device types, we demonstrate that there is no fundamental reason why the devices should be different, except that the formers suffer from a noticeable low-frequency dispersion. Then, we dig into this particular aspect of GaN HEMT operation, to show that this charge trapping-related phenomenon is responsible for a severe self-biasing capable of inducing soft-compression of an otherwise almost flat AM/AM gain plot - when measured with static CW tests - which, in fact, corresponds to a severe gain expansion when the AM/AM is assessed with more realistic dynamic tests performed with real communication signals. And it is this class-C PA like AM/AM that is responsible for the recognized GaN HEMT nonlinearity.","doi":"10.1109/EuMC.2014.6986681","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EuMC.2014.6986681","startPage":"1297","endPage":"1300","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 44th European Microwave Conference","pdfPath":"/iel7/6971859/6986339/06986681.pdf","publicationTitle":"2014 44th European Microwave Conference","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6986339","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Soft compression and the origins of nonlinear behavior of GaN HEMTs","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"6-9 Oct. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Soft compression and the origins of nonlinear behavior of GaN HEMTs","conferenceDate":"6-9 Oct. 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"18 December 2014","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6986681/","accessionNumber":"14821115","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6986681/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Soft compression and the origins of nonlinear behavior of GaN HEMTs","confLoc":"Rome, Italy","sourcePdf":"1876.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041634S","chronDate":"6-9 Oct. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6971859","isNumber":"6986339","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6971859","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"6986339","articleId":"6986681","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"European Microwave Association","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6986683,"authors":[{"name":"F.L.

The challenge is the determination of the required baseband signal. In [6] a generalized formulation quantifying the baseband voltage signal, injected at the output bias port, to linearize the device behavior was introduced. This envelope domain based solution requires the determination of only a small number of linearizing coefficients. More importantly these coefficients should be stimulus, hence bandwidth independent. This property has been experimentally investigated using a 10W Cree GaN HEMT device under a 3-tone modulated stimulus at 1.5dB of compression. It will be shown that the linearization coefficients were invariant when varying the modulation bandwidth from 2MHz to 20MHz.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bandwidth","Baseband","Voltage measurement","Modulation","Radio frequency","Current measurement","Microwave amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["gallium compounds","high electron mobility transistors","III-V semiconductors","power amplifiers","wide band gap semiconductors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["modulation bandwidth","3-tone modulated stimulus","Cree GaN HEMT device","baseband signal","power amplifiers linearization","baseband injection","envelope domain","baseband linearization","power 10 W","bandwidth 2 MHz to 20 MHz","GaN"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["bandwidth","modulation","independence","distortion"]}],"doi":"10.1109/EuMC.2014.6986683","publicationTitle":"2014 44th European Microwave Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 44th European Microwave Conference","pdfPath":"/iel7/6971859/6986339/06986683.pdf","startPage":"1305","endPage":"1308","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6986339","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EuMC.2014.6986683","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High bandwidth investigations of a baseband linearization approach formulated in the envelope domain under modulated stimulus","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6986683","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"High bandwidth investigations of a baseband linearization approach formulated in the envelope domain under modulated stimulus","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6986683/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6986683/","accessionNumber":"14821196","conferenceDate":"6-9 Oct. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"18 December 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-9 Oct. 2014","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High bandwidth investigations of a baseband linearization approach formulated in the envelope domain under modulated stimulus","confLoc":"Rome, Italy","sourcePdf":"1155.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055471S","chronDate":"6-9 Oct. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6971859","isNumber":"6986339","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6971859","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6986339","articleId":"6986683","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"European Microwave Association","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":6986686,"authors":[{"name":"Rached Hajji","affiliation":["TRIQUINT SEMICONDUCTOR Inc., Richardson, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Rached","lastName":"Hajji","id":"37275058900"},{"name":"Matthew Poulton","affiliation":["TRIQUINT SEMICONDUCTOR Inc., Richardson, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Matthew","lastName":"Poulton","id":"37294000000"},{"name":"D.

presents a wideband envelope amplifier for envelope-tracking operation of handset power amplifiers. The amplifier has a combined structure composed of a linear regulator and a switching converter. A low output impedance class-AB push-pull output stage is employed to expand the bandwidth (BW) of the linear regulator. By reducing the output resistance of the source follower using dual shunt feedbacks, a nondominant pole at the gate of the output buffer is pushed to the higher frequency range. The gain BW product (GBW) of the linear regulator is improved without sacrificing the phase margin (PM) and efficiency. The designed linear regulator achieves the GBW of 129.6-MHz and PM of 73.1 \u00b0. For a 40-MHz long term evolution signal having a peak-to-average power ratio of 7.4 dB, the envelope amplifier delivers an efficiency of 73.6% at the peak power driving a 7.7\u03a9 resistive load.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Regulators","Impedance","Resistance","Wideband","Switching converters","Gain","Peak to average power ratio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["radiofrequency power amplifiers","switching convertors","VHF amplifiers","wideband amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["phase margin","GBW","gain BW product","nondominant pole","dual shunt feedbacks","source follower","low output impedance class-AB push-pull output stage","switching converter","linear regulator","handset power amplifiers","envelope-tracking operation","wideband envelope amplifier","frequency 129.6 MHz","frequency 40 MHz","efficiency 73.6 percent","resistance 7.7 ohm"]}],"doi":"10.1109/EuMC.2014.6986695","publicationTitle":"2014 44th European Microwave Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 44th European Microwave Conference","pdfPath":"/iel7/6971859/6986339/06986695.pdf","startPage":"1352","endPage":"1355","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6986339","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EuMC.2014.6986695","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Wideband envelope amplifier for envelope-tracking operation of handset power amplifier","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6986695","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Wideband envelope amplifier for envelope-tracking operation of handset power amplifier","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6986695/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6986695/","accessionNumber":"14821509","conferenceDate":"6-9 Oct. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"18 December 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-9 Oct. 2014","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wideband envelope amplifier for envelope-tracking operation of handset power amplifier","confLoc":"Rome, Italy","sourcePdf":"1071.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054453S","chronDate":"6-9 Oct. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6971859","isNumber":"6986339","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6971859","xplore-issue":"6986339","articleId":"6986695","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"European Microwave Association","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6986696,"authors":[{"name":"Konstantinos Mimis","affiliation":["Toshiba Research Europe Limited, Bristol, United Kingdom"],"firstName":"Konstantinos","lastName":"Mimis","id":"37855575900"},{"name":"Gavin T.

A reactively load-modulated low-power GaAs E-pHEMT amplifier is used, operating at 2.3GHz with 20dBm peak output power. The amplifier is first characterised under CW operation and the appropriate functions for maximising PAE are extracted. These are then used to enhance the efficiency of the amplifier under modulated signals. Using multi-tone, as well as, 1.4 and 3MHz LTE signals, the effects of time misalignment between the two paths on output power; PAE and spectral regrowth are explored. As expected, proper alignment of the signals is crucial, but it is shown especially important for minimising ACPR asymmetry, similar to supply modulation architectures. This highlights the underlying trade-off between synchronisation accuracy and linearisation effort requirement.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6986696/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-9 Oct. 2014","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"6-9 Oct. 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6986696/","dateOfInsertion":"18 December 2014","publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","accessionNumber":"14821213","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Experimental investigation of signal time misalignment in dynamic load modulation amplifiers","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Experimental investigation of signal time misalignment in dynamic load modulation amplifiers","confLoc":"Rome, Italy","sourcePdf":"1116.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045222S","chronDate":"6-9 Oct. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6971859","isNumber":"6986339","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6971859","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6986339","articleId":"6986696","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"European Microwave Association","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6986698,"authors":[{"name":"Daniel Markert","affiliation":["Bell Labs, Alcatel-Lucent Deutschland AG, Stuttgart"],"firstName":"Daniel","lastName":"Markert","id":"38528419100"},{"name":"Christoph Haslach","affiliation":["Bell Labs, Alcatel-Lucent Deutschland AG, Stuttgart"],"firstName":"Christoph","lastName":"Haslach","id":"38181026500"},{"name":"Holger Heimpel","affiliation":["Bell Labs, Alcatel-Lucent Deutschland AG, Stuttgart"],"firstName":"Holger","lastName":"Heimpel","id":"37698132500"},{"name":"Andreas Pascht","affiliation":["Bell Labs, Alcatel-Lucent Deutschland AG, Stuttgart"],"firstName":"Andreas","lastName":"Pascht","id":"37278365500"},{"name":"Georg Fischer","affiliation":["University Erlangen-Nuremberg, Institute for Electronics Engineering, Erlangen"],"firstName":"Georg","lastName":"Fischer","id":"37288289900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-2-8748-7035-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6986698","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":184},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Clocks","Switches","Encoding","Noise","Pulse width modulation","Peak to average power ratio","Phase modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["delta-sigma modulation","field programmable gate arrays","phase modulation","power amplifiers","pulse width modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["phase modulated DSM-PWM hybrids","pulse length restriction","switch mode power amplifiers","amplitude information encoding","phase information encoding","binary waveforms","phase modulated delta-sigma modulation","pulse width modulation","signal generation","mobile communication signals","FPGA"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["mobile communications","power amplifier","pulse-width modulation","signal processing","switch-mode","transmitter","delta-sigma modulation","Class-S"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6986698","abstract":"This paper describes a novel concept to encode amplitude and phase information in binary waveforms for switch-mode power amplifiers (SMPAs). A combination of a phase-modulated delta-sigma modulation (DSM) and pulse-width modulation (PWM) makes it possible to adapt signal generation to the power amplifier limits. The proposed system overcomes the inherent signal quality limits of digital systems with fixed clock frequencies by applying a phase modulated clock. We demonstrate that it is possible to achieve the performance of conventional concepts at less than half of the bit rate. Simulation and measurement results are given for important figures of merit of mobile communication signals with high peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR).

At the 6-dB back-off power level, the DC power dissipation is reduced by 45% compared to a class-A linear PA.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6986701/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-9 Oct. 2014","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"6-9 Oct. 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6986701/","dateOfInsertion":"18 December 2014","publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","accessionNumber":"14821517","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A K-band power amplifier with adaptive bias in 90-nm CMOS","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A K-band power amplifier with adaptive bias in 90-nm CMOS","confLoc":"Rome, Italy","sourcePdf":"1365.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043046S","chronDate":"6-9 Oct. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6971859","isNumber":"6986339","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6971859","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6986339","articleId":"6986701","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"European Microwave Association","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6986702,"authors":[{"name":"Yunsung Cho","affiliation":["Division of IT Convergence Engineering, Pohang University of Science and Technology, Pohang, Gyeungbuk, Republic of Korea"],"firstName":"Yunsung","lastName":"Cho","id":"37535779200"},{"name":"Byungjoon Park","affiliation":["Division of IT Convergence Engineering, Pohang University of Science and Technology, Pohang, Gyeungbuk, Republic of Korea"],"firstName":"Byungjoon","lastName":"Park","id":"37962809500"},{"name":"Sangsu Jin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Pohang University of Science and Technology, Pohang, Gyeungbuk, Republic of Korea"],"firstName":"Sangsu","lastName":"Jin","id":"37065027200"},{"name":"Jooseung Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Pohang University of Science and Technology, Pohang, Gyeungbuk, Republic of Korea"],"firstName":"Jooseung","lastName":"Kim","id":"37539891000"},{"name":"Kyunghoon Moon","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Pohang University of Science and Technology, Pohang, Gyeungbuk, Republic of Korea"],"firstName":"Kyunghoon","lastName":"Moon","id":"37075584700"},{"name":"Daehyun Kang","affiliation":["Broadcom Corporation, Matawan, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Daehyun","lastName":"Kang","id":"37289143600"},{"name":"Hadong Jin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Pohang University of Science and Technology, Pohang, Gyeungbuk, Republic of Korea"],"firstName":"Hadong","lastName":"Jin","id":"38467749200"},{"name":"Seungbeom Koo","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Pohang University of Science and Technology, Pohang, Gyeungbuk, Republic of Korea"],"firstName":"Seungbeom","lastName":"Koo","id":"37085431676"},{"name":"Bumman Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Pohang University of Science and Technology, Pohang, Gyeungbuk, Republic of Korea"],"firstName":"Bumman","lastName":"Kim","id":"37276226900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-2-8748-7035-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6986702","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":271},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["CMOS integrated circuits","Gain","Power generation","Frequency measurement","Switches","Harmonic analysis","Peak to average power ratio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS integrated circuits","Long Term Evolution","low-power electronics","network topology","transformers","transmission lines","UHF power amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dual power mode CMOS power amplifier","handset applications","fully integrated transformer","circuit topology","transmission line transformer","low power mode","long-term evolution signals","frequency 1.7 GHz to 2.0 GHz","voltage 3.5 V","gain 14.5 dB to 16.2 dB"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6986702","doi":"10.1109/EuMC.2014.6986702","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EuMC.2014.6986702","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6986339","publicationTitle":"2014 44th European Microwave Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 44th European Microwave Conference","pdfPath":"/iel7/6971859/6986339/06986702.pdf","startPage":"1380","endPage":"1383","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Transformer based dual-power-mode CMOS power amplifier for handset applications","abstract":"A fully integrated transformer based dual-power-mode CMOS power amplifier (PA) is implemented.

The amplifiers are tested non-destructively, which enables selection based on cryogenic noise and gain; this is crucial for the development of highly-integrated miniaturized receivers for focal plane arrays, such as those used for the measurement of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) polarization and future arrays aimed at probing the epoch of reionization (EoR).","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6986339","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EuMC.2014.6986739","publicationTitle":"2014 44th European Microwave Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 44th European Microwave Conference","pdfPath":"/iel7/6971859/6986339/06986739.pdf","startPage":"1524","endPage":"1527","doi":"10.1109/EuMC.2014.6986739","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cryogenic probing of mm-wave MMIC LNAs for large focal-plane arrays in radio-astronomy","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-9 Oct. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Cryogenic probing of mm-wave MMIC LNAs for large focal-plane arrays in radio-astronomy","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"6-9 Oct. 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6986739/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","accessionNumber":"14821446","dateOfInsertion":"18 December 2014","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6986739/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cryogenic probing of mm-wave MMIC LNAs for large focal-plane arrays in radio-astronomy","confLoc":"Rome, Italy","sourcePdf":"1476.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.128007S","chronDate":"6-9 Oct. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6971859","isNumber":"6986339","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6971859","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6986339","articleId":"6986739","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"European Microwave Association","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6986749,"authors":[{"name":"W.

With the market introduction of the 2014 Mercedes-Benz S-Class vehicle equipped with six radar sensors covering the vehicles environment 360\u00b0 in the near and far range, autonomous driving has become a reality even in low speed highway scenarios. This paves the way for a fast evolution of highly automated driving that also will extend to rural and urban traffic situations. One big straight ahead was made in August 2013. A Mercedes-Benz S-Class vehicle - Mercedes-internally called \u201cBertha\u201d- drove completely autonomously for about 100 km from Mannheim to Pforzheim, Germany. It followed the well-known historic Bertha Benz Memorial Route. This was done on the basis of one stereo vision system, eight serial radar sensors and a huge amount of radar based innovative perception algorithms. These new algorithms taking into account that urban scenarios are characterized by dramatic shorter reaction and observation times, shorter mean free distances, a 360\u00b0 interaction zone and a large variety of object types to be considered. Automotive radar has been the backbone of driver assistance systems and the innovation driver in this field. The question which came up was, will it be able to meet the requirements of eruptive innovations like autonomous driving. The article describes the main challenges, which Daimler radar researches had to face and their solutions to make Bertha see. It will also outline the remaining challenges for radar research and product development.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"6-9 Oct. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6986787/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"14821506","publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","conferenceDate":"6-9 Oct. 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6986787/","dateOfInsertion":"18 December 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Radar contribution to highly automated driving","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Radar contribution to highly automated driving","confLoc":"Rome, Italy","sourcePdf":"1758.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057729S","chronDate":"6-9 Oct. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6971859","isNumber":"6986339","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6971859","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6986339","articleId":"6986787","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"European Microwave Association","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6986788,"authors":[{"name":"Christian Waldschmidt","affiliation":["Institute of Microwave Techniques, University of Ulm, Germany"],"firstName":"Christian","lastName":"Waldschmidt","id":"38226567100"},{"name":"Holger Meinel","affiliation":["Technology Management and Research Policy, Daimler AG, Germany"],"firstName":"Holger","lastName":"Meinel","id":"37301299900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-2-8748-7035-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6986788","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":425},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6986788","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Automotive engineering","Sensors","Radar antennas","Radar applications","Synthetic aperture radar","Conferences"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["road vehicle radar"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["autonomous driving","radar sensors","automotive radar"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["automotive radar","autonomous driving"]}],"doi":"10.1109/EuMC.2014.6986788","publicationTitle":"2014 44th European Microwave Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 44th European Microwave Conference","pdfPath":"/iel7/6971859/6986339/06986788.pdf","startPage":"1719","endPage":"1722","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EuMC.2014.6986788","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6986339","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Future trends and directions in radar concerning the application for autonomous driving","abstract":"The top down approach to derive requirements for future radar sensors for autonomous driving is due to its complexity hardly possible.

Some waveforms are developed intentionally to make their interception almost impossible or jamming resistant. The main distinctive features of radar signal are hidden in its intra-pulse structure. The intra-pulse modulation analysis of a detected signal is the major task of ELINT/ESM systems, too. As a result of measurement, for each pulse specific description, so called finger printing, containing primary parameters, is created. Determination and decomposition of signal in case of M-ary Frequency Shift Keying intra-pulse modulation (M-FSKIM) in the recent hardware implementation of ELINT receivers is difficult to achieve. In this paper, the principle of unknown radar signals with M-FSKIM decomposition by new approach in signal analysis is described. The proposed method is based on subspectral decomposition method. The subspectral decomposition method principle and results of modeling and simulation of M-FSKIM signal processing and decomposition are presented.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6986339","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EuMC.2014.6986818","publicationTitle":"2014 44th European Microwave Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 44th European Microwave Conference","pdfPath":"/iel7/6971859/6986339/06986818.pdf","startPage":"1840","endPage":"1843","doi":"10.1109/EuMC.2014.6986818","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Subspectral method in M-FSK signal processing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-9 Oct. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Subspectral method in M-FSK signal processing","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"6-9 Oct. 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6986818/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","accessionNumber":"14821148","dateOfInsertion":"18 December 2014","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6986818/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Subspectral method in M-FSK signal processing","confLoc":"Rome, Italy","sourcePdf":"1499.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046366S","chronDate":"6-9 Oct. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6971859","isNumber":"6986339","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6971859","xplore-issue":"6986339","articleId":"6986818","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"European Microwave Association","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6986835,"authors":[{"name":"Andrea Bentini","affiliation":["Hardware Development \u2014 Microwaves and Antennas, Elettronica S.p.A., Rome, Italy"],"firstName":"Andrea","lastName":"Bentini","id":"37586594600"},{"name":"Mauro Ferrari","affiliation":["Hardware Development \u2014 Microwaves and Antennas, Elettronica S.p.A., Rome, Italy"],"firstName":"Mauro","lastName":"Ferrari","id":"37592035700"},{"name":"Patrick E.

This latter is able to discern between interfering noise signals and the reference speech signal, hence it can be consider as a necessary preprocessing step. The main problem of the proposed approach lies in the not removable ambiguities typically of the BSS algorithms. In order to overcome to this drawback, a geometrical constraint is also added to the learning algorithm. A practical example shows the effectiveness of the proposed approach in terms of recognition accuracy.","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 International Carnahan Conference on Security Technology

primitives to overcome the susceptibility of secret keys to physical attacks. Recent experiments demonstrated that even some MemPUFs can be physically attacked by exploiting their side-channel information. In this paper, we formulate an adversary model for a prediction attack that takes advantage of the side-channel information leaked from a MemPUF. Based on this pivotal insight, we propose countermeasures to enhance the resilience of MemPUFs against such a kind of attack, and introduce a security-enhanced MemPUF design using phase change material. Our analysis demonstrated the effectiveness of our proposed scheme against the measurement-prediction attack given an adversary with certain bounded attack capability.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Oct. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6987047/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6987047/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"14820425","conferenceDate":"13-16 Oct. 2014","publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"18 December 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Leakage-resilient memory-based physical unclonable function using phase change material","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Leakage-resilient memory-based physical unclonable function using phase change material","confLoc":"Rome, Italy","sourcePdf":"85paper81.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067304S","chronDate":"13-16 Oct. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6961037","isNumber":"6986962","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6961037","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6986962","articleId":"6987047","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":6987059,"authors":[{"name":"Jian Zhao","affiliation":["Photonic Systems Group, Tyndall National Institute, Cork, Ireland"],"firstName":"Jian","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37292066600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7218-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6987059","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":434},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Optical filters","Finite impulse response filters","Optical transmitters","Optical receivers","Optical noise","Optical crosstalk"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discrete Fourier transforms","OFDM modulation","optical crosstalk","optical fibre dispersion","optical fibre networks","optical modulation","quadrature amplitude modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["inter-channel crosstalk","Nyquist FDM","dispersion compensation","OFDM","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","discrete-Fourier-transform","optical domain implementation","optical communication systems","offset quadrature amplitude modulation","offset-QAM multicarrier technology"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Offset quadrature amplitude modulation","Multicarrier","Coherent detection"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we review the multicarrier technology using offset quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) for optical communication systems and networks.

However, these networks require the use of novel software-defined Optical Transceivers that can adapt their features to the channel's requirements. This paper presents a novel optical transceiver architecture using a reconfigurable FEC coding scheme for flexible optical networks. The proposed approach can dynamically support different versions of FEC codes (with different overheads, code lengths, and LLR-widths) based on the network's Quality-of-Service requirements, whereas it can also be applied for the dynamic reconfiguration of the DSP units and the realization of dynamic coded-modulation schemes. The proposed approach has been implemented into an FPGA platform. The performance evaluation shows that the reconfiguration time is always less than 12 ms, which means that the proposed scheme could be utilized in many optical networks, where the reconfiguration time (e.g. for the optical switches or the WSS) is in the order of a few ms.","doi":"10.1109/ICOCN.2014.6987087","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICOCN.2014.6987087","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","publicationTitle":"2014 13th International Conference on Optical Communications and Networks (ICOCN)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 13th International Conference on Optical Communications and Networks (ICOCN)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6971978/6987053/06987087.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6987053","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reconfigurable FEC codes for software-defined optical transceivers","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6987087/","conferenceDate":"9-10 Nov. 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-10 Nov. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Reconfigurable FEC codes for software-defined optical transceivers","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"18 December 2014","accessionNumber":"14822973","publicationDate":"Nov. 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6987087/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reconfigurable FEC codes for software-defined optical transceivers","confLoc":"Suzhou, China","sourcePdf":"M125.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050244S","chronDate":"9-10 Nov. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6971978","isNumber":"6987053","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6971978","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6987053","articleId":"6987087","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6987099,"authors":[{"name":"Xuebing Zhang","affiliation":["Jinan University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, CN"],"firstName":"Xuebing","lastName":"Zhang"},{"name":"Jianping Li","affiliation":["Jinan University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, CN"],"firstName":"Jianping","lastName":"Li"},{"name":"Chao Li","affiliation":["State Key Lab. of Optical Comm.

Both the proposed PBB and conventional pilot-aided (PA) estimation methods are demonstrated in a CO-OFDM transmission experiment, which is modulated by 4 quadrature amplitude modulation (4-QAM) format and transmitted over 1760-km standard single-mode fiber (SSMF). The experimental results show that the proposed PBB method still achieves the similar performance to that of the conventional PA method.","doi":"10.1109/ICOCN.2014.6987099","publicationTitle":"2014 13th International Conference on Optical Communications and Networks (ICOCN)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 13th International Conference on Optical Communications and Networks (ICOCN)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6971978/6987053/06987099.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICOCN.2014.6987099","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6987053","startPage":"1","endPage":"3","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Pilot-based bind phase estimation method for coherent optical OFDM","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6987099","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Pilot-based bind phase estimation method for coherent optical OFDM","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-10 Nov. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6987099/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"9-10 Nov. 2014","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2014","accessionNumber":"14822980","dateOfInsertion":"18 December 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6987099/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Pilot-based bind phase estimation method for coherent optical OFDM","confLoc":"Suzhou, China","sourcePdf":"M222ZhaohuiLi.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067215S","chronDate":"9-10 Nov. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6971978","isNumber":"6987053","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6971978","xplore-issue":"6987053","articleId":"6987099","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":6987101,"authors":[{"name":"Xingwen Yi","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Optical FiberSensing and Communications, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Xingwen","lastName":"Yi","id":"37291184600"},{"name":"Dengke Zeng","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Optical FiberSensing and Communications, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Dengke","lastName":"Zeng","id":"37085437230"},{"name":"Xuemei Chen","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Optical FiberSensing and Communications, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Xuemei","lastName":"Chen","id":"37085430941"},{"name":"Jing Zhang","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Optical FiberSensing and Communications, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Jing","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37061929500"},{"name":"Kun Qiu","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Optical FiberSensing and Communications, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Kun","lastName":"Qiu","id":"37320319600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7218-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6987101","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":110},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Phase noise","OFDM","Laser noise","Optical fibers","Q-factor","Optical noise","Fiber nonlinear optics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["OFDM modulation","optical fibre communication","optical fibre polarisation","optical modulation","optical phase conjugation","phase noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["phase noise tolerance improvement","phase-conjugated OFDM subcarriers","coherent optical OFDM","Hermitan symmetry","single polarization","SP-DCS-OFDM","dual polarizations","laser phase noise","nonlinear phase noise","inter-carrier interference","ICI reduction"]}],"abstract":"We have recently demonstrated the improved phase noise tolerance in coherent optical OFDM by digital coherent superposition of optical OFDM subcarriers, which are phase-conjugated pairs with Hermitan symmetry.

The MIMO VLC system using the popular mobile-phone camera as the optical receiver (Rx) to receive MIMO signal from n \u00d7 n Red-Green-Blue (RGB) LED array is desirable. The key step of decoding the received RGB LED array signals is detecting the direction of received array signals. If the LED transmitter (Tx) is rotated, the signal may not be received correctly and cause an error in the received signal. In this work, we propose and demonstrate a novel hierarchical transmission scheme which can reduce the computation complexity of rotation detection in LED array VLC system.

As the OFDM signal is electronically generated and demodulated by fast Fourier transform (FFT) in the digital domain via electronic digital-to-analog and analog-to-digital converters (DAC/ADC) respectively, the OFDM signal bandwidth is limited by the sampling rate of the DAC/ADC. In this work, we present the feasibility of using all-optical OFDM for the future high-speed PON. All-optical OFDM is another class of optical multiple carrier transmission that relies on all-optically generated or demodulated orthogonal subcarriers. Hence, high data rate can be easily achieved. A 200 Gb/s OFDMA-LR-PON using all-optical OFDM super-channel (SC) is demonstrated. Apart from the optical wired transmission, w-band (100-GHz) millimeter-wave (MMW) wireless transmission is also demonstrated to support the in-building mobile broadband services.","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 13th International Conference on Optical Communications and Networks (ICOCN)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6971978/6987053/06987120.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","publicationTitle":"2014 13th International Conference on Optical Communications and Networks (ICOCN)","doi":"10.1109/ICOCN.2014.6987120","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICOCN.2014.6987120","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6987053","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6987120","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Direct-detection all-optical OFDM superchannel for long-reach PON","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Passive optical networks","OFDM","High-speed optical techniques","Optical filters","Optical fibers","Optical interferometry"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analogue-digital conversion","digital-analogue conversion","fast Fourier transforms","OFDM modulation","optical modulation","passive optical networks","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MMW wireless transmission","passive optical network","mobile broadband services","millimeter-wave wireless transmission","optical wired transmission","demodulated orthogonal subcarriers","optical multiple carrier transmission","DAC/ADC","analog-to-digital converters","electronic digital-to-analog","FFT","fast Fourier transform","high-speed optical access networks","orthogonal-frequency-division-multiplexing","long-reach PON","direct-detection all-optical OFDM superchannel","bit rate 200 Gbit/s","frequency 100 GHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["All-optical OFDM","LR-PON"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6987120/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-10 Nov. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Direct-detection all-optical OFDM superchannel for long-reach PON","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6987120/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2014","accessionNumber":"14822976","dateOfInsertion":"18 December 2014","conferenceDate":"9-10 Nov. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Direct-detection all-optical OFDM superchannel for long-reach PON","confLoc":"Suzhou, China","sourcePdf":"M332.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064177S","chronDate":"9-10 Nov. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6971978","isNumber":"6987053","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6971978","xplore-issue":"6987053","articleId":"6987120","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6987123,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaoxue Gong","affiliation":["College of Information Science and Engineering, Northeastern University, Shenyang, China"],"firstName":"Xiaoxue","lastName":"Gong","id":"38667018800"},{"name":"Yejun Liu","affiliation":["College of Information Science and Engineering, Northeastern University, Shenyang, China"],"firstName":"Yejun","lastName":"Liu","id":"37537566200"},{"name":"Lei Guo","affiliation":["College of Information Science and Engineering, Northeastern University, Shenyang, China"],"firstName":"Lei","lastName":"Guo","id":"37083736300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7218-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6987123","dbTime":"28 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":257},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Loading","Bit error rate","Passive optical networks","Optical fibers","Bit rate","Optical fiber dispersion"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy conservation","error statistics","next generation networks","OFDM modulation","optical modulation","optimisation","passive optical networks","power consumption","signal processing","telecommunication power management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ONU transmitted power","BER constraint","bit optimization","optical network unit","transmitted power minimization","bit error rate","power loading","power consumption","DSP implementation","digital signal processing implementation","flexible resource allocation","spectrum efficiency","next generation access network","OFDM-PON","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing passive optical network"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["OFDM-PON","power efficiency","joint optimization","bit and power loading"]}],"abstract":"Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing Passive Optical Network (OFDM-PON) has been considered as a promising candidate for the next generation access network due to its high spectrum efficiency, flexible resource allocation and natural compatibility with Digital Signal Processing (DSP) implementation. In the OFDM-PON, power efficiency is one of important topics attained extensive attentions because the access network is a main power contributor in the whole infrastructure. The previous works focused on reducing the power consumption of OFDM-PON in the Media Access Control (MAC) layer. In this paper, we investigate the joint optimization of bit and power loading for saving power consumptions in the OFDM-PON from the algorithm level perspective. With the constraints of the total bit rate requirement and the acceptable Bit Error Rate (BER), we aim to minimize the transmitted power of ONUs in the OFDM-PON. We transformed this problem into a mathematic model, and then we proposed an efficient algorithm to jointly optimize the bit and power loading, according to our model. Simulation results demonstrate the performances of our proposed algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/ICOCN.2014.6987123","publicationTitle":"2014 13th International Conference on Optical Communications and Networks (ICOCN)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 13th International Conference on Optical Communications and Networks (ICOCN)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6971978/6987053/06987123.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICOCN.2014.6987123","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6987053","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint optimization of bit and power loading for power efficient OFDM-PON","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6987123","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Joint optimization of bit and power loading for power efficient OFDM-PON","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-10 Nov. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6987123/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"9-10 Nov. 2014","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2014","accessionNumber":"14822991","dateOfInsertion":"18 December 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6987123/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint optimization of bit and power loading for power efficient OFDM-PON","confLoc":"Suzhou, China","sourcePdf":"M335.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042481S","chronDate":"9-10 Nov. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6971978","isNumber":"6987053","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6971978","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6987053","articleId":"6987123","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":6987132,"authors":[{"name":"Fei Xiao","affiliation":["School of Electronic Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (BUPT), Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Fei","lastName":"Xiao","id":"37085373483"},{"name":"Lijia Zhang","affiliation":["School of Electronic Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (BUPT), Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Lijia","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37085379046"},{"name":"Bo Liu","affiliation":["School of Electronic Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (BUPT), Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Bo","lastName":"Liu","id":"37085376220"},{"name":"Qi Zhang","affiliation":["School of Electronic Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (BUPT), Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Qi","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37594274200"},{"name":"Yongjun Wang","affiliation":["School of Electronic Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (BUPT), Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yongjun","lastName":"Wang","id":"37311544000"},{"name":"Jianglong Zheng","affiliation":["School of Electronic Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (BUPT), Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jianglong","lastName":"Zheng","id":"37085383576"},{"name":"Qinghua Tian","affiliation":["School of Electronic Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (BUPT), Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Qinghua","lastName":"Tian","id":"37070215700"},{"name":"Xiaoli Yin","affiliation":["School of Electronic Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (BUPT), Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xiaoli","lastName":"Yin","id":"37406063200"},{"name":"Xiangjun Xin","affiliation":["School of Electronic Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (BUPT), Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xiangjun","lastName":"Xin","id":"37085394936"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7218-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6987132","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":209},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Parity check codes","Bit error rate","Atmospheric modeling","Channel estimation","Signal to noise ratio","Adaptive optics","Laser beams"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["atmospheric turbulence","channel coding","channel estimation","error statistics","matrix algebra","optical communication","parity check codes","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["degree distribution mapping method","parity check matrix","FSO communication","atmospheric turbulence channel","irregular QC-LDPC","channel coding","atmospheric channel estimation feedback","BER performance","turbulence intensity","transmission performance","free-space optical communication"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Atmospheric turbulence channel","Degree distribution mapping method","QC-LDPC"]}],"abstract":"A degree distribution mapping method of parity check matrix in irregular QC-LDPC based FSO communication is proposed.

One known method is to use a slanted lenticular array in order to increase horizontal resolution at the expense of the vertical. In this paper, we propose a different approach to circumvent the displayed resolution limitation by taking advantage of the lower acuity of the eye to chroma than luma. This is done by downsampling the interlaced multiview display image at the color subpixel level. The chromatic information is in effect subsampled in the horizontal dimension (assuming a vertically arranged subpixel structure of the display), while enhancement of luma resolution is achieved. By appropriate slanting of the lenticular so as to minimize Moir\u00e9 effects, the chroma is on average sampled evenly over the different views; therefore, chromatic distortion is also minimized. The vertical sampling rate is not decreased in this method; therefore, the total perceived light field resolution is enhanced. We demonstrate an example with an increase in number of views by 40% for a given lenticular and display setup.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6987227/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 December 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6987227/","dateOfInsertion":"22 September 2015","publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","accessionNumber":"15472509","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"11","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Horizontal Resolution Enhancement of Autostereoscopy Three-Dimensional Displayed Image by Chroma Subpixel Downsampling","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Horizontal Resolution Enhancement of Autostereoscopy Three-Dimensional Displayed Image by Chroma Subpixel Downsampling","sourcePdf":"jdt-marson-2382712-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.059404S","chronDate":"Oct.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"9425","isNumber":"7247778","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9425","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"7247778","articleId":"6987227","onlineDate":"18 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6987231,"authors":[{"name":"H.

Proper numerical results are also provided and depicted using suitable graphs to verify the accuracy of the derived expressions.","doi":"10.1109/JPHOT.2014.2381670","publicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/4563994/6998952/06987231.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"11","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JPHOT.2014.2381670","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6998952","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"QAM and PSK OFDM RoFSO Over <named-content content-type=\"math\" xlink:type=\"simple\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> -</named-content>-Turbulence Induced Fading Channels","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6987231/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 December 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2015","displayDocTitle":"QAM and PSK OFDM RoFSO Over <named-content content-type=\"math\" xlink:type=\"simple\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\"TeX\">$M$</tex-math></inline-formula></named-content>-Turbulence Induced Fading Channels","volume":"7","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"externalId":"7900411","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2015","htmlLink":"/document/6987231/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"European Union (European Social Fund\u2014ESF)"},{"fundingName":"Greek national funds"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"QAM and PSK OFDM RoFSO Over <named-content content-type=\"math\" xlink:type=\"simple\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\"TeX\">$M$</tex-math></inline-formula></named-content>-Turbulence Induced Fading Channels","sourcePdf":"jphot-nistazakis-2381670-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.066363S","chronDate":"Feb.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"4563994","isNumber":"6998952","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4563994","citationCount":"43","xplore-issue":"6998952","articleId":"6987231","onlineDate":"18 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6987233,"authors":[{"name":"Zhixin Liu","affiliation":["Institute of Electrical Engineering, Yanshan University, Qinhuangdao, China"],"firstName":"Zhixin","lastName":"Liu","id":"37274613700"},{"name":"Huanhuan Yuan","affiliation":["Institute of Electrical Engineering, Yanshan University, Qinhuangdao, China"],"firstName":"Huanhuan","lastName":"Yuan","id":"37085414853"},{"name":"Hongxiang Li","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Louisville, Louisville, KY, USA"],"firstName":"Hongxiang","lastName":"Li","id":"37600675300"},{"name":"Xinping Guan","affiliation":["Institute of Electrical Engineering, Yanshan University, Qinhuangdao, China"],"firstName":"Xinping","lastName":"Guan","id":"37085438188"},{"name":"Hongjiu Yang","affiliation":["Institute of Electrical Engineering, Yanshan University, Qinhuangdao, China"],"firstName":"Hongjiu","lastName":"Yang","id":"37403881800"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"6987233","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":18,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":525},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6987233","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robustness","Power control","Relay networks (telecommunications)","Resource management","Optimization","Fading"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplify and forward communication","cellular radio","iterative methods","optimisation","power control","probability","relay networks (telecommunication)","robust control","telecommunication control","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["robust power control","amplify-and-forward cellular relay network","wireless channels","power allocation scheme","optimization problem","utility maximization","distributed iterative algorithm","outage probability threshold","relay station"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Power control","amplify-and-forward","utility maximization","robust distributed algorithm"]},{"kwd":["Power control","amplify-and-forward (AF)","utility maximization","robust distributed algorithm"]}],"abstract":"Power control problem is investigated for amplify-and-forward cellular relay network in this letter.

Typical indoor localization method is Wi-Fi-based positioning system, which is practical showing accuracy and extending coverage. However, it involves significant costs of installing and managing wireless access points. A practical indoor pedestrian-tracking approach should consider the absence of any infrastructure or pretrained database. In this paper, we present a smartphone-based pedestrian dead reckoning, SmartPDR, which tracks pedestrians through typical dead reckoning approach using data from inertial sensors embedded in smartphones. SmartPDR does not require any complex and expensive additional device or infrastructure that most existing pedestrian tracking systems rely on. The proposed system was implemented on off-the-shelf smartphones and the performance was evaluated in several buildings. Despite inherent localization errors from low-cost noisy sensors and complicated human movements, SmartPDR successfully tracks indoor user's location, which is confirmed from the experimental results with reasonable location accuracy. Indoor pedestrian tracking system using smartphone inertial sensors can be a promising methodology validating its practical usage through real deployment.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors

optical (FSO) links under the effect of pointing errors. Both fixed and variable gain relay systems are studied. The RF link is modeled by the Nakagami-m fading channel and the FSO link by the Gamma-Gamma fading channel subject to both types of detection techniques (i.e., heterodyne detection and intensity modulation with direct detection). In particular, we derive new unified closed-form expressions for the cumulative distribution function, the probability density function, the moment generating function (MGF), and the moments of the end-to-end signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of these systems in terms of the Meijer's G function. Based on these formulas, we offer exact closed-form expressions for the outage probability (OP), the higher order amount of fading, and the average bit error rate (BER) of a variety of binary modulations in terms of the Meijer's G function. Furthermore, an exact closed-form expression of the end-to-end ergodic capacity is derived in terms of the bivariate G function. Additionally, by using the asymptotic expansion of the Meijer's G function at the high-SNR regime, we derive new asymptotic results for the OP, the MGF, and the average BER in terms of simple elementary functions.","doi":"10.1109/JPHOT.2014.2381657","publicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/4563994/6998952/06987241.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"20","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JPHOT.2014.2381657","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6998952","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance Analysis of Mixed Nakagami- <named-content content-type=\"math\" xlink:type=\"simple\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> -</named-content> and Gamma\u2013Gamma Dual-Hop FSO Transmission Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6987241/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 December 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2015","displayDocTitle":"Performance Analysis of Mixed Nakagami- <named-content content-type=\"math\" xlink:type=\"simple\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\"TeX\">$m$</tex-math></inline-formula></named-content> and Gamma\u2013Gamma Dual-Hop FSO Transmission Systems","volume":"7","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"externalId":"7900120","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2015","accessionNumber":"14862508","htmlLink":"/document/6987241/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004919","fundingName":"King Abdulaziz City for Science and Technology"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Performance Analysis of Mixed Nakagami- <named-content content-type=\"math\" xlink:type=\"simple\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\"TeX\">$m$</tex-math></inline-formula></named-content> and Gamma\u2013Gamma Dual-Hop FSO Transmission Systems","sourcePdf":"jphot-zedini-2381657-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.128911S","chronDate":"Feb.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"4563994","isNumber":"6998952","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4563994","citationCount":"149","xplore-issue":"6998952","articleId":"6987241","onlineDate":"18 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6987242,"authors":[{"name":"P.

The resonances of the two MUXs were thermooptically tuned in order to achieve 100-GHz channel spacing, revealing a tuning efficiency of 43 and 36 \u03bcW/GHz/RR for MUX1 and MUX2, respectively, and 352 mW total power consumption.

A TOF image sensor with 320 x 240 effective pixels is implemented using a 0.11-\u03bcm CMOS image sensor process. The TOF sensor has a range resolution of less than 12 mm without background light and 20 mm under background line for the range from 0.8 to 1.8 m and integration time of 50 ms.

This method is independent of the numerical method used in the analysis and it can include the effect of the antenna platform. The starting point can be the active element patterns or the spherical mode expansion from spherical near-field antenna measurements. Additionally, the spherical mode expansion is also used to find a matrix which allows the compensation of mutual coupling effects in receiving arrays. Through this theory, a simple relation between the compensation matrices of the transmitting and the receiving arrays is found. As a consequence, the scattering matrix of a circuit that allows the simultaneous compensation of mutual coupling effects for the transmission and the reception problem can be easily defined. Finally, it will be shown how the capabilities of the compensation in all directions depend strongly on the array element.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7027885","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2014.2382691","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel7/8/7027885/06987253.pdf","startPage":"839","endPage":"843","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2014.2382691","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Mutual Coupling Compensation Matrices for Transmitting and Receiving Arrays","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2015","displayDocTitle":"Mutual Coupling Compensation Matrices for Transmitting and Receiving Arrays","volume":"63","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/6987253/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2015","accessionNumber":"14914971","dateOfInsertion":"30 January 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6987253/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 December 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mutual Coupling Compensation Matrices for Transmitting and Receiving Arrays","sourcePdf":"tap-izquierdo-2382691-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.130562S","chronDate":"Feb.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"7027885","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"7027885","articleId":"6987253","onlineDate":"18 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6987254,"authors":[{"name":"Lei Kuang","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Technology, East China Normal University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Lei","lastName":"Kuang","id":"37925072700"},{"name":"Feng Xu","affiliation":["Key laboratory for Information Science of Electromagnetic Waves (MoE), Fudan University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Feng","lastName":"Xu","id":"37289605500"},{"name":"Shouzheng Zhu","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Technology, East China Normal University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Shouzheng","lastName":"Zhu","id":"38667766900"},{"name":"Jianjun Gao","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Technology, East China Normal University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Jianjun","lastName":"Gao","id":"38577744000"},{"name":"Zhengqi Zheng","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Technology, East China Normal University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Zhengqi","lastName":"Zheng","id":"37085449126"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1536-1225"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1548-5757"}],"articleNumber":"6987254","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":496},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society","url":"http://www.ieeeaps.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Doppler effect","Finite difference methods","Time-domain analysis","Laboratories","Electromagnetic scattering","Vectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Doppler radar","electromagnetic wave scattering","finite difference time-domain analysis","Lorentz transformation","object tracking","radar cross-sections","radar tracking"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["relativistic FDTD analysis","far-field scattering","uniformly moving conducting object","uniformly moving dielectric object","Lorentz transformation","free space","motionless object","near zone scattered field","finite difference time domain","near-to-far field transformation","bistatic radar cross section","bistatic RCS","Doppler radar"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Electromagnetic scattering","FDTD algorithm","lorentz transformation","moving object"]}],"abstract":"Far-field scatterings of uniformly moving conducting and dielectric objects are analyzed in this letter. Using the Lorentz transformation, the scattering problem of a high-speed moving object in the laboratory frame, which is stationary with respect to the free space, is transformed to that of a motionless object in the rest frame that moves with the moving object. Then the near-zone scattered fields are solved by the Finite Difference Time Domain (FDTD) algorithm. Applying near-to-far field transformation, far-zone scattered fields are acquired in the rest frame. Subsequently, the scattered fields are transformed back to the laboratory frame.

Logarithmic transformation with bias correction is applied to the original SAR image to transform the multiplicative noise model into the additive model. Then, we adopt a two-stage filtering strategy. The first stage is coarse filtering which can suppress speckle effectively. In this stage, we extract the sliding patches from the logarithmic SAR image, and order them in a smooth way by a simplified patch ordering algorithm specially for SAR images. The ordered patches are filtered by learned simultaneous sparse coding (SSC), a technology recently advanced in image processing. Then, the coarse filtering result is reconstructed from the filtered patches via inverse permutation and subimage averaging. The second stage is refined filtering which can eliminate small artifacts generated by the coarse filtering. In this stage, the sliding patches are extracted from the coarse filtering result and ordered in the same way. Then, we apply 2-D wavelet hard-thresholding to the ordered patches and reconstruct the refined filtering result. The final result is obtained by taking exponential transformation to the refined filtering result. An algorithm based on the proposed strategy is presented in detail and the parameters are selected for fast and effective realization. Experimental results with both simulated images and real SAR images demonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art despeckling performance in terms of peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), structural similarity (SSIM) index, equivalent number of looks (ENLs), and ratio image.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6987262/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 December 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2015","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","publicationDate":"April 2015","accessionNumber":"15177660","htmlLink":"/document/6987262/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"8","issue":"4","isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Patch Ordering-Based SAR Image Despeckling Via Transform-Domain Filtering","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"41171317"},{"fundingName":"key project of the NSFC","grantNumber":"61132008"},{"fundingName":"major research plan of the NSFC","grantNumber":"61490693"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004147","fundingName":"Research Foundation of Tsinghua University"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Patch Ordering-Based SAR Image Despeckling Via Transform-Domain Filtering","sourcePdf":"jstars-xu-2375359-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.10062S","chronDate":"April  2015","xplore-pub-id":"4609443","isNumber":"7112230","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4609443","citationCount":"36","xplore-issue":"7112230","articleId":"6987262","onlineDate":"18 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6987266,"authors":[{"name":"Chichang Hung","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Central University, Jhong-Li City, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8/7027885/6987266/6987266-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Chichang Hung (S'14) was born in Taichung, Taiwan.

Fuzzy logic systems are used to approximate the unknown nonlinear functions, and a switched observer is designed to avoid the conservativeness caused by adoption of a common observer for all subsystems. A common coordinate transformation of all subsystems is constructed to get rid of individual coordinate transformations for subsystems that are required when applying the backstepping recursive design scheme. Meanwhile, since the exponential decline property of Lyapunov functions for individual subsystems is no longer satisfied in this paper, the classical average dwell time method cannot be directly applied. Based on this, a switched observer-based decentralized adaptive fuzzy output-feedback control technique is set up by exploiting the average dwell time method and backstepping. It is proved that all the signals of the resulting closed-loop system are semiglobally uniformly ultimately bounded under a class of switching signals with average dwell time, while the tracking errors converge to a small neighborhood of the origin. The effectiveness of the proposed control scheme is illustrated by its applications to a two-inverted-pendulum system and a quadruple-tank process system.","doi":"10.1109/TFUZZ.2014.2382132","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TFUZZ.2014.2382132","startPage":"1844","endPage":"1860","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/91/7287855/06987268.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7287855","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Decentralized Adaptive Fuzzy Output-Feedback Control of Switched Large-Scale Nonlinear Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6987268/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 December 2014","displayDocTitle":"Decentralized Adaptive Fuzzy Output-Feedback Control of Switched Large-Scale Nonlinear Systems","volume":"23","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"02 October 2015","accessionNumber":"15489098","publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","htmlLink":"/document/6987268/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61233002 and 61233002"},{"fundingName":"IAPI Fundamental Research Funds","grantNumber":"2013ZCX03-02"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds"},{"fundingName":"Central Universities","grantNumber":"N130404026"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002858","fundingName":"China Postdoctoral Science Foundation","grantNumber":"2013M540231"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Decentralized Adaptive Fuzzy Output-Feedback Control of Switched Large-Scale Nonlinear Systems","sourcePdf":"tfuzz-long-2382132-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.114925S","chronDate":"Oct.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"91","isNumber":"7287855","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"91","citationCount":"42","xplore-issue":"7287855","articleId":"6987268","onlineDate":"18 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6987276,"authors":[{"name":"Keegan Kosasih","affiliation":["School of Information Technology and Electrical Engineering, The University of Queensland"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/10/7061913/6987276/kosas-small.gif","p":["Keegan Kosasih (GS\u201910\u2013M\u201910\u2013GS\u201914) was\n born in Medan, Indonesia, in 1986.

One of the biggest challenges faced by pneumonia endemic countries is the absence of a field deployable diagnostic tool that is rapid, low-cost and accurate. In this paper, we address this issue and propose a method to screen pneumonia based on the mathematical analysis of cough sounds. In particular, we propose a novel cough feature inspired by wavelet-based crackle detection work in lung sound analysis. These features are then combined with other mathematical features to develop an automated machine classifier, which can separate pneumonia from a range of other respiratory diseases. Both cough and crackles are symptoms of pneumonia, but their existence alone is not a specific enough marker of the disease. In this paper, we hypothesize that the mathematical analysis of cough sounds allows us to diagnose pneumonia with sufficient sensitivity and specificity. Using a bedside microphone, we collected 815 cough sounds from 91 patients with respiratory illnesses such as pneumonia, asthma, and bronchitis. We extracted wavelet features from cough sounds and combined them with other features such as Mel Cepstral coefficients and non-Gaussianity index. We then trained a logistic regression classifier to separate pneumonia from other diseases. As the reference standard, we used the diagnosis by physicians aided with laboratory and radiological results as deemed necessary for a clinical decision. The methods proposed in this paper achieved a sensitivity and specificity of 94% and 63%, respectively, in separating pneumonia patients from non-pneumonia patients based on wavelet features alone. Combining the wavelets with features from our previous work improves the performance further to 94% and 88% sensitivity and specificity. The performance far surpasses that of the WHO criteria currently in common use in resource-limited settings.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6987276/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 December 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2015","volume":"62","issue":"4","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15000297","pubMedId":"25532164","dateOfInsertion":"18 March 2015","publicationDate":"April 2015","htmlLink":"/document/6987276/","isOpenAccess":true,"isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Wavelet Augmented Cough Analysis for Rapid Childhood Pneumonia Diagnosis","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000865","fundingName":"Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, USA"},{"fundingName":"Challenges in Global Health Exploration","grantNumber":"#OPP1008199 GCE"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Wavelet Augmented Cough Analysis for Rapid Childhood Pneumonia Diagnosis","sourcePdf":"tbme-abeyratne-2381214-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.098142S","chronDate":"April  2015","xplore-pub-id":"10","isNumber":"7061913","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"38","xplore-issue":"7061913","articleId":"6987276","onlineDate":"18 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-09-24"},{"_id":6987278,"authors":[{"name":"Elsa Dupraz","affiliation":["ETIS-ENSEA-Univ.

The main difference to the traditional methods is that the proposed scheme first segments the test image into semantically independent patches prior to keypoint extraction. As a result, the copy-move regions can be detected by matching between these patches. The matching process consists of two stages. In the first stage, we find the suspicious pairs of patches that may contain copy-move forgery regions, and we roughly estimate an affine transform matrix. In the second stage, an Expectation-Maximization-based algorithm is designed to refine the estimated matrix and to confirm the existence of copy-move forgery. Experimental results prove the good performance of the proposed scheme via comparing it with the state-of-the-art schemes on the public databases.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security","pdfPath":"/iel7/10206/7019030/06987281.pdf","startPage":"507","endPage":"518","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security","doi":"10.1109/TIFS.2014.2381872","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIFS.2014.2381872","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7019030","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6987281","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Segmentation-Based Image Copy-Move Forgery Detection Scheme","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Transforms","Image segmentation","Estimation","Forgery","Robustness","Accuracy","Educational institutions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["affine transforms","expectation-maximisation algorithm","image matching","image segmentation","matrix algebra"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["copy-move forgery detection","keypoint extraction","copy-move region detection","patch matching process","suspicious pairs","affine transform matrix","expectation-maximization-based algorithm","matrix estimation","public databases"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Copy-move forgery detection","image forensics","segmentation"]},{"kwd":["Copy-move forgery detection","image forensics","segmentation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6987281/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 December 2014","displayDocTitle":"Segmentation-Based Image Copy-Move Forgery Detection Scheme","volume":"10","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/6987281/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2015","accessionNumber":"14901348","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Jiangsu Basic Research Programs-Natural Science Foundation","grantNumber":"BK20141006 and BK20131004"},{"fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of the Universities in Jiangsu Province","grantNumber":"14KJB520024"},{"fundingName":"NSFC","grantNumber":"61173142, 61232016, 61379151 and 61300238"},{"fundingName":"Startup Foundation for Introducing Talent of NUIST","grantNumber":"2012x053"},{"fundingName":"Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higer Education Institutions"},{"fundingName":"Suzhou Science Project-Applied Basic Research","grantNumber":"SYG201315"},{"fundingName":"PAPD fund"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Segmentation-Based Image Copy-Move Forgery Detection Scheme","sourcePdf":"tifs-li-2381872-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.075631S","chronDate":"March  2015","xplore-pub-id":"10206","isNumber":"7019030","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10206","citationCount":"540","xplore-issue":"7019030","articleId":"6987281","onlineDate":"18 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-31"},{"_id":6987282,"authors":[{"name":"Sumit Paudyal","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Michigan Technological University, Houghton, MI, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5165411/7042857/6987282/paudy-2373271-small.gif","p":["Sumit Paudyal (S\u201907\u2013M\u201913) received the Bachelor\u2019s degree from Tribhuvan University, Kathmandu, Nepal, in 2003; the M.Sc. degree from the University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, SK, Canada, in 2008; and the Ph.D. degree from the University of Waterloo, Waterloo, ON, Canada, in 2012, all in electrical engineering.","He joined the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Michigan Technological University, Houghton, MI, USA, as an Assistant Professor, in 2012.

laser with a bent waveguide and an equivalent chirp compensation based on the sampled grating technique is proposed to improve the single longitudinal mode (SLM) performance for the first time. In such a structure, the bent waveguide is used to form the basically chirped grating so that the zeroth-order resonance is greatly suppressed. However, for the -first-order resonance, the equivalent chirp by designing the sampling pattern is used to compensate the chirp in the -first subgrating caused by bent waveguide. As a result, the -first-order resonance is enhanced, whereas the zeroth resonance is well suppressed. Since the wavelength spacing between the zeroth and -first subgrating can be reduced by adopting this method, the sampling period can be increased. Therefore, the corresponding line in photomask can be enlarged as well to ease the fabrication, and the lasing wavelength accuracy can be further improved according to the theoretical analysis. Because the lasing wavelength can be controlled by changing the sampling period, the performances of the multiwavelength DFB laser array can also be improved using this method.","doi":"10.1109/JPHOT.2014.2381655","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JPHOT.2014.2381655","startPage":"1","endPage":"10","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/4563994/6998952/06987285.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Journal","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6998952","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improved Single-Mode Property of DFB Semiconductor Laser Based on Sampling Technique Using Chirp Compensation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 December 2014","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2015","displayDocTitle":"Improved Single-Mode Property of DFB Semiconductor Laser Based on Sampling Technique Using Chirp Compensation","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","externalId":"1500310","volume":"7","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6987285/","isOpenAccess":true,"accessionNumber":"14862502","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6987285/","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National 863 project","grantNumber":"2011AA010300"},{"fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation for the Youth","grantNumber":"61306068"},{"fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province of Youth","grantNumber":"BK20130585 and BK20140414"},{"fundingName":"National Nature Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61090392 and 61435014"},{"fundingName":"Technology Support Program of Jiangsu Province","grantNumber":"BE2012157"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Improved Single-Mode Property of DFB Semiconductor Laser Based on Sampling Technique Using Chirp Compensation","sourcePdf":"jphot-zheng-2381655-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.338693S","chronDate":"Feb.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"4563994","isNumber":"6998952","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4563994","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6998952","articleId":"6987285","onlineDate":"18 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6987286,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The capture and emission rates of these traps are functions of the time-varying voltages across the device, resulting in nonstationary noise characteristics. Modeling of low-frequency, nonstationary noise in circuit simulators is a long-standing open problem. It has been realized that the low-frequency noise models in circuit simulators were the culprits that produced erroneous noise performance results for circuits under strongly time-varying bias conditions. In this paper, we present two fully nonstationary models for traps, a fine-grained Markov chain model and a coarse-grained Langevin model based on similar models for ion channels in neurons. The nonstationary trap models we present subsume and unify all of the work that has been done recently in the device modeling and circuit design literature on modeling nonstationary trap noise. We provide a detailed explication of these models with regard to their stochastic properties and develop carefully crafted circuit simulation techniques that are stochastically correct. We have implemented the proposed techniques in a MATLAB-based circuit simulator, by expanding the industry standard compact MOSFET model PSP to include a nonstationary description of oxide traps. We present results obtained by this extended model and the proposed simulation techniques for the low-frequency noise characterization of a common source amplifier and the phase jitter of a ring oscillator.","doi":"10.1109/TCAD.2014.2376985","startPage":"794","endPage":"807","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/43/7088672/06987286.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCAD.2014.2376985","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7088672","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modeling and Simulation of Low-Frequency Noise in Nano Devices: Stochastically Correct and Carefully Crafted Numerical Techniques","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Integrated circuit modeling","Mathematical model","Noise","Markov processes","Computational modeling","Numerical models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplifiers","circuit noise","Markov processes","nanoelectronics","oscillators","semiconductor device models","semiconductor device noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low-frequency noise modeling","low-frequency noise simulation","nano devices","stochastically-correct numerical technique","carefully-crafted numerical technique","semiconductors","charge carriers","burst","1/f noise","analog circuit design","digital circuit design","trap emission rate","trap capture","time-varying voltages","nonstationary noise characteristics","erroneous noise performance","time-varying bias conditions","fully nonstationary model","fine-grained Markov chain model","coarse-grained Langevin model","ion channels","neurons","device modeling","circuit design literature","nonstationary trap noise modeling","stochastic properties","MATLAB-based circuit simulator","industry standard compact MOSFET model PSP","oxide traps","common source amplifier","phase jitter","ring oscillator"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["low-frequency noise","RTS noise","nonstationary noise","noise analysis","Langevin equation"]},{"kwd":["Langevin equation","low-frequency noise","noise analysis","nonstationary noise","random telegraph signal (RTS) noise"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6987286/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 December 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2015","displayDocTitle":"Modeling and Simulation of Low-Frequency Noise in Nano Devices: Stochastically Correct and Carefully Crafted Numerical Techniques","volume":"34","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/6987286/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","dateOfInsertion":"17 April 2015","accessionNumber":"15059538","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004410","fundingName":"Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey (T\u00dcB\u0130TAK)","grantNumber":"111E188"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modeling and Simulation of Low-Frequency Noise in Nano Devices: Stochastically Correct and Carefully Crafted Numerical Techniques","sourcePdf":"tcad-mahmutoglu-2376985-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.115995S","chronDate":"May  2015","xplore-pub-id":"43","isNumber":"7088672","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"7088672","articleId":"6987286","onlineDate":"18 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6987288,"authors":[{"name":"Shengchu Wang","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department and Wireless and Mobile Communications R&D Center, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/7081396/6987288/swang-2382098-small.gif","p":["\nShengchu Wang received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electronic \nengineering from Beijing Institute of Technology (BIT) and Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, in 2008 and 2011 \nrespectively.

In the uplink, UEs transmit their data by the Cyclic-Prefix Single-Carrier (CP-SC) SM technique. The key is how to design practical MU detectors to handle the severely quantized measurements and antenna correlations. Coherent detection is focused, so a Least-Square (LS) channel estimator is designed to acquire the the channel side information (CSI) at the Receiver (CSIR). Then, we firstly solve the MUD problem by the Sum-Product-Algorithm (SPA) on a clustered factor graph (FG) whose variable nodes correspond to the transmitted vectors from the UEs. Next, based on the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) and Taylor expansions, the SPA detector (SPAD) is simplified as a new low-complexity Message Passing De-Quantization Detector (MPDQD), which exploits both the structured sparsity and prior probability distribution of the transmitted signal. By utilizing the clustering technique, damping mechanism, and Analog Spatial Filtering (ASF), the robustness of MPDQD is improved significantly. Simulation results show that MPDQD outperforms the linear detectors, works steadily under strong channel correlations, and even performs similarly as its counterpart in the un-quantized SM-MIMO.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2014.2382098","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/7081396/06987288.pdf","startPage":"2156","endPage":"2168","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7081396","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2014.2382098","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiuser Detection in Massive Spatial Modulation MIMO With Low-Resolution ADCs","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6987288","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2015","displayDocTitle":"Multiuser Detection in Massive Spatial Modulation MIMO With Low-Resolution ADCs","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6987288/","publicationDate":"April 2015","dateOfInsertion":"07 April 2015","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"15039143","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6987288/","volume":"14","issue":"4","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 December 2014","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Basic Research Program of China","grantNumber":"2013CB329002"},{"fundingName":"China's 863 Project","grantNumber":"2014AA01A703"},{"fundingName":"National Major Project","grantNumber":"2013ZX03004007"},{"fundingName":"Program for New Century Excellent Talents in University","grantNumber":"NCET-13-0321"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiuser Detection in Massive Spatial Modulation MIMO With Low-Resolution ADCs","sourcePdf":"twc-wang-2382098-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.188121S","chronDate":"April  2015","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"7081396","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"125","xplore-issue":"7081396","articleId":"6987288","onlineDate":"18 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6987298,"authors":[{"name":"Kunlun Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering, Guilin University of Electronics Technology, Guilin, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/7081396/6987298/wang-2382117-small.gif","p":["\nKunlun Wang received the B.S. degree from Hangzhou Dianzi University, \nHangzhou, China, in 2009, and the M.S. degree from South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China, in 2012.

We first investigate the optimal multiple quadrature amplitude modulation (MQAM) constellation size for each transmission stream and the optimal packet size. By exploiting the intrinsic relationship among the constellation size, the packet size, the symbol error rate (SER) and delay, we propose an adaptive transmission mode for different delay demands. For the case of user's buffer overflow, we use the congestion control algorithm to schedule the average queue length, and maintain the optimal delay performance for energy efficiency. Simulations show that to maximize the energy efficiency and offer different Quality of Service (QoS) of delay simultaneously, the transmitter should adaptively choose the constellation size and the packet size as well as the transmission mode. In this framework, the tradeoff between energy efficiency and delay demand are well demonstrated.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/7081396/06987298.pdf","startPage":"2169","endPage":"2179","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2014.2382117","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2014.2382117","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7081396","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6987298","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy-Efficient Communications in MIMO Systems Based on Adaptive Packets and Congestion Control With Delay Constraints","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Delays","MIMO","Transmitters","Power demand","Receivers","Optimized production technology","Wireless communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive control","energy conservation","error statistics","MIMO communication","quadrature amplitude modulation","quality of service","telecommunication congestion control","telecommunication power management","telecommunication scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy-efficient MIMO communication","adaptive packet control","congestion control","delay constraint","multiple input multiple output system","multiple quadrature amplitude modulation","MQAM","symbol error rate","SER","adaptive transmission mode","user buffer overflow","average queue length scheduling","energy efficiency maximize","quality of service","QoS","transmitter"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MIMO","Energy efficiency","Packet Size","MQAM Constellation Size","Delay","Congestion Control"]},{"kwd":["MIMO","energy efficiency","packet size","MQAM constellation size","delay","congestion control"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6987298/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 December 2014","displayDocTitle":"Energy-Efficient Communications in MIMO Systems Based on Adaptive Packets and Congestion Control With Delay Constraints","volume":"14","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/6987298/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2015","accessionNumber":"15039121","dateOfInsertion":"07 April 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National 973","grantNumber":"2012CB316106"},{"fundingName":"NSF China","grantNumber":"61161130529 and 61328101"},{"fundingName":"STCSM Science and Technology Innovation Program","grantNumber":"13510711200"},{"fundingName":"SEU National Key Lab on Mobile Communications","grantNumber":"2013D11"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy-Efficient Communications in MIMO Systems Based on Adaptive Packets and Congestion Control With Delay Constraints","sourcePdf":"twc-chen-2382117-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.122771S","chronDate":"April  2015","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"7081396","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"7081396","articleId":"6987298","onlineDate":"18 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6987299,"authors":[{"name":"Luc Chassagne","affiliation":["Laboratoire d\u2019Ing\u00e9nierie des Syst\u00e8mes de Versailles, University of Versailles Saint-Quentin, Versailles, France"],"bio":{"p":["Luc Chassagne received the Engineering degree from Supelec, Paris, France, in 1994, and the Ph.D. degree in optoelectronics from University Paris-Sud, Orsay, France, in 2000, with a minor in atomic frequency standard metrology.

To characterize the channel dynamics in wide-sense stationary uncorrelated scattering wireless environments, proper autoregressive (AR) channel models for different fading speeds are discussed from the viewpoints of the mean squared error (MSE) and Bayesian Cram\u00e9r-Rao lower bound (BCRB) of channel estimation. Furthermore, the training efficacy is examined with the achievable capacity when the MSE of channel estimation attains the BCRB. Our numerical simulations show that neither is the first-order AR model enough, nor is a large-order AR model needed for modeling time-varying fading channels. The analysis on BCRB also shows that the influence of the multiple access interference among transmit antennas is not negligible for channel estimation in time-varying fading channels even if using orthogonal sequences for training. As channel tracking can utilize the current and all past training symbols, the optimal training lengths for each data packet may be less than the number of transmit antennas. These results help re-examine the efficacy of model complexity and training overhead, and characterize the achievable rate for MIMO systems that use more practical methods in estimating Rayleigh fading channels.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/7010064/06987302.pdf","startPage":"140","endPage":"155","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2014.2382103","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2014.2382103","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7010064","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6987302","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Effective Approach to Evaluate the Training and Modeling Efficacy in MIMO Time-Varying Fading Channels","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","MIMO","Channel estimation","Fading","Vectors","Numerical models","Transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["autoregressive moving average processes","Bayes methods","channel capacity","channel estimation","fading channels","mean square error methods","MIMO communication","time-varying channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiple access interference","orthogonal sequences","channel tracking","training efficacy","AR channel model","training-based channel capacity","channel estimation","Bayesian Cramer-Rao lower bound","mean squared error","autoregressive channel models","wide-sense stationary uncorrelated scattering wireless environments","channel dynamics","channel modeling","MIMO time-varying fading channels"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MIMO fading channels","Bayesian CRLB","Training-Based channel capacity","AR channel model"]},{"kwd":["AR channel model","Bayesian CRLB","MIMO fading channels","training-based channel capacity"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6987302/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 December 2014","displayDocTitle":"An Effective Approach to Evaluate the Training and Modeling Efficacy in MIMO Time-Varying Fading Channels","volume":"63","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/6987302/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2015","accessionNumber":"14851075","dateOfInsertion":"14 January 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001868","fundingName":"National Science Council, Taiwan","grantNumber":"102-2219-E-009-003"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Effective Approach to Evaluate the Training and Modeling Efficacy in MIMO Time-Varying Fading Channels","sourcePdf":"tcomm-chiu-2382103-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.107183S","chronDate":"Jan.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"7010064","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7010064","articleId":"6987302","onlineDate":"18 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6987312,"authors":[{"name":"Claudia Lindner","affiliation":["Centre for Imaging Sciences, The University of Manchester, Manchester, United Kingdom"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/34/7175116/6987312/lindn-small.gif","p":["Claudia Lindner received the BSc degree and the MSc degree both in\n computer science with distinction from the Heinrich Heine University D\u00fcsseldorf, D\u00fcsseldorf, Germany, in\n 2005 and 2007, respectively.

We demonstrate that Random Forest regression-voting can be used to generate high quality response images quickly. Rather than using a generative or a discriminative model to evaluate each pixel, a regressor is used to cast votes for the optimal position of each point. We show that this leads to fast and accurate shape model matching when applied in the Constrained Local Model framework. We evaluate the technique in detail, and compare it with a range of commonly used alternatives across application areas: the annotation of the joints of the hands in radiographs and the detection of feature points in facial images.

Attribute-based encryption (ABE) is a promising technique to ensure the end-to-end security of big data in the cloud. However, the policy updating has always been a challenging issue when ABE is used to construct access control schemes. A trivial implementation is to let data owners retrieve the data and re-encrypt it under the new access policy, and then send it back to the cloud. This method, however, incurs a high communication overhead and heavy computation burden on data owners. In this paper, we propose a novel scheme that enabling efficient access control with dynamic policy updating for big data in the cloud. We focus on developing an outsourced policy updating method for ABE systems. Our method can avoid the transmission of encrypted data and minimize the computation work of data owners, by making use of the previously encrypted data with old access policies. Moreover, we also propose policy updating algorithms for different types of access policies. Finally, we propose an efficient and secure method that allows data owner to check whether the cloud server has updated the ciphertexts correctly. The analysis shows that our policy updating outsourcing scheme is correct, complete, secure and efficient.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/71/7323921/06987313.pdf","startPage":"3461","endPage":"3470","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","doi":"10.1109/TPDS.2014.2380373","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPDS.2014.2380373","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7323921","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6987313","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Secure and Verifiable Policy Update Outsourcing for Big Data Access Control in the Cloud","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cloud computing","Big data","Access control","Encryption","Algorithm design and analysis","Public key"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["authorisation","Big Data","cloud computing","cryptography","outsourcing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["secure policy update outsourcing","verifiable policy update outsourcing","Big Data access control","cloud","user access requests","attribute-based encryption","end-to-end security","data owners","data retrieval","reencryption","access policy","communication overhead","dynamic policy updating","outsourced policy updating method","ABE systems","encrypted data transmission"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Policy updating","outsourcing","access control","ABAC","ABE","big data","cloud"]},{"kwd":["Policy updating","outsourcing","access control","ABAC","ABE","big data","cloud"]}],"chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/71/7323921/6987313-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6987313/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec. 1 2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 December 2014","displayDocTitle":"Secure and Verifiable Policy Update Outsourcing for Big Data Access Control in the Cloud","volume":"26","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/6987313/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"1 Dec. 2015","accessionNumber":"15587646","dateOfInsertion":"11 November 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002920","fundingName":"RGC HK","grantNumber":"CityU 114112"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"NSF US","grantNumber":"CNS-1262277"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Secure and Verifiable Policy Update Outsourcing for Big Data Access Control in the Cloud","sourcePdf":"tpds-yang-2380373-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.091062S","chronDate":"Dec. 1 2015","xplore-pub-id":"71","isNumber":"7323921","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"71","citationCount":"68","xplore-issue":"7323921","articleId":"6987313","onlineDate":"18 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6987316,"authors":[{"name":"Chuting Yao","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Information Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/7041264/6987316/yao-2382120_print-small.gif","p":["\nChuting Yao received the B.

Since the EE of a system is evaluated during a period of time, a transmission strategy designed from maximizing instantaneous EE (INEE) may not achieve the maximal EE of the system. To exploit the accumulative nature of the energy, accumulative EE (ACEE) can be used as the objective function, which is the ratio of the accumulated amount of data transmitted to the accumulated energy consumed until the time for optimization. In this paper, we study when ACEE is beneficial to EE-oriented optimization. By taking a single user multi-antenna multi-subcarrier system serving two classes of traffic as an example, we formulate three problems to optimize rate allocation among subcarriers and time slots respectively maximizing the INEE, ACEE and EE upper-bound, which can be easily extended to multi-user systems. We proceed to analyze the behavior and performance of the corresponding solutions. Analytical and simulation results show that using ACEE yields a more energy efficient design for the systems serving best effort traffic with less transmit antennas, serving less users simultaneously or at low signal to noise ratio under time-varying channels. However, the conclusions for real-time traffic are different.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7041264","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2014.2382120","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/7041264/06987316.pdf","startPage":"401","endPage":"415","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2014.2382120","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Is Accumulative Information Useful for Designing Energy Efficient Transmission?","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2015","displayDocTitle":"Is Accumulative Information Useful for Designing Energy Efficient Transmission?","volume":"63","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/6987316/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2015","accessionNumber":"14930617","dateOfInsertion":"12 February 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6987316/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 December 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"China (NSFC)","grantNumber":"61120106002"},{"fundingName":"China 973 Program","grantNumber":"2012CB316003"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Is Accumulative Information Useful for Designing Energy Efficient Transmission?","sourcePdf":"tcomm-yang-2382120-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.138431S","chronDate":"Feb.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"7041264","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7041264","articleId":"6987316","onlineDate":"18 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6987329,"authors":[{"name":"Kun Zhu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, MB, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/7041264/6987329/zhu-2382095_print-small.gif","p":["\nKun Zhu received the Ph.D. degree from School of Computer Engineering,\nNanyang Technological University, Singapore, in 2012.

A non-cooperative setting is assumed where the macro base stations (MBSs) and small cell base stations (SBSs) compete with each other to maximize their own capacities considering imperfect channel state information. A robust Stackelberg game (RSG) is formulated to model this hierarchical competition where the MBSs and SBSs act as the leaders and the followers, respectively. The formulated RSG can be expressed as an equilibrium program with equilibrium constraints (EPEC). A comprehensive study of this RSG is provided considering various power constraints (e.g., total and spectral mask), various interference constraints (e.g., individual and global), and different uncertainty models (e.g., column-wise and ellipsoidal). We show how the different constraints and uncertainty models change the property of the game (e.g., Nash equilibrium problem (NEP) or generalized Nash equilibrium problem (GNEP)) and accordingly impact the choice of analysis method (e.g., game theory or variational inequality (VI)), solution (e.g., closed-form or numerical), and the design of algorithms and their distributive properties (e.g., totally distributed, semi-distributed, and centralized). A robust Stackelberg equilibrium (RSE) is considered to be the solution and its existence and uniqueness are investigated. Also, algorithms are proposed to arrive at the RSE. Numerical results show the effectiveness of robust solutions in an imperfect information environment.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/7041264/06987329.pdf","startPage":"520","endPage":"535","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2014.2382095","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2014.2382095","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7041264","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6987329","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Downlink Power Control in Two-Tier Cellular OFDMA Networks Under Uncertainties: A Robust Stackelberg Game","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Uncertainty","Robustness","Games","Interference constraints","Resource management","Scattering","Power control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","frequency division multiple access","game theory","OFDM modulation","power control","telecommunication control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["orthogonal frequency-division multiple access","two-tier cellular OFDMA networks","robust Stackelberg game","RSG","power control","heterogeneous wireless networks","HetNets","macrocells","macrobase stations","MBS","small cell base stations","SBS","channel state information","equilibrium program with equilibrium constraints","EPEC","generalized Nash equilibrium problem","GNEP","robust Stackelberg equilibrium","RSE"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Small cell networks","power control","uncertainty","robust Stackelberg game","worst-case analysis","equilibrium program with equilibrium constraints","generalized Nash equilibrium problem","variational inequality"]},{"kwd":["Small cell networks","power control","uncertainty","robust Stackelberg game","worst-case analysis","equilibrium program with equilibrium constraints","generalized Nash equilibrium problem","variational inequality"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6987329/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 December 2014","displayDocTitle":"Downlink Power Control in Two-Tier Cellular OFDMA Networks Under Uncertainties: A Robust Stackelberg Game","volume":"63","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/6987329/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2015","accessionNumber":"14930615","dateOfInsertion":"12 February 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Downlink Power Control in Two-Tier Cellular OFDMA Networks Under Uncertainties: A Robust Stackelberg Game","sourcePdf":"tcomm-hossain-2382095-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.109838S","chronDate":"Feb.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"7041264","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"74","xplore-issue":"7041264","articleId":"6987329","onlineDate":"18 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6987330,"authors":[{"name":"Shuiguang Deng","affiliation":["College of Computer Science and Technology, Zhejiang University"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/71/7323921/6987330/deng-small.gif","p":["Shuiguang Deng received the BS and PhD degrees in computer science\n from Zhejiang University in 2002 and 2007, respectively.

A mobile device should judiciously determine whether to offload computation as well as what portion of an application should be offloaded to the cloud. This paper considers a mobile computation offloading problem where multiple mobile services in workflows can be invoked to fulfill their complex requirements and makes decision on whether the services of a workflow should be offloaded. Due to the mobility of portable devices, unstable connectivity of mobile networks can impact the offloading decision. To address this issue, we propose a novel offloading system to design robust offloading decisions for mobile services. Our approach considers the dependency relations among component services and aims to optimize execution time and energy consumption of executing mobile services. To this end, we also introduce a mobility model and a trade-off fault-tolerance mechanism for the offloading system. A genetic algorithm (GA) based offloading method is then designed and implemented after carefully modifying parts of a generic GA to match our special needs for the stated problem. Experimental results are promising and show nearoptimal solutions for all of our studied cases with almost linear algorithmic complexity with respect to the problem size.","doi":"10.1109/TPDS.2014.2381640","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/71/7323921/06987330.pdf","startPage":"3317","endPage":"3329","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7323921","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPDS.2014.2381640","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Computation Offloading for Service Workflow in Mobile Cloud Computing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6987330","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec. 1 2015","displayDocTitle":"Computation Offloading for Service Workflow in Mobile Cloud Computing","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6987330/","publicationDate":"1 Dec. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"10 November 2015","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"15587647","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6987330/","volume":"26","issue":"12","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 December 2014","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61170033"},{"fundingName":"National High-Tech Research and Development Plan of China","grantNumber":"2013BAD19B10"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Computation Offloading for Service Workflow in Mobile Cloud Computing","sourcePdf":"tpds-deng-2381640-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.099608S","chronDate":"Dec. 1 2015","xplore-pub-id":"71","isNumber":"7323921","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"71","citationCount":"167","xplore-issue":"7323921","articleId":"6987330","onlineDate":"18 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-20"},{"_id":6987331,"authors":[{"name":"Mostafa Taha","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Virginia Tech, Blacksburg, VA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/10206/7019030/6987331/taha-2383359-small.gif","p":["Mostafa Taha (S\u201912\u2013M\u201914) is currently a Post-Doctoral Fellow with the Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, Worcester Polytechnic Institute, Worcester, MA, USA.

The real threat of SCA lies in the ability to mount attacks over small parts of the key and to aggregate information over different encryptions. The threat of SCA can be thwarted by changing the secret key at every run. Indeed, many contributions in the domain of leakage resilient cryptography tried to achieve this goal. However, the proposed solutions were computationally intensive and were not designed to solve the problem of the current cryptographic schemes. In this paper, we propose a generic framework of lightweight key updating that can protect the current cryptographic standards and evaluate the minimum requirements for heuristic SCA-security. Then, we propose a complete solution to protect the implementation of any standard mode of Advanced Encryption Standard. Our solution maintains the same level of SCA-security (and sometimes better) as the state of the art, at a negligible area overhead while doubling the throughput of the best previous work.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 December 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6987331/","volume":"10","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/6987331/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"14901350","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 2015","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Key Updating for Leakage Resiliency With Application to AES Modes of Operation","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Virginia Tech-Middle East and North Africa Program, Egypt"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"1115839"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Key Updating for Leakage Resiliency With Application to AES Modes of Operation","sourcePdf":"tifs-taha-2383359-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.088654S","chronDate":"March  2015","xplore-pub-id":"10206","isNumber":"7019030","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10206","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"7019030","articleId":"6987331","onlineDate":"18 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6987333,"authors":[{"name":"Junwei Han","affiliation":["School of Automation, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi\u2019an, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/76/7174606/6987333/han-2381471-small.gif","p":["Junwei Han received the Ph.D. degree from Northwestern Polytechnical University (NWPU), Xi\u2019an, China, in 2003.","He is a Professor with NWPU.

Based on the assumption that foreground salient regions are distinctive within a certain context, most conventional approaches rely on a number of hand-designed features and their distinctiveness is measured using local or global contrast. Although these approaches have been shown to be effective in dealing with simple images, their limited capability may cause difficulties when dealing with more complicated images. This paper proposes a novel framework for saliency detection by first modeling the background and then separating salient objects from the background. We develop stacked denoising autoencoders with deep learning architectures to model the background where latent patterns are explored and more powerful representations of data are learned in an unsupervised and bottom-up manner. Afterward, we formulate the separation of salient objects from the background as a problem of measuring reconstruction residuals of deep autoencoders. Comprehensive evaluations of three benchmark datasets and comparisons with nine state-of-the-art algorithms demonstrate the superiority of this paper.","doi":"10.1109/TCSVT.2014.2381471","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/76/7174606/06987333.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7174606","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSVT.2014.2381471","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","startPage":"1309","endPage":"1321","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Background Prior-Based Salient Object Detection via Deep Reconstruction Residual","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6987333","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 December 2014","displayDocTitle":"Background Prior-Based Salient Object Detection via Deep Reconstruction Residual","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6987333/","volume":"25","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/6987333/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2015","accessionNumber":"15342497","dateOfInsertion":"31 July 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61103061, 91120005 and 61473231"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Background Prior-Based Salient Object Detection via Deep Reconstruction Residual","sourcePdf":"tcsvt-han-2381471-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.149836S","chronDate":"Aug.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"76","isNumber":"7174606","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"261","xplore-issue":"7174606","articleId":"6987333","onlineDate":"18 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6987334,"authors":[{"name":"Felix Dobslaw","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, Mid-Sweden University, Sundsvall, Sweden"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/9424/7442910/6987334/dobsl-2382335-small.gif","p":["Felix Dobslaw received the B.Sc. degree in information sciences from the University of Hamburg, Hamburg, Germany, in 2007, and the M.Sc. degree in distributed systems from Mid Sweden University, Sundsvall, Sweden, in 2009.

For mission-critical applications, communication networks must provide end-to-end reliability guarantees, posing substantial challenges for WSN. Reliability can be improved by redundancy, and is often addressed on the MAC layer by resubmission of lost packets, usually applying slotted scheduling. Recently, researchers have proposed a strategy to optimally improve the reliability of a given schedule by repeating the most rewarding slots in a schedule incrementally until a deadline. This Incrementer can be used with most scheduling algorithms but has scalability issues which narrows its usability to offline calculations of schedules, for networks that are rather static. In this paper, we introduce SchedEx, a generic heuristic scheduling algorithm extension, which guarantees a user-defined end-to-end reliability. SchedEx produces competitive schedules to the existing approach, and it does that consistently more than an order of magnitude faster. The harsher the end-to-end reliability demand of the network, the better the SchedEx performs compared to the Incrementer. We further show that SchedEx has a more evenly distributed improvement impact on the scheduling algorithms, whereas the Incrementer favors schedules created by certain scheduling algorithms.","doi":"10.1109/TII.2014.2382335","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7442910","startPage":"758","endPage":"767","pdfPath":"/iel7/9424/7442910/06987334.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TII.2014.2382335","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"End-to-End Reliability-Aware Scheduling for Wireless Sensor Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Reliability","Schedules","Job shop scheduling","Wireless sensor networks","Scheduling algorithms","Routing","Transceivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["telecommunication network reliability","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["end-to-end reliability-aware scheduling","wireless sensor networks","WSN","MAC layer","SchedEx","generic heuristic scheduling algorithm extension"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Mission-Critical","IndustrialWireless Sensor Networks","Reliable Packet Delivery","TDMA"]},{"kwd":["Industrial wireless sensor networks","mission-critical","reliable packet delivery","time-division multiple access (TDMA)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2016","displayDocTitle":"End-to-End Reliability-Aware Scheduling for Wireless Sensor Networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6987334/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 December 2014","dateOfInsertion":"29 March 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"12","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/6987334/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"15887411","publicationDate":"April 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"End-to-End Reliability-Aware Scheduling for Wireless Sensor Networks","sourcePdf":"tii-dobslaw-2382335-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.115152S","chronDate":"April  2016","xplore-pub-id":"9424","isNumber":"7442910","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9424","citationCount":"67","xplore-issue":"7442910","articleId":"6987334","onlineDate":"18 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6987360,"authors":[{"name":"Hao Quan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5962385/7206790/6987360/quan-2376696-small.gif","p":["Hao Quan (S\u201911) received the B.Eng. degree in water conservancy and hydropower engineering from the Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China, in 2008.

In this paper, the nonparametric neural network-based prediction intervals (PIs) are implemented for forecast uncertainty quantification. Instead of a single level PI, wind power forecast uncertainties are represented in a list of PIs. These PIs are then decomposed into quantiles of wind power. A new scenario generation method is proposed to handle wind power forecast uncertainties. For each hour, an empirical cumulative distribution function (ECDF) is fitted to these quantile points. The Monte Carlo simulation method is used to generate scenarios from the ECDF. Then the wind power scenarios are incorporated into a stochastic security-constrained unit commitment (SCUC) model. The heuristic genetic algorithm is utilized to solve the stochastic SCUC problem. Five deterministic and four stochastic case studies incorporated with interval forecasts of wind power are implemented. The results of these cases are presented and discussed together. Generation costs, and the scheduled and real-time economic dispatch reserves of different unit commitment strategies are compared. The experimental results show that the stochastic model is more robust than deterministic ones and, thus, decreases the risk in system operations of smart grids.","doi":"10.1109/TNNLS.2014.2376696","startPage":"2123","endPage":"2135","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNNLS.2014.2376696","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7206790","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/5962385/7206790/06987360.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Incorporating Wind Power Forecast Uncertainties Into Stochastic Unit Commitment Using Neural Network-Based Prediction Intervals","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6987360/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Incorporating Wind Power Forecast Uncertainties Into Stochastic Unit Commitment Using Neural Network-Based Prediction Intervals","volume":"26","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/6987360/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15414264","pubMedId":"25532191","publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 December 2014","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001321","fundingName":"National Research Foundation","grantNumber":"R-263-000-A66-279"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000923","fundingName":"Australian Research Council","grantNumber":"DP120102112"},{"fundingName":"Centre for Intelligent Systems Research, Deakin University, Geelong, VIC, Australia"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Incorporating Wind Power Forecast Uncertainties Into Stochastic Unit Commitment Using Neural Network-Based Prediction Intervals","sourcePdf":"tnnls-quan-2376696-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.121795S","chronDate":"Sept.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"5962385","isNumber":"7206790","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5962385","citationCount":"65","xplore-issue":"7206790","articleId":"6987360","onlineDate":"18 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-12"},{"_id":6987371,"authors":[{"name":"Hong Gul Han","affiliation":["School of Electrical & Electronic Engineering, Yonsei University, Seoul, Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/7053970/6987371/6987371-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Hong Gul Han was born in 1984 in Korea.

The other feedback loop is voltage-current feedback by cross-coupling between the drain node and the source node in the common gate topology. In particular, the first feedback loop is able to reduce the amplification of a second-order signal while it boosts the transconductance of a fundamental signal thus, it can reduce the second order harmonic feedback effect to the input-referred third-order intercept point (IIP3) which is one of the major bottlenecks of linearity enhancement using feedback. As the first feedback removes second-order harmonic distortion, the second feedback successfully enhances IIP3. The proposed LNA achieves excellent performance with low power consumption. The LNA is implemented with a 0.13 \u03bcm CMOS process and measured. The measurement results demonstrate a gain of 18 dB, a noise figure (NF) of 1.94 dB, an IIP3 of 9.06 dBm, an input matching (S11)/output matching (S22) of less than -10 dB at 900 MHz, and a power consumption of 2.4 mA with 1.2 V supply voltage.","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.2014.2377036","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel7/22/7053970/06987371.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.2014.2377036","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7053970","startPage":"1019","endPage":"1025","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 2.88 mW - 9.06 dBm IIP3 Common-Gate LNA With Dual Cross-Coupled Capacitive Feedback","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6987371","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A 2.88 mW <formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex Notation=\"TeX\">$+$</tex></formula> 9.06 dBm IIP3 Common-Gate LNA With Dual Cross-Coupled Capacitive Feedback","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6987371/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 December 2014","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"63","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 2015","accessionNumber":"14964485","dateOfInsertion":"03 March 2015","htmlLink":"/document/6987371/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 2.88 mW <formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex Notation=\"TeX\">$+$</tex></formula> 9.06 dBm IIP3 Common-Gate LNA With Dual Cross-Coupled Capacitive Feedback","sourcePdf":"tmtt-kim-2377036-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.065447S","chronDate":"March  2015","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"7053970","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"32","xplore-issue":"7053970","articleId":"6987371","onlineDate":"18 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6987379,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaoyan Gui","affiliation":["Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/7000613/6987379/6987379-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Xiaoyan Gui received the B.E. and the M.E. degrees from Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China, in 2003 and 2005 respectively, the M.S. degree from University at Buffalo, Buffalo, NY, USA, in 2007 and the Ph.D. degree from University of California, Irvine, CA, USA, in 2011, all in electrical engineering.","From 2008 to 2010, he did multiple internships in Broadcom Corporation, Irvine, CA and was with the same group from 2011 to 2012 as a staff scientist working on designs of high-speed SerDes transceivers for optical/backplane applications.

The analysis includes novel expressions for missed-detection probability and area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. Thus, a unified framework covering fading channels, square-law diversity combining, and cooperative spectrum-sensing scenarios is developed. The detection threshold is optimized to minimize the total error rate subject to bounded false-alarm and missed-detection probabilities, which outperforms traditional detection threshold selection.

In fixed DF protocols, the error propagation effect that limits the diversity gain can be overcome by using joint maximum-likelihood (JML) detection, but its complexity increases exponentially with the number of streams and modulation orders. To develop a low-complexity detection scheme, we first extend the cooperative maximum-ratio combining (C-MRC) scheme to MIMO relay networks, and then investigate the diversity order of the system. We show that C-MRC achieves full diversity gain for orthogonal space-time code, but its diversity gain is limited when the deployed space-time code is non-orthogonal. To address this problem, we propose an effective detection scheme that is applicable to arbitrary space-time codes. On the basis of pairwise error probability approximation, max-log approximation, and the Chernoff bound, we construct an equivalent point-to-point MIMO signal model, and then apply tree-search detection techniques. Compared to JML, the proposed detection scheme significantly reduces the detection complexity while preserving diversity gain. Moreover, it can be readily extended to complex-field network-coding systems whose performance is superior to that of Galois-field network-coding systems. Analysis and simulation results confirm the efficiency of the proposed scheme.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2014.2382100","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/7010064/06987541.pdf","startPage":"94","endPage":"106","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2014.2382100","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7010064","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low-Complexity Detection Scheme for Cooperative MIMO Systems With Decode-and-Forward Relays","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6987541","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 December 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6987541/","displayDocTitle":"Low-Complexity Detection Scheme for Cooperative MIMO Systems With Decode-and-Forward Relays","volume":"63","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2015","accessionNumber":"14851095","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6987541/","dateOfInsertion":"14 January 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Basic Science Research Program"},{"fundingName":"National Research Foundation of Korea"},{"fundingName":"Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning","grantNumber":"2014R1A2A2A05005127 and 2014R1A5A1011478"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low-Complexity Detection Scheme for Cooperative MIMO Systems With Decode-and-Forward Relays","sourcePdf":"tcomm-im-2382100-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.136297S","chronDate":"Jan.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"7010064","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"7010064","articleId":"6987541","onlineDate":"18 December 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6987543,"authors":[{"name":"Asim Zaheer","affiliation":["College of Electrical and Mechanical Engineering, National University of Sciences and Technology, Islamabad, Pakistan"],"firstName":"Asim","lastName":"Zaheer","id":"37072044600"},{"name":"Muhammad Salman","affiliation":["College of Electrical and Mechanical Engineering, National University of Sciences and Technology, Islamabad, Pakistan"],"firstName":"Muhammad","lastName":"Salman","id":"37301514400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-8-9932-1507-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-8-9932-1506-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2093-7121"}],"articleNumber":"6987543","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":164},"abstract":"In this work, black-box model identification and output prediction for unknown sampled-data minimum phase system has been achieved.

We believe that, to successfully \u201cport\u201d biological strengths to the engineering world, such a tight relationship has to be loosened, and a new multi-domain co-design approach has to be devised. By exploiting the properties of the information processing, we are able to better design and integrate information transmission subsystems, with particular regard to the power consumption; by taking into account low-power requirements/constraints, we can develop energy-aware information processing modules. Designing the whole systems in a modular way, allows us to easily re-design a full-fledged system for new scenarios/applications. The research regards the implementation of discrete component systems as well, so that integrated circuits or proof-of-concept implementations can be easily validated.","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 10th International Conference on Innovations in Information Technology (IIT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6973089/6985764/06987560.pdf","startPage":"48","endPage":"53","publicationTitle":"2014 10th International Conference on Innovations in Information Technology (IIT)","doi":"10.1109/INNOVATIONS.2014.6987560","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INNOVATIONS.2014.6987560","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6985764","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6987560","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Integrated bio-inspired systems: An event-driven design framework","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wireless sensor networks","Robot sensing systems","Wireless communication","Nanobioscience","Circuits and systems","Computer architecture"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biology computing","biomimetics","discrete event simulation","discrete event systems","humanoid robots"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["integrated bio-inspired systems","event-driven design framework","human robotics","research field","mechanical engineering","electrical engineering","biology","neuromorphic engineering","biological systems","spiking information processing","event driven information processing","learning behavior","electronic domain","biological domain","energy aware information processing modules","discrete component systems"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6987560/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 Nov. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Integrated bio-inspired systems: An event-driven design framework","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6987560/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2014","accessionNumber":"14823025","dateOfInsertion":"18 December 2014","conferenceDate":"9-11 Nov. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Integrated bio-inspired systems: An event-driven design framework","confLoc":"Al Ain, United Arab Emirates","sourcePdf":"p48mottoros.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054523S","chronDate":"9-11 Nov. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6973089","isNumber":"6985764","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6973089","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6985764","articleId":"6987560","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6987566,"authors":[{"name":"Mihai Tache","affiliation":["College of Information Technology, United Arab Emirates University, Al Ain, UAE"],"firstName":"Mihai","lastName":"Tache","id":"37892246700"},{"name":"Fekri Kharbash","affiliation":["College of Information Technology, United Arab Emirates University, Al Ain, UAE"],"firstName":"Fekri","lastName":"Kharbash","id":"37061132200"},{"name":"Valeriu Beiu","affiliation":["College of Information Technology, United Arab Emirates University, Al Ain, UAE"],"firstName":"Valeriu","lastName":"Beiu","id":"37270882100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7212-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7210-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6987566","dbTime":"21 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":105},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["SRAM cells","Optimized production technology","Transistors","CMOS integrated circuits","Reliability","Noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS memory circuits","low-power electronics","semiconductor device reliability","SRAM chips","transistors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["SRAM bit-cells","reliability-centric design method","transistor sizing","ultralow voltage SRAM cells","ULV SRAM cells","SNM","static noise margin"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["CMOS","SRAM","transistor sizing","static noise margin (SNM)","reliability"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6987566","abstract":"Noises and variations are ubiquitous, but are still being ill-understood and in most cases treated simplistically, leading in most cases to substantial overdesign costs.

Spectrum sharing among secondary users is one of the main issues for developing a robust cognitive radio system. In this paper, a modified cognitive radio spectrum sharing algorithm based on the Hungarian algorithm is proposed. The algorithm divides the allocation problem into two; the first problem is when all channels satisfy the minimum quality of service for all secondary users and the second problem is when one or more of the channels fails to meet the requirements. The Hungarian algorithm is applied for the first problem to provide an optimal spectrum sharing solution between the secondary users while guaranteeing the different quality of service requested by each one. For the second problem an algorithm is proposed to find the optimal spectrum allocation for the set of channels which meet the quality of service requirements of secondary users. Simulation results are presented to show how robust is proposed algorithm to meet the required quality of service.","doi":"10.1109/INNOVATIONS.2014.6987573","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 10th International Conference on Innovations in Information Technology (IIT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6973089/6985764/06987573.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6985764","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INNOVATIONS.2014.6987573","publicationTitle":"2014 10th International Conference on Innovations in Information Technology (IIT)","startPage":"116","endPage":"121","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spectrum sharing with quality of service assurance in cognitive radio networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6987573","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 Nov. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Spectrum sharing with quality of service assurance in cognitive radio networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6987573/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6987573/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2014","accessionNumber":"14823029","dateOfInsertion":"18 December 2014","conferenceDate":"9-11 Nov. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spectrum sharing with quality of service assurance in cognitive radio networks","confLoc":"Al Ain, United Arab Emirates","sourcePdf":"p116adam.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.03979S","chronDate":"9-11 Nov. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6973089","isNumber":"6985764","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6973089","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6985764","articleId":"6987573","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6987632,"authors":[{"name":"Globa Larysa","affiliation":["Information Telecommunication Networks Department, NTUU \u201cKPI\u201d, Kyiv, Ukraine"],"firstName":"Globa","lastName":"Larysa","id":"38016666100"},{"name":"Skulysh Mariia","affiliation":["Information Telecommunication Networks Department, NTUU \u201cKPI\u201d, Kyiv, Ukraine"],"firstName":"Skulysh","lastName":"Mariia","id":"37085348603"},{"name":"Pidgurska Tetiana","affiliation":["Information Telecommunication Networks Department, NTUU \u201cKPI\u201d, Kyiv, Ukraine"],"firstName":"Pidgurska","lastName":"Tetiana","id":"37085346880"},{"name":"Andrii Reverchuk","affiliation":["NVision Czech Republic, Prague, CZ"],"firstName":"Andrii","lastName":"Reverchuk","id":"37567598700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-4136-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-8038-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6987632","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":47},"abstract":"Qualitative online billing system performance is essential for cost-effective service providers.

After such a design is reached, safety measures are integrated to achieve a safety-related architecture. For this purpose a diagnostic unit will be implemented, consisting of hardware and software tests. Hardware tests are related to the control of the FPGA functionality. They are based on the integration of two existing methods to reach complete hardware test coverage. The software tests are used for a continuous testing of the whole system (this means testing the central processing unit, bus systems, peripherals and memory). Furthermore, a safety multiplexer is integrated with the task to turn off the current operating system (main system) and to turn on a redundant system when a failure is introduced via the diagnostic unit. The safety multiplexer has to give the permission to the redundant system to receive the outputs from the main system in a way that is free from faults. The microcontroller ColdFire is used as a basis, which provides numerous features for the control of various peripherals as well as the connection of various types of memory.","doi":"10.1109/BIHTEL.2014.6987642","publicationTitle":"2014 X International Symposium on Telecommunications (BIHTEL)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 X International Symposium on Telecommunications (BIHTEL)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6971977/6987620/06987642.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BIHTEL.2014.6987642","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6987620","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Approach to the development of an FPGA-based safety-related, complete communication computer system","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6987642","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 Oct. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6987642/","displayDocTitle":"Approach to the development of an FPGA-based safety-related, complete communication computer system","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","accessionNumber":"14822919","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6987642/","conferenceDate":"27-29 Oct. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"18 December 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Approach to the development of an FPGA-based safety-related, complete communication computer system","confLoc":"Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina","sourcePdf":"34.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054615S","chronDate":"27-29 Oct. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6971977","isNumber":"6987620","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6971977","xplore-issue":"6987620","articleId":"6987642","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6987643,"authors":[{"name":"Anastasia Semenova","affiliation":["Telecommunication systems department, National Research University of Electronic Technology, Moscow, Russia"],"firstName":"Anastasia","lastName":"Semenova","id":"37085515888"},{"name":"Andrey Tikhomirov","affiliation":["Telecommunication systems department, National Research University of Electronic Technology, Moscow, Russia"],"firstName":"Andrey","lastName":"Tikhomirov","id":"37085548148"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-4136-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-8038-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6987643","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":173},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Synchronization","Frequency synchronization","Bit error rate","Voltage-controlled oscillators","Phase locked loops","Integrated circuit modeling","Binary phase shift keying"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["AWGN channels","Doppler shift","error statistics","phase shift keying"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feedforward carrier estimation method","large Doppler shift","BPSK carrier synchronization","Costas loop feedback circuits","square-law","small frequency shift conditions","AWGN channel"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Carrier synchronization","Doppler shift","feedforward carrier estimation","PSK signals"]}],"abstract":"In the paper a new method based on feedforward carrier estimation circuit is described for BPSK carrier synchronization.

The UAV agents' architecture is the RNBC structure, considering that the collision avoidance, velocity control and attitude control are already implemented behaviors in this structure. The new high-level behaviors pursuit and evasion are introduced, describing the PEG and providing an appropriate reference velocity vector for the underlying layers of the RNBC structure of the pursuer and the evader, respectively. The reference velocities for the agents are determined by solving the pursuit-evasion problem in a game-theoretical manner, while collision avoidance behavior is implemented one level below. The repulsion force approach is used as collision avoidance technique and provides a velocity vector, which is added to the reference velocity vector of the upper level, if there is a collision risk. The resulting reference input is processed by the subjacent layers in the RNBC structure of the UAV. In simulations it is shown that this approach provides a collision-free pursuit-evasion between UAV agents with dynamic constraints in a general three-dimensional environment with previously unknown obstacles.","doi":"10.1109/ICCAS.2014.6987737","publicationTitle":"2014 14th International Conference on Control, Automation and Systems (ICCAS 2014)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 14th International Conference on Control, Automation and Systems (ICCAS 2014)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6971252/6987542/06987737.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCAS.2014.6987737","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6987542","startPage":"1175","endPage":"1180","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Pursuit and evasion in a recursive nested behavioral control structure for unmanned aerial vehicles","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6987737","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Pursuit and evasion in a recursive nested behavioral control structure for unmanned aerial vehicles","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-25 Oct. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6987737/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"22-25 Oct. 2014","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","accessionNumber":"14820712","dateOfInsertion":"18 December 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6987737/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Pursuit and evasion in a recursive nested behavioral control structure for unmanned aerial vehicles","confLoc":"Gyeonggi-do, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"FA033.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074252S","chronDate":"22-25 Oct. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6971252","isNumber":"6987542","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6971252","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6987542","articleId":"6987737","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Institute of Control, Robotics and Systems (ICROS)","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6987781,"authors":[{"name":"Sung Teak Cho","affiliation":["Department of Mechatronics Engineering, Chungnam National University, Daejeon, Korea"],"firstName":"Sung Teak","lastName":"Cho","id":"37085458722"},{"name":"Seul Jung","affiliation":["Department of Mechatronics Engineering, Chungnam National University, Daejeon, Korea"],"firstName":"Seul","lastName":"Jung","id":"37278071900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-8-9932-1507-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-8-9932-1506-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2093-7121"}],"articleNumber":"6987781","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":72},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Service robots","Educational institutions","Vehicles","Proposals","Navigation","Mobile robots"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cameras","educational institutions","electric vehicles","entertainment","image colour analysis","image sensors","mobile robots","robot vision","trajectory control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["robotic vehicle control","university campus touring","entertainment robotic vehicle navigation","fully autonomous techniques","semiautonomous line following task","line detection","camera","electric vehicle"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Line detection","line tracking","entertainment robot","vision","semi-autonomous navigation"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6987781","abstract":"This paper presents the navigation of an entertainment robotic vehicle that follows the line on the pavement.

(UAVs) have many applications and quickly gain popularity with the availability of low-cost micro aerial vehicles (MAVs). Robotics is a popular interdisciplinary education target as it involves understanding and collaboration of several disciplines. Thus, UAVs can serve as an ideal study platform. However, as robotics requires technical background, skills and initial efforts, it is commonly applied in long-term courses. In this paper we successfully exploit the opposite case of robotics in short-term education for students without background, in form of a one-day contest on automatic visual UAV navigation. We provide an extensive survey, and show that existing material and tools do not fit the task and lack in technical aspects. We introduce a novel open-source programming library that comprises programs to guide learning by experience and allow rapid development. It makes contributions to marker-based tracking, with a novel nested-marker design and accurate calibration parameters estimated from 14 Parrot AR.Drone 2.0 front cameras. We show a detailed discussion of the contest results, which represents an extensive user study regarding robotics in education and the effectiveness of the library.

Continuous hidden Markov models of knee flexion and extension are trained using autoregressive model coefficients of knee flexor and extensor electromyograms. The patient's intention of knee movement are recognized by the trained continuous hidden Markov models and the user's knee flexor and extensor electromyograms. The suggested method was applied to a knee joint rehabilitation robot for identifying the suggested classification method in real time. A nondisabled healthy subject wore the robot, and its knee joint was extended when the subject's intention was recognized as `Extension.' The robot's knee joint was bended when the subject's intention was recognized as `Flexion'. If the user's intention wasn't recognized as `Extension' nor `Flexion', the robot's knee joint was remained stationary. The robot had followed properly the subject's knee joint motor intention. As a result of hidden Markov model classification, the robot reflects the subject's intensions with the recognition delay shorter than 200 msec and the recognition rate of 94.23 %. The results show the suggested method has good potential as a bio-signal classification method for a motor rehabilitation robot.","doi":"10.1109/ICCAS.2014.6988022","publicationTitle":"2014 14th International Conference on Control, Automation and Systems (ICCAS 2014)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 14th International Conference on Control, Automation and Systems (ICCAS 2014)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6971252/6987542/06988022.pdf","startPage":"357","endPage":"360","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCAS.2014.6988022","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6987542","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Recognition delay and recognition rate of knee motor intention recognized by electromyogram and continuous hidden Markov model","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6988022","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-25 Oct. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6988022/","displayDocTitle":"Recognition delay and recognition rate of knee motor intention recognized by electromyogram and continuous hidden Markov model","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","accessionNumber":"14820787","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6988022/","conferenceDate":"22-25 Oct. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"18 December 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Recognition delay and recognition rate of knee motor intention recognized by electromyogram and continuous hidden Markov model","confLoc":"Gyeonggi-do, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"WP45.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06365S","chronDate":"22-25 Oct. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6971252","isNumber":"6987542","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6971252","xplore-issue":"6987542","articleId":"6988022","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Institute of Control, Robotics and Systems (ICROS)","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":6988072,"authors":[{"name":"J.W.

Compared to classic sliding manifold control (SMC), terminal sliding manifold control (TSMC) not only has robustness to system uncertainties but also finite system state convergence time. However, in sliding action, the system dynamics is a reduced-order dimension, thus losing the partial system dynamics, and the system performance deteriorates. For recovering incomplete system response, a terminal complex sliding manifold control (TCSMC) is designed to compensate the closed-loop system dynamics. However, the chatter still exists in TCSMC. For UPS inverter applications, the chatter causes high voltage harmonics. To lessen the chatter, the genetic algorithm (GA) is adopted to tune TCSMC's gains well. With the proposed controller, the output voltage of the UPS inverter yields the features of low distortion, and is insensitive to system uncertainties. Experimental results reveal that the proposed controller can achieve good system performance.","doi":"10.1109/IWCIA.2014.6988074","startPage":"41","endPage":"45","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 7th International Workshop on Computational Intelligence and Applications (IWCIA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6971975/6987717/06988074.pdf","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 7th International Workshop on Computational Intelligence and Applications (IWCIA)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IWCIA.2014.6988074","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6987717","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Genetic algorithm-based terminal complex sliding manifold controller for UPS inverter applications","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Inverters","Uninterruptible power systems","Genetic algorithms","Manifolds","Pulse width modulation","Voltage control","Nonlinear dynamical systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["closed loop systems","genetic algorithms","invertors","power system control","power system harmonics","robust control","uncertain systems","uninterruptible power supplies"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithm-based terminal complex sliding manifold controller","UPS inverter applications","TCSMC","finite system state convergence time","robustness","system uncertainties","reduced-order dimension","partial system dynamics","closed-loop system dynamics","chatter","voltage harmonics","system uncertainties"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["UPS inverter","finite system state convergence time","reduced-order dimension","terminal complex sliding manifold control (TCSMC)","genetic algorithm (GA)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6988074/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-8 Nov. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Genetic algorithm-based terminal complex sliding manifold controller for UPS inverter applications","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6988074/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"18 December 2014","conferenceDate":"7-8 Nov. 2014","accessionNumber":"14822890","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Genetic algorithm-based terminal complex sliding manifold controller for UPS inverter applications","confLoc":"Hiroshima, Japan","sourcePdf":"413.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.079437S","chronDate":"7-8 Nov. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6971975","isNumber":"6987717","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6971975","xplore-issue":"6987717","articleId":"6988074","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6988081,"authors":[{"name":"Takumi Ichimura","affiliation":["Department of Management and Systems, Prefecture University of Hiroshima, Hiroshima, Japan"],"firstName":"Takumi","lastName":"Ichimura","id":"37324274500"},{"name":"Kosuke Tanabe","affiliation":["NEC Solution Innovators, Ltd."],"firstName":"Kosuke","lastName":"Tanabe","id":"38666588300"},{"name":"Toshiyuki Yamashita","affiliation":["Department of Human Sciences, Tokyo Metropolitan University, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Toshiyuki","lastName":"Yamashita","id":"37334781800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-4770-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-4771-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1883-3977"}],"articleNumber":"6988081","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":60},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Recurrent neural networks","Mood","Neurons","Learning systems","Educational institutions","Indexes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["behavioural sciences computing","learning (artificial intelligence)","recurrent neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive learning method","personality trait based mood","mental state transition network","recurrent neural network","MSTN","human psychological responses","mental responses","emotion generating calculations method","EGC","profit sharing method","RNN","PS method","human delicate emotion"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Affective Learning","Mental State Transition Network","Emotion Generating Calculations","Recurrent Neural Network","Profit Sharing"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6988081","abstract":"Mental State Transition Network (MSTN) is a basic concept of approximating to human psychological and mental responses.

An emotion for sensor inputs to MSTN is calculated by EGC and the variance of emotion leads to the change of mental state, and then the sequence of states forms an episode. In order to learn the tendency of personality trait effectively, the ineffective rules should be removed from the episode. PS method finds out a detour in episode and should be deleted.

optimization of neural networks and training data selection method for prediction","abstract":"The neural networks are well known as that they have an ability of approximation of any nonlinear function, and they are applied for data prediction in many fields. The parameters of neural networks, the thresholds and the weights between nodes, are updated by using given data. The performance of a neural network, for example prediction accuracy, is evaluated by the degree of the amount of the prediction error for multiple kinds of unknown data. To increase the performance, the appropriate structure of the neural network should be determined including the parameters. Cross-validation is one solution for this problem, and it is often applied in the existing literature. Through the cross-validation, the neural network may minimize not only error for the data for training, but also any unknown data, in other words, the neural network obtains generality capability by using cross-validation. The training data and the performance verification data are randomly selected in the procedure of the cross-validation, therefore, this paper proposes another method for the selection. In particular, the given data is mapped on 2 dimensional surface by using SOM(Self-Organization Map), and the mapped data are clustered into k clusters by using k-means method. From each cluster, certain fraction of the data are selected as the training data, and the rest data are selected as the performance verification data. Additionally, the proposed method includes the structural optimization method of a feedforward neural network consists of 4 layers, an input layer, a dimensional compressing layer, a hidden layer, and an output layer, by using tabu search. From the experimental result, it is observed that the appropriate structure of neural networks are obtained by using the proposed method.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-8 Nov. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6988101/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"14822899","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6988101/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"18 December 2014","conferenceDate":"7-8 Nov. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Structural optimization of neural networks and training data selection method for prediction","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Structural optimization of neural networks and training data selection method for prediction","confLoc":"Hiroshima, Japan","sourcePdf":"448.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051107S","chronDate":"7-8 Nov. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6971975","isNumber":"6987717","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6971975","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6987717","articleId":"6988101","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6988126,"authors":[{"name":"Huang Jiaoying","affiliation":["School of Reliability and System Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Huang","lastName":"Jiaoying","id":"37085360375"},{"name":"Hu Zhenyi","affiliation":["School of Reliability and System Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Hu","lastName":"Zhenyi","id":"37085386554"},{"name":"Gao Cheng","affiliation":["School of Reliability and System Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Gao","lastName":"Cheng","id":"37085340788"},{"name":"Cui Can","affiliation":["School of Reliability and System Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Cui","lastName":"Can","id":"37078468500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7958-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-7957-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-563X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-5656"}],"articleNumber":"6988126","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":162},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of water vapor control and passive layer process effecting on transistor performance and aluminum corrosion","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 Prognostics and System Health Management Conference (PHM-2014 Hunan)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6971856/6988116/06988126.pdf","startPage":"26","endPage":"30","publicationTitle":"2014 Prognostics and System Health Management Conference (PHM-2014 Hunan)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PHM.2014.6988126","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6988116","doi":"10.1109/PHM.2014.6988126","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Corrosion","Aluminum","Leakage currents","Transistors","Atmosphere","Temperature measurement","Water pollution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["aluminium","artificial satellites","bipolar transistors","corrosion","failure analysis","moisture control","semiconductor device metallisation","semiconductor device reliability","space vehicle electronics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["passive layer protection","NPN switching transistor","weather water vapor control","satellite power system","switch transistor","bipolar junction transistors","aluminum corrosion","transistor performance","passive layer process","Al"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["water vapor","passive layer","corrosion","corrosion mechanism","temperature cycling"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6988126","abstract":"Bipolar junction transistors can be used as switch transistors in satellite power system.

Interconnect Resources testing is one of the most important parts of FPGA testing since that most of the faults occur on Interconnect Resources. FPGA needs to be configured as specified circuits before being tested and conventional HDL-based configuration can not achieve controllability of the resources to be tested. In order to solve this problem, we propose a XDL-based configuration. In this paper, grammar and design flow of XDL were analyzed firstly. Then structure of interconnect resources of Xilinx Spartan-3 FPGA and their description using XDL were studied. According to the structure of the interconnect resources, a BIST structure was built to implement the test of them. Through C++ programming, we got XDL programs automatically. With four configurations, we implemented the testing of hex lines across CLBs and not across CLBs as well as double line across CLBs and not across CLBs. The method could solve the problem of uncontrollability of the resources to be tested efficiently.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6988164/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-27 Aug. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"Aug. 2014","accessionNumber":"14821065","htmlLink":"/document/6988164/","dateOfInsertion":"18 December 2014","conferenceDate":"24-27 Aug. 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A method of FPGA interconnect resources testing by using XDL-based configuration","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A method of FPGA interconnect resources testing by using XDL-based configuration","confLoc":"Zhangjiajie, China","sourcePdf":"044P0155.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043378S","chronDate":"24-27 Aug. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6971856","isNumber":"6988116","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6971856","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6988116","articleId":"6988164","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6988187,"authors":[{"name":"Zhou Zhicai","affiliation":["Qingdao Oil Detection and Analysis Center, Naval University of Engineering, Qingdao, China"],"firstName":"Zhou","lastName":"Zhicai","id":"37085393307"},{"name":"Liu Dongfeng","affiliation":["Qingdao Oil Detection and Analysis Center, Naval University of Engineering, Qingdao, China"],"firstName":"Liu","lastName":"Dongfeng","id":"37085398716"},{"name":"Shi Xinfa","affiliation":["Qingdao Oil Detection and Analysis Center, Naval University of Engineering, Qingdao, China"],"firstName":"Shi","lastName":"Xinfa","id":"37085383866"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7958-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-7957-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-563X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-5656"}],"articleNumber":"6988187","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":297},"abstract":"For fault prognosis process historical data is not complete, such problems as lack of prior knowledge, a combination of data-driven and probability-base prognostics method is proposed.

The approach is based on characteristic parameter data and particle swarm optimization non-homogenous grey model (PSO-NGM). Taking the Buck-Boost converter circuit as an example, the fault prediction of power electronic circuits is achieved. Firstly, it is an optimal choice to select the output voltage as monitoring signal, and then extracte the average voltage and ripple voltage of history and the current time as characteristic parameters. Additionally, PSO-NGM algorithm is used to predict the future characteristic parameters. Finally, fault prediction of power electronic circuits is achieved by comparing the predictive characteristic parameters with the threshold value. The experimental results indicate that the PSO-NGM algorithm is especially accurate in predicting the average voltage and ripple voltage with a error less than 0.3% and 1.3% respectively, which is ideal for fault prediction. The new method can trace the characteristic parameters' trend and can be effectively applied in fault prediction of power electronic circuits.","doi":"10.1109/PHM.2014.6988188","startPage":"327","endPage":"331","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 Prognostics and System Health Management Conference (PHM-2014 Hunan)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6971856/6988116/06988188.pdf","publicationTitle":"2014 Prognostics and System Health Management Conference (PHM-2014 Hunan)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PHM.2014.6988188","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6988116","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Research on fault prediction method of power electronic circuits based on particle swarm optimization non-homogenous grey model","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Circuit faults","Integrated circuit modeling","Predictive models","Power electronics","Monitoring","Data models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["grey systems","particle swarm optimisation","power convertors","power electronics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["particle swarm optimization","nonhomogenous grey model","PSO-NGM algorithm","power electronic circuit fault prediction","fault prediction technique","buck-boost converter circuit","fault prediction method"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["power electronic circuits","fault prediction","characteristic parameter","particle swarm optimization non-homogenous grey model"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6988188/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-27 Aug. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Research on fault prediction method of power electronic circuits based on particle swarm optimization non-homogenous grey model","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6988188/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"18 December 2014","conferenceDate":"24-27 Aug. 2014","accessionNumber":"14821054","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Research on fault prediction method of power electronic circuits based on particle swarm optimization non-homogenous grey model","confLoc":"Zhangjiajie, China","sourcePdf":"068P0120.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070197S","chronDate":"24-27 Aug. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6971856","isNumber":"6988116","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6971856","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6988116","articleId":"6988188","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":6988254,"authors":[{"name":"Nantian Wang","affiliation":["Science and Technology on Integrated Logistics Support Laboratory, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, P.

The graph theory based descriptions of the circuit function and the Embryonics' structure provide a mathematic foundation for design automation, which could push Embryonics' application effectively.","doi":"10.1109/PHM.2014.6988254","publicationTitle":"2014 Prognostics and System Health Management Conference (PHM-2014 Hunan)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 Prognostics and System Health Management Conference (PHM-2014 Hunan)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6971856/6988116/06988254.pdf","startPage":"653","endPage":"657","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PHM.2014.6988254","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6988116","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design method for a multi-layer bio-inspired self-healing hardware","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6988254","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-27 Aug. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6988254/","displayDocTitle":"Design method for a multi-layer bio-inspired self-healing hardware","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2014","accessionNumber":"14820988","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6988254/","conferenceDate":"24-27 Aug. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"18 December 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design method for a multi-layer bio-inspired self-healing hardware","confLoc":"Zhangjiajie, China","sourcePdf":"134P0169.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.079487S","chronDate":"24-27 Aug. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6971856","isNumber":"6988116","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6971856","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6988116","articleId":"6988254","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":6989217,"authors":[{"name":"Michael Steinke","affiliation":["Centrefor Quentum Engineering and Spece-Time Research - QUEST, Germany","Laser Zentrum Hannover e. v, Germany"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Steinke","id":"37074557800"},{"name":"Dietmar Kracht","affiliation":["Centrefor Quentum Engineering and Spece-Time Research - QUEST, Germany","Laser Zentrum Hannover e. v, Germany"],"firstName":"Dietmar","lastName":"Kracht","id":"37284007000"},{"name":"J\u00f6rg Neumann","affiliation":["Centrefor Quentum Engineering and Spece-Time Research - QUEST, Germany","Laser Zentrum Hannover e. v, Germany"],"firstName":"J\u00f6rg","lastName":"Neumann","id":"37542855500"},{"name":"Peter Wessels","affiliation":["Centrefor Quentum Engineering and Spece-Time Research - QUEST, Germany","Laser Zentrum Hannover e. v, Germany"],"firstName":"Peter","lastName":"Wessels","id":"37720948500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-55752-999-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2160-8989"}],"articleNumber":"6989217","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":57},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6989217","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optical variables measurement","Optical coupling","Optical pumping"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplification","erbium","optical fibre amplifiers","optical transfer function","ytterbium"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["gain dynamics","Er:Yb co-doped fiber amplifiers","transfer functions"]}],"abstract":"Gain dynamics of Er:Yb fiber amplifiers were studied analytically and corresponding transfer functions were measured, showing good agreement with the theoretical treatment.
