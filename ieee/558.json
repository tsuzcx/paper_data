Since narrowband sensing techniques only concentrate on one band at a time with prefixed band locations and bandwidth, wideband sensing is relatively more efficient. Considering the adverse effects of shadowing and multipath fading, in this paper, a cooperative wideband spectrum sensing algorithm based on the subspace method is proposed to detect the presence of a number of primary users in the band of interest. Specifically based on the collected samples of the received signals over multiple antennas, each secondary user estimates the number of primary user signals and their carrier frequencies using the subspace method. Before fusing all local estimates, the fusion center needs to determine which estimates belong to which primary users. The \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">k</i>\n -means algorithm built on the minimum description length principle is proposed for the data association problem, which can further eliminate false alarms. A linear unbiased estimator is proposed for data fusion and it reduces to a weighted sum of local estimates that belong to the same primary user. Experiments are conducted to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed algorithm in detecting the correct number of primary users and estimating their carrier frequencies.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSEN.2010.2052800","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5697312","startPage":"611","endPage":"620","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","pdfPath":"/iel5/7361/5697312/05580003.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Subspace-Based Cooperative Spectrum Sensing for Cognitive Radios","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5580003/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 September 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5580003/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Subspace-Based Cooperative Spectrum Sensing for Cognitive Radios","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2011","accessionNumber":"11775127","dateOfInsertion":"24 January 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"11","issue":"3","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Subspace-Based Cooperative Spectrum Sensing for Cognitive Radios","sourcePdf":"jsen-cheng-2052800-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.066765S","chronDate":"March  2011","xplore-pub-id":"7361","isNumber":"5697312","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7361","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"5697312","articleId":"5580003","onlineDate":"20 September 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5580007,"authors":[{"name":"Feng Liang","affiliation":["School of Electronic Information, Wuhan University of China, Wuhan, China","Institute of Applied Physics, School of Physical Electronics, University of Electronic Science and Technology, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Feng","lastName":"Liang","id":"37532308900"},{"name":"Gaofeng Wang","affiliation":["School of Electronic Information, Wuhan University of China, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Gaofeng","lastName":"Wang","id":"37291646900"},{"name":"Hai Lin","affiliation":["College of Physical Science and Technology, Huazhong Normal University, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Hai","lastName":"Lin","id":"37537497700"},{"name":"Bing-Zhong Wang","affiliation":["School of Physical Electronics, University of Electronic Science and Technology, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Bing-Zhong","lastName":"Wang","id":"37280506100"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1531-1309"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-1764"}],"articleNumber":"5580007","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":745},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society","url":"http://www.mtt.org/"}],"abstract":"A consistent implementation of Mur first-order absorbing boundary condition (ABC) for three-step 3-D locally 1-D finite-difference time- domain (LOD-FDTD) method is presented.

By using generative models to derive the features, state-of-the-art model-based compensation schemes can be used to make the system robust to noise. Previous work in this area is extended in two important directions. First, a large margin training of sentence-level log linear models is proposed for automatic speech recognition (ASR). This form of model is shown to be similar to the recently proposed structured Support Vector Machines (SVM). Second, based on the designed joint features, efficient lattice-based training and decoding are performed. This novel model combines generative kernels, discriminative models, efficient lattice-based large margin training and model-based noise compensation.

Monitoring physiological signals while driving provides the possibility of detecting and warning of drowsiness and fatigue. The aim of this paper is to maximize the amount of drowsiness-related information extracted from a set of electroencephalogram (EEG), electrooculogram (EOG), and electrocardiogram (ECG) signals during a simulation driving test. Specifically, we develop an efficient fuzzy mutual-information (MI)- based wavelet packet transform (FMIWPT) feature-extraction method for classifying the driver drowsiness state into one of predefined drowsiness levels. The proposed method estimates the required MI using a novel approach based on fuzzy memberships providing an accurate-information content-estimation measure. The quality of the extracted features was assessed on datasets collected from 31 drivers on a simulation test. The experimental results proved the significance of FMIWPT in extracting features that highly correlate with the different drowsiness levels achieving a classification accuracy of 95%-97% on an average across all subjects.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5580017/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 September 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"58","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"17 December 2010","accessionNumber":"11698321","htmlLink":"/document/5580017/","pubMedId":"20858575","displayDocTitle":"Driver Drowsiness Classification Using Fuzzy Wavelet-Packet-Based Feature-Extraction Algorithm","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Driver Drowsiness Classification Using Fuzzy Wavelet-Packet-Based Feature-Extraction Algorithm","sourcePdf":"tbme-khushaba-2077291-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.140569S","chronDate":"Jan.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"10","isNumber":"5672100","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"292","xplore-issue":"5672100","articleId":"5580017","onlineDate":"20 September 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5580020,"authors":[{"name":"Tom\u00e1s Brandao","affiliation":["Instituto de Telecomunica\u00e7\u00f5es, Lisbon, Portugal","Department of Technology and Information Sciences, ISCTE-Lisbon University Institute, Lisbon, Portugal"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/76/5621670/5580020/5580020-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Tom\u00e1s Brand\u00e3o (S'10) was born in Lisbon, Portugal in 1975.

The proposed metric comprises two main steps: coding error estimation and perceptual weighting of this error. Error estimates are computed in the transform domain, assuming that discrete cosine transform (DCT) coefficients are corrupted by quantization noise. The DCT coefficient distributions are modeled using Cauchy or Laplace probability density functions, whose parameterization is performed using the quantized coefficient data and quantization steps. Parameter estimation is based on a maximum-likelihood estimation method combined with linear prediction. The linear prediction scheme takes advantage of the correlation between parameter values at neighbor DCT spatial frequencies. As for the perceptual weighting module, it is based on a spatiotemporal contrast sensitivity function applied to the DCT domain that compensates image plane movement by considering the movements of the human eye, namely smooth pursuit, natural drift, and saccadic movements. The video related inputs for the perceptual model are the motion vectors and the frame rate, which are also extracted from the encoded video. Subjective video quality assessment tests have been carried out in order to validate the results of the metric. A set of 11 video sequences, spanning a wide range of content, have been encoded at different bitrates and the outcome was subject to quality evaluation. Results show that the quality scores computed by the proposed algorithm are well correlated with the mean opinion scores associated to the subjective assessment.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSVT.2010.2077474","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5621670","startPage":"1437","endPage":"1447","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/76/5621670/05580020.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"No-Reference Quality Assessment of H.264/AVC Encoded Video","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5580020/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 September 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5580020/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"No-Reference Quality Assessment of H.264/AVC Encoded Video","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2010","accessionNumber":"11629519","dateOfInsertion":"04 November 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"20","issue":"11","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"No-Reference Quality Assessment of H.264/AVC Encoded Video","sourcePdf":"tcsvt-brandao-2077474-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.083742S","chronDate":"Nov.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"76","isNumber":"5621670","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"66","xplore-issue":"5621670","articleId":"5580020","onlineDate":"20 September 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5580021,"authors":[{"name":"Yan Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Maryland, College Park, MD, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/76/5599342/5580021/5580021-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yan Chen (S'06) received the Bachelors degree from the University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, Anhui, China, in 2004, and the M.Phil. degree from the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Clear Water Bay, Hong Kong, in 2007.

To address this problem and achieve better streaming performance, we propose to enable cooperation among \u201cgroup peers,\u201d which are geographically neighboring peers with large intra-group upload and download bandwidths. Considering the peers' selfish nature, we formulate the cooperative streaming problem as an evolutionary game and derive, for every peer, the evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS), which is the stable Nash equilibrium and no one will deviate from. Moreover, we propose a simple and distributed learning algorithm for the peers to converge to the ESSs. With the proposed algorithm, each peer decides whether to be an agent who downloads data from the peers outside the group or a free-rider who downloads data from the agents by simply tossing a coin, where the probability of being a head for the coin is learned from the peer's own past payoff history. Simulation results show that the strategy of a peer converges to the ESS. Compared to the traditional non-cooperative P2P schemes, the proposed cooperative scheme achieves much better performance in terms of social welfare, probability of real-time streaming, and video quality (source rate).","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5580021/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 September 2010","volume":"20","issue":"10","accessionNumber":"11575409","publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5580021/","dateOfInsertion":"11 October 2010","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Cooperative peer-to-peer streaming: An evolutionary game-theoretic approach","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cooperative peer-to-peer streaming: An evolutionary game-theoretic approach","sourcePdf":"tcsvt-chen-2077490-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.085751S","chronDate":"Oct.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"76","isNumber":"5599342","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"38","xplore-issue":"5599342","articleId":"5580021","onlineDate":"20 September 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5580022,"authors":[{"name":"Guan-Lin Wu","affiliation":["Graduate Institute of Electronics Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/76/5621670/5580022/5580022-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Guan-Lin Wu received the B.S. degree from the Department of Electrical Engineering, National Cheng-Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan, and the M.S. degree from the Graduate Institute of Electronics Engineering (GIEE), National Taiwan University (NTU), Taipei, Taiwan, in 2003 and 2005, respectively.

Moreover, hardware architecture design and chip implementation of the proposed error concealment algorithm are also presented. For spatial error concealment, a mode selection algorithm considering the reuse of intra mode information embedded in bitstream is developed for the adaptation of bilinear and directional interpolation. It suffers only 0.08 dB video quality drop in average but the speedup measured on a general purpose processor is up to 40 times compared with the conventional methods. It is also more suitable for low cost hardware design. For temporal error concealment, the decoded motion vectors of the neighboring blocks of the corrupted macroblock are reused to provide hints to estimate the motion vector of the corrupted macroblock. Moreover, for real-time applications, a data and computational results reuse scheme of motion vector estimation is proposed and 96% computation and memory bandwidth can be reduced compared with the conventional methods with 0.18 dB quality drop in average.

We propose a method for coding the lengths of variable-length data blocks based on the error-resilient entropy coding (EREC). The idea is converting the problem of coding VLB lengths into the problem of coding the number of blank bits in fixed-length EREC slots. We give the upper bound of side information (SI) cost. To combat error propagation in SI bits, we rearrange SI bits into EREC structure. Detailed decoder design is given, which reveals that the proposed algorithm simplifies EREC decoder design by decomposing the decoder into three serially concatenated components.

This method is composed of three steps. The first step is preprocessing to construct 2-D Fourier transform images and initial polar-mapped images. In this step, two RD images are 2-D Fourier transformed to avoid the necessity of finding the rotation center; then, the transformed images are polar mapped with identical polar grids to convert rotation into translation in the \u03b8-direction only. The second step is a coarse search that finds the angular shift that provides the maximum correlation between two polar images. The angular shift found is used as the initial relative rotation angle (RA), and the initial relative scaling factor (RSF) is calculated using the RV which is equal to the angular shift divided by the time delay between the images. The third step is the optimization of the relative RA using the Nelder-Mead approach, with the RSF updated using the relative RA derived during each iteration. In simulations using a Mig-25 aircraft, composed of ideal point scatterers, and the measured data from a Boeing 747-400, the targets were properly rescaled in the range-cross-range domain due to the accurate estimation of the RV.","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2010.2060731","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel5/36/5695081/05580049.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2010.2060731","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5695081","startPage":"868","endPage":"877","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cross-Range Scaling Algorithm for ISAR Images Using 2-D Fourier Transform and Polar Mapping","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5580049","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Cross-Range Scaling Algorithm for ISAR Images Using 2-D Fourier Transform and Polar Mapping","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5580049/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 September 2010","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"49","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 2011","accessionNumber":"11769604","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5580049/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cross-Range Scaling Algorithm for ISAR Images Using 2-D Fourier Transform and Polar Mapping","sourcePdf":"tgrs-kim-2060731-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.09722S","chronDate":"Feb.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"5695081","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"43","xplore-issue":"5695081","articleId":"5580049","onlineDate":"20 September 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5580052,"authors":[{"name":"Yueqin Huang","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Technology, Xiamen University, Xiamen, China","Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Duke University, Durham, NC, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/36/5695081/5580052/5580052-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yueqin Huang received the B.S. degree in communication engineering from Jimei University, Xiamen, China, in 2005.

In this method, an irregular cell discretization scheme is used to accurately describe arbitrarily undulant interfaces in a model. The ray tracing is carried out by forward-backward processing. In the forward step, the travel time in an irregular cell is expressed in terms of the bilinear interpolation of the known travel times on the cell's surfaces. Then, the wavefront is evolved from the source to the whole computational domain by using the newly developed travel-time solver and the fast wavefront expansion GMM. In the backward step, each ray path is traced from the receiver by finding the intersection points of potential ray propagation vectors with the surfaces of the relevant cells. The same travel-time solver is used to compute the candidate intersection points on all surfaces of each relevant cell, and the point with the minimum travel time is selected as a ray point from which the similar step is continued until the sources are found. Several numerical experiments are presented to demonstrate that the new algorithm is accurate, efficient, and robust.","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2010.2061856","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel5/36/5695081/05580052.pdf","startPage":"679","endPage":"687","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2010.2061856","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5695081","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Three-Dimensional GPR Ray Tracing Based on Wavefront Expansion With Irregular Cells","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5580052","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 September 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5580052/","displayDocTitle":"Three-Dimensional GPR Ray Tracing Based on Wavefront Expansion With Irregular Cells","volume":"49","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 2011","accessionNumber":"11769608","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5580052/","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Three-Dimensional GPR Ray Tracing Based on Wavefront Expansion With Irregular Cells","sourcePdf":"tgrs-zhang-2061856-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.084061S","chronDate":"Feb.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"5695081","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"5695081","articleId":"5580052","onlineDate":"20 September 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5580062,"authors":[{"name":"Rong Zhang","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA"],"firstName":"Rong","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37575290300"},{"name":"Mary L.

Theoretical performance functions are derived based on RD theory and quantization noise modeling. We assume the base layer is encoded by a non-scalable coder. The coding efficiency of the enhancement (enh.) layer, measured by the signal-to-noise ratio, is determined by the input video power spectral density, the motion estimation error distribution, and the base layer encoder rate. Numerical evaluations of the performance functions show that, compared to independent motion-compensated prediction encoding of the enh. layer, the inter-layer pyramid and subband methods are expected to be more efficient if the base layer is encoded at a sufficiently high quality or the motion estimation accuracy is relatively low in the enh. layer. Results from real video data encoding show that the presented theoretical analysis can be very useful to understand the efficiencies of these spatial scalability techniques.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Rate Distortion Performance of Pyramid and Subband Motion Compensation Based on Quantization Theory","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","doi":"10.1109/TCSVT.2010.2077478","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/76/5704816/05580062.pdf","startPage":"1876","endPage":"1881","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSVT.2010.2077478","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5704816","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5580062","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5580062/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 September 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2010","displayDocTitle":"Rate Distortion Performance of Pyramid and Subband Motion Compensation Based on Quantization Theory","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"20","issue":"12","dateOfInsertion":"31 January 2011","publicationDate":"Dec. 2010","accessionNumber":"12086582","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Rate Distortion Performance of Pyramid and Subband Motion Compensation Based on Quantization Theory","sourcePdf":"tcsvt-zhang-2077478-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039221S","chronDate":"Dec.  2010","isNumber":"5704816","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"3","articleId":"5580062","onlineDate":"20 September 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5580064,"authors":[{"name":"Liangchun C.

The metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS)-controlled power devices are the most favorable structure; however, it is widely believed that silicon oxide on SiC is physically limited, particularly at high temperatures. Therefore, experimental measurements of long-term reliability of oxide at high temperatures are necessary. In this paper, time-dependent dielectric-breakdown measurements are performed on state-of-the-art 4H-SiC MOS capacitors and double-implanted MOS field-effect transistors (DMOSFET) with stress temperatures between 225\u00b0C and 375\u00b0C and stress electric fields between 6 and 10 MV/cm. The field-acceleration factor is around 1.5 dec/(MV/cm) for all of the temperatures. The thermal activation energy is found to be ~ 0.9 eV, independent of the electric field. The area dependence of Weibull slope is discussed and shown to be a possible indication that the oxide quality has not reached the intrinsic regime and further oxide-reliability improvements are possible. Since our reliability data contradict the widely accepted belief that silicon oxide on SiC is fundamentally limited by its smaller conduction-band offset compared with Si, a detailed discussion is provided to examine the arguments of the early predictions.","doi":"10.1109/TDMR.2010.2077295","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TDMR.2010.2077295","startPage":"418","endPage":"426","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Device and Materials Reliability","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Device and Materials Reliability","pdfPath":"/iel5/7298/5703169/05580064.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5703169","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reliability Issues of SiC MOSFETs: A Technology for High-Temperature Environments","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5580064/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 September 2010","displayDocTitle":"Reliability Issues of SiC MOSFETs: A Technology for High-Temperature Environments","volume":"10","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"28 January 2011","accessionNumber":"11775401","publicationDate":"Dec. 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5580064/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reliability Issues of SiC MOSFETs: A Technology for High-Temperature Environments","sourcePdf":"tdmr-yu-2077295-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.083797S","chronDate":"Dec.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"7298","isNumber":"5703169","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7298","citationCount":"140","xplore-issue":"5703169","articleId":"5580064","onlineDate":"20 September 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-23"},{"_id":5580078,"authors":[{"name":"Chin-Pang Liu","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London, London, UK"],"bio":{"p":["Chin-Pang Liu (M'10) received the First-Class B.Eng.

Traditional solutions using wavelength division multiplexing or even deploying multiple optical fibers are, however, far too expensive for this particular application. We propose and demonstrate transmission of three MIMO radio signals all with a 11-MSymb/s, 16 quadrature amplitude modulation, and 2.44-GHz carrier frequency over an optical fiber using a novel single-sideband frequency-translation technique. The maximum crosstalk level between the different MIMO channels was . Compared with sub-carrier multiplexing, where transmitting three such signals would require frequency shifting two of them using two separate local oscillators (LOs), the new technique requires only a single low-frequency LO. This novel technique can be implemented in add-on modules to work with existing commercially available radio-over-fiber systems, which were not originally designed to carry such MIMO signals having the same frequency.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel5/22/5629952/05580078.pdf","startPage":"3094","endPage":"3102","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.2010.2074510","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.2010.2074510","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5629952","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5580078","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Transmission of Wireless MIMO-Type Signals Over a Single Optical Fiber Without WDM","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Amplitude modulation","Wireless communication","Frequency modulation","Optical fibers","Optical modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO communication","quadrature amplitude modulation","radio-over-fibre","wavelength division multiplexing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wireless MIMO-type signals","single optical fiber","WDM","multiple wireless signals","multiple-input-multiple-output signals","IEEE 802.11n standard","wavelength division multiplexing","multiple optical fibers","quadrature amplitude modulation","single-sideband frequency-translation technique","maximum crosstalk level","MIMO channels","local oscillators","radio-over-fiber systems","frequency 2.44 GHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Microwave photonics","modulation","multiple input multiple output (MIMO)","radio-over-fiber (ROF)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5580078/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 September 2010","displayDocTitle":"Transmission of Wireless MIMO-Type Signals Over a Single Optical Fiber Without WDM","volume":"58","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/5580078/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2010","accessionNumber":"11638639","dateOfInsertion":"11 November 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Transmission of Wireless MIMO-Type Signals Over a Single Optical Fiber Without WDM","sourcePdf":"tmtt-liu-2074510-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.051839S","chronDate":"Nov.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"5629952","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"32","xplore-issue":"5629952","articleId":"5580078","onlineDate":"20 September 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5580079,"authors":[{"name":"Ping Xu","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Illinois Institute of Technology, Chicago, IL, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/90/5750164/5580079/5580079-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ping Xu (S'07) received the B.Eng. and M.E. degrees in electronic engineering from Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China, in 2003 and 2006, respectively, and is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree in computer science at the Illinois Institute of Technology, Chicago.","He also worked on cognitive radio networks as a Summer Intern with Microsoft Research Asia, Beijing, China, in 2008.

One challenge is that the spectrum usage requests often come in an online fashion.

In this paper, we address these two challenges by proposing TOFU, a semi-truthful online frequency allocation method for wireless networks when primary users can sublease the spectrums to secondary users. In our protocol, secondary users are required to submit the spectrum bid \u03b1 time slots before its usage. Upon receiving an online spectrum request, our protocol will decide whether to grant its exclusive usage or not, within at least \u03b3 time slots of requests' arrival. We assume that existing spectrum usage can be preempted with some compensation. For various possible known information, we analytically prove that the competitive ratios of our methods are within small constant factors of the optimum online method. Furthermore, in our mechanisms, no selfish users will gain benefits by bidding lower than their willing payment. Our extensive simulation results show that they perform almost optimum: Our methods get a total profit that is more than 95% of the offline optimum when \u03b3 is about the duration of spectrum usage \u0394.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNET.2010.2067223","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5750164","startPage":"433","endPage":"446","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","pdfPath":"/iel5/90/5750164/05580079.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"TOFU: Semi-Truthful Online Frequency Allocation Mechanism for Wireless Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5580079/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 September 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5580079/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"TOFU: Semi-Truthful Online Frequency Allocation Mechanism for Wireless Networks","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2011","accessionNumber":"11960317","dateOfInsertion":"15 April 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"19","issue":"2","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"TOFU: Semi-Truthful Online Frequency Allocation Mechanism for Wireless Networks","sourcePdf":"tnet-li-2067223-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.112414S","chronDate":"April  2011","xplore-pub-id":"90","isNumber":"5750164","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"90","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"5750164","articleId":"5580079","onlineDate":"20 September 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5580081,"authors":[{"name":"Daniel Le Ly","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, USA","Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/72/5617343/5580081/5580081-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Daniel Le Ly (S'09) received the B.A.Sc. degree with honors in engineering science and the M.A.Sc. degree in computer engineering from the University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada, in 2008 and 2009, respectively.

A primary cause for this lack of adoption is that neural networks are usually implemented as software running on general-purpose processors. Hence, a hardware implementation that can exploit the inherent parallelism in neural networks is desired. This paper investigates how the restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM), which is a popular type of neural network, can be mapped to a high-performance hardware architecture on field-programmable gate array (FPGA) platforms. The proposed modular framework is designed to reduce the time complexity of the computations through heavily customized hardware engines. A method to partition large RBMs into smaller congruent components is also presented, allowing the distribution of one RBM across multiple FPGA resources. The framework is tested on a platform of four Xilinx Virtex II-Pro XC2VP70 FPGAs running at 100 MHz through a variety of different configurations. The maximum performance was obtained by instantiating an RBM of 256 256 nodes distributed across four FPGAs, which resulted in a computational speed of 3.13 billion connection-updates-per-second and a speedup of 145-fold over an optimized C program running on a 2.8-GHz Intel processor.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hardware","Computer architecture","Field programmable gate arrays","Program processors","Equations","Complexity theory","Artificial neural networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Boltzmann machines","C language","computational complexity","field programmable gate arrays","reconfigurable architectures"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high-performance reconfigurable hardware architecture","restricted Boltzmann machines","neural networks","general-purpose processors","field-programmable gate array platforms","time complexity","Xilinx Virtex II-Pro XC2VP70 FPGA","C program","Intel processor"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Boltzmann machines","computer architecture","field-programmable gate arrays","neural network hardware","parallel processing"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Artificial Intelligence","Computer Simulation","Computers","Computers","Neural Networks (Computer)","Programming Languages","Software Validation"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5580081","doi":"10.1109/TNN.2010.2073481","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/72/5617343/05580081.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNN.2010.2073481","startPage":"1780","endPage":"1792","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5617343","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High-Performance Reconfigurable Hardware Architecture for Restricted Boltzmann Machines","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"High-Performance Reconfigurable Hardware Architecture for Restricted Boltzmann Machines","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5580081/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 September 2010","volume":"21","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/5580081/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"01 November 2010","publicationDate":"Nov. 2010","accessionNumber":"11623353","pubMedId":"20858578","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High-Performance Reconfigurable Hardware Architecture for Restricted Boltzmann Machines","sourcePdf":"tnn-ly-2073481-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.117403S","chronDate":"Nov.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"72","isNumber":"5617343","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"39","xplore-issue":"5617343","articleId":"5580081","onlineDate":"20 September 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-24"},{"_id":5580086,"authors":[{"name":"Dan M.

Finite-element analysis (FEA) is employed only for calculating the magnetic vector potential in the coils, and the motor performance is then estimated through analytical formulas. For the example interior-permanent-magnet motors presented, as little as one magnetostatic finite-element (FE) solution was used for the fundamental flux linkage and average torque computation. Two FE solutions were employed for the core flux density waveforms and power loss estimation. A minimum of three solutions is recommended for the torque ripple, back electromotive force, and induced voltage. A substantial reduction of one to two orders of magnitude was achieved for the solving time as compared with the detailed time-stepping FEA. The surrogate FE model can also be tuned for increased speed, comparable with that of magnetic equivalent circuit solvers. The general applicability of the model is discussed, and recommendations are provided. Successful validation was performed against the detailed FEA and experiments.","doi":"10.1109/TIA.2010.2073671","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/28/5639224/05580086.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIA.2010.2073671","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5639224","startPage":"2424","endPage":"2433","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Finite-Element Surrogate Model for Electric Machines With Revolving Field\u2014Application to IPM Motors","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5580086","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Finite-Element Surrogate Model for Electric Machines With Revolving Field\u2014Application to IPM Motors","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.-Dec.  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5580086/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 September 2010","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"46","issue":"6","publicationDate":"Nov.-Dec. 2010","accessionNumber":"11655444","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5580086/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Finite-Element Surrogate Model for Electric Machines With Revolving Field\u2014Application to IPM Motors","sourcePdf":"tia-popescu-2073671-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.086549S","chronDate":"Nov.-Dec.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"28","isNumber":"5639224","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"28","citationCount":"51","xplore-issue":"5639224","articleId":"5580086","onlineDate":"20 September 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5580090,"authors":[{"name":"Xavier Perpina","affiliation":["Institut de Microelectr\u00f3nica de Barcelona IMB-CNM, Universitat Aut\u00f2noma Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/5873561/5580090/5580090-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Xavier Perpi\u00f1\u00e0 was born in Almenar, Spain, in 1976.

Results show that mismatches in the electrothermal properties of the IGBT device during transient operation can lead to uneven power dissipation, significantly enhancing the risk of failure and reducing the lifetime of the power module.

Our method is based on a rigorous consistency checking principle of physical characteristics among different arbitrarily shaped image regions. In this paper, we specifically study the camera response function (CRF), a fundamental property in cameras mapping input irradiance to output image intensity. A test image is first automatically segmented into distinct arbitrarily shaped regions. One CRF is estimated from each region using geometric invariants from locally planar irradiance points (LPIPs). To classify a boundary segment between two regions as authentic or spliced, CRF-based cross fitting and local image features are computed and fed to statistical classifiers. Such segment level scores are further fused to infer the image level authenticity. Tests on two data sets reach performance levels of 70% precision and 70% recall, showing promising potential for real-world applications. Moreover, we examine individual features and discover the key factor in splicing detection. Our experiments show that the anomaly introduced around splicing boundaries plays the major role in detecting splicing. Such finding is important for designing effective and efficient solutions to image splicing detection.","doi":"10.1109/TIFS.2010.2077628","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5623286","startPage":"816","endPage":"825","pdfPath":"/iel5/10206/5623286/05580092.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIFS.2010.2077628","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Camera Response Functions for Image Forensics: An Automatic Algorithm for Splicing Detection","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cameras","Splicing","Image segmentation","Estimation","Charge coupled devices","Image color analysis","Brightness"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cameras","computer forensics","image classification","image coding","image segmentation","statistical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["camera response functions","image forensics","automatic algorithm","image splicing detection","doctored digital image detection","cameras mapping input irradiance","image segmentation","geometric invariants","locally planar irradiance points","CRF-based cross fitting","statistical classifiers"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Camera response function (CRF)","image forensics","splicing detection","tampering detection"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2010","displayDocTitle":"Camera Response Functions for Image Forensics: An Automatic Algorithm for Splicing Detection","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5580092/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 September 2010","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"5","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/5580092/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"11641620","publicationDate":"Dec. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Camera Response Functions for Image Forensics: An Automatic Algorithm for Splicing Detection","sourcePdf":"tifs-hsu-2077628-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.074364S","chronDate":"Dec.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"10206","isNumber":"5623286","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10206","citationCount":"55","xplore-issue":"5623286","articleId":"5580092","onlineDate":"20 September 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":5580094,"authors":[{"name":"Tommaso Cucinotta","affiliation":["Real-Time Systems Laboratory, Scuola Superiore Sant'' Anna, Pisa, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/9424/5605856/5580094/5580094-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Tommaso Cucinotta received the degree in computer engineering from the University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy, in 2000, and the Ph.D. degree in computer engineering from Scuola Superiore Sant'Anna (SSSA), Pisa, Italy, in 2004, with a thesis titled Issues in authentication by means of smart-card devices.","He is currently an Assistant Professor at Scuola Superiore S.

Each application can execute in different modes, each one associated with a level of Quality-of-Service (QoS). Resources, in their turn, have different modes, each one with a speed and a power consumption, and are managed by a Reservation-Based scheduler enabling a dynamic allocation of the fraction of resources (bandwidth) assigned to each application. To cope with dynamic changes of the application, we advocate an adaptive resource allocation policy organized in two nested feedback loops. The internal loop operates on the scheduling parameter to obtain a resource allocation that meets the temporal constraints of the applications. The external loop operates on the QoS level of the applications and on the power level of the resources to strike a good tradeoff between the global QoS and the energy consumption. This loop comes into play whenever the workload of the application exceeds the bounds that permit the internal loop to operate correctly, or whenever it decreases below a level that permit more aggressive choices for the QoS or substantial energy saving.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5580094/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 September 2010","volume":"6","issue":"4","accessionNumber":"11629733","publicationDate":"Nov. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5580094/","dateOfInsertion":"04 November 2010","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"On the Integration of Application Level and Resource Level QoS Control for Real-Time Applications","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Integration of Application Level and Resource Level QoS Control for Real-Time Applications","sourcePdf":"tii-cucinotta-2072962-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.112092S","chronDate":"Nov.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"9424","isNumber":"5605856","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9424","citationCount":"32","xplore-issue":"5605856","articleId":"5580094","onlineDate":"20 September 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5580097,"authors":[{"name":"Ra\u00fal Vicen-Bueno","affiliation":["Signal Theory and Communications Department, Superior Polytechnic School, University of Alcal\u00e1, Madrid, Spain"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/19/5609237/5580097/5580097-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ra\u00fal Vicen-Bueno received the B.Eng. degree in electrical technical engineering and the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from the University of Alcal\u00e1, Madrid, Spain, in 2000 and 2002, respectively.","From 2000 to 2002, he was an R&D Communications Engineer with INDRA.

To be effective, action learning should not be limited to direct replication of movements obtained during training but must also enable the generation of actions in situations a robot has never encountered before. This paper describes a methodology that enables the generalization of the available sensorimotor knowledge. New actions are synthesized by the application of statistical methods, where the goal and other characteristics of an action are utilized as queries to create a suitable control policy, taking into account the current state of the world. Nonlinear dynamic systems are employed as a motor representation. The proposed approach enables the generation of a wide range of policies without requiring an expert to modify the underlying representations to account for different task-specific features and perceptual feedback. The paper also demonstrates that the proposed methodology can be integrated with an active vision system of a humanoid robot. 3-D vision data are used to provide query points for statistical generalization. While 3-D vision on humanoid robots with complex oculomotor systems is often difficult due to the modeling uncertainties, we show that these uncertainties can be accounted for by the proposed approach.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics","pdfPath":"/iel5/8860/5592139/05580104.pdf","startPage":"800","endPage":"815","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics","doi":"10.1109/TRO.2010.2065430","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TRO.2010.2065430","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5592139","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5580104","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Task-Specific Generalization of Discrete and Periodic Dynamic Movement Primitives","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Trajectory","Robots","Training","Equations","Mathematical model","Hidden Markov models","Databases"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["humanoid robots","knowledge representation","motion estimation","nonlinear dynamical systems","robot vision","statistical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["task specific generalization","discrete dynamic movement primitive","periodic dynamic movement primitive","sensorimotor knowledge","robot learning","action learning","statistical method","nonlinear dynamic system","motor representation","task specific feature","perceptual feedback","vision system","humanoid robot","3-D vision data","statistical generalization","oculomotor system"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Active vision on humanoid robots","humanoid robots","imitation learning","learning and adaptive systems"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5580104/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 September 2010","displayDocTitle":"Task-Specific Generalization of Discrete and Periodic Dynamic Movement Primitives","volume":"26","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/5580104/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11559815","dateOfInsertion":"30 September 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Task-Specific Generalization of Discrete and Periodic Dynamic Movement Primitives","sourcePdf":"tro-ude-2065430-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.096316S","chronDate":"Oct.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"8860","isNumber":"5592139","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8860","citationCount":"225","xplore-issue":"5592139","articleId":"5580104","onlineDate":"20 September 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":5580105,"authors":[{"name":"Ya-Li Hou","affiliation":["Industrial Automation Research Laboratory Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/3468/5624826/5580105/5580105-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ya-Li Hou (S'09) received the B.Eng. degree in electronic engineering and information science from the University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China, in 2004, and the Master degree from the Shanghai Institute of Technical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China, in 2007.

In recent years, the field has seen many advances, but the solutions have restrictions: people must be moving, the background must be simple, and the image resolution must be high. This paper aims to develop an effective method for estimating the number of people and locate each individual in a low resolution image with complicated scenes. The contribution of this paper is threefold. First, postprocessing steps are performed on background subtraction results to estimate the number of people in a complicated scene, which includes people who are moving only slightly. Second, an Expectation Maximization (EM)-based method has been developed to locate individuals in a low resolution scene. In this method, a new cluster model is used to represent each person in the scene. The method does not require a very accurate foreground contour. Third, the number of people is used as a priori for locating individuals based on feature points. Hence, the methods for estimating the number of people and for locating individuals are connected. The developed methods have been validated based on a 4-hour video, with the number of people in the scene ranging from 36 to 222. The best result for estimating the number of people has an average error of 10% over 51 test cases. Based on the estimated number of people, some results of the EM-based method have also been shown.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5580105/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 September 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"41","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"09 November 2010","accessionNumber":"11630124","htmlLink":"/document/5580105/","displayDocTitle":"People Counting and Human Detection in a Challenging Situation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"People Counting and Human Detection in a Challenging Situation","sourcePdf":"tsmca-hou-2064299-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.06522S","chronDate":"Jan.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"3468","isNumber":"5624826","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3468","citationCount":"149","xplore-issue":"5624826","articleId":"5580105","onlineDate":"20 September 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-09"},{"_id":5580107,"authors":[{"name":"Batu Krishna Chalise","affiliation":["Center of Advanced Communications, Villanova University, Villanova, PA, USA","Universit\u00e9 Catholique de Louvain, Belgium"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/5621048/5580107/5580107-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Batu Krishna Chalise (S\u201903\u2013M\u201906) was born in Kathmandu, Nepal.

Assuming that the knowledge of the second order statistics of the channels such as covariance matrices are available, the multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) relays are designed using two different methods: (1) minimize the sum of the powers of the relays while fulfilling the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) requirements for all destinations and (2) maximize the minimum of the SINRs of all destinations satisfying the transmit power constraint of each MIMO relay. Furthermore, considering the fact that the covariance matrices of the channels between the MIMO relays and destinations are subject to uncertainty due to feedback and quantization errors, the robust versions of the aforementioned methods based on worst-case concept are proposed. It is shown that the proposed nonrobust as well as robust designs are nonconvex optimization problems but they can be solved accurately and efficiently using the standard semidefinite relaxation and randomization techniques. Computer simulations verify the improved performance of the robust designs over nonrobust methods.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/5621048/05580107.pdf","startPage":"6355","endPage":"6368","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2010.2077632","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2010.2077632","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5621048","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5580107","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimization of MIMO Relays for Multipoint-to-Multipoint Communications: Nonrobust and Robust Designs","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","MIMO","Robustness","Channel estimation","Covariance matrix","Quality of service","Interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","concave programming","covariance matrices","MIMO communication","radio links","relays","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO relays optimization","multipoint-to-multipoint communication","nonrobust designs","robust designs","multiple multiantenna relays","wireless networks","second order statistics","covariance matrices","multiple input multiple output relays","signal-to-interference plus noise ratio","transmit power constraint","quantization errors","nonconvex optimization","standard semidefinite relaxation","randomization techniques"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Channel state information","channel uncertainty and convex optimization","robust MIMO relays","worst-case performance optimization"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5580107/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 September 2010","displayDocTitle":"Optimization of MIMO Relays for Multipoint-to-Multipoint Communications: Nonrobust and Robust Designs","volume":"58","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/5580107/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2010","accessionNumber":"11641775","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimization of MIMO Relays for Multipoint-to-Multipoint Communications: Nonrobust and Robust Designs","sourcePdf":"tsp-chalise-2077632-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.133611S","chronDate":"Dec.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"5621048","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"70","xplore-issue":"5621048","articleId":"5580107","onlineDate":"20 September 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5580109,"authors":[{"name":"Sagnik Ghosh","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California, San Diego, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/5621048/5580109/5580109-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Sagnik Ghosh received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering and computer sciences from the University of California, Berkeley, in 2006.

Since CDI changes infrequently compared to channel state information (CSI), algorithms based on CDI can achieve significant savings in feedback compared to algorithms based on CSI. With CDI, we can only guarantee quality of service for a specified outage probability in the network. Assuming correlated Rayleigh fading on all the links, we derive a closed-form expression for the outage probability. Then, using this expression, we derive algorithms for joint transmit/receive beamforming and power control to minimize the weighted sum power in the network while guaranteeing these outage probabilities. For both single-user and multiuser MIMO scenarios, we present optimal algorithms under the Kronecker model assumption, and we present near-optimal algorithms assuming general correlation structures on the links. We then show that using these algorithms based on CDI, if we are willing to accept given outages on the links, we can achieve comparable power usage in the network relative to algorithms based on CSI.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/5621048/05580109.pdf","startPage":"6312","endPage":"6324","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2010.2077285","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2010.2077285","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5621048","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5580109","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Outage-Efficient Strategies for Multiuser MIMO Networks With Channel Distribution Information","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference","MIMO","Signal to noise ratio","Optimization","Array signal processing","Random variables","Rayleigh channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","MIMO communication","multiuser channels","probability","quality of service","Rayleigh channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO","channel distribution information","multiple input multiple output","multiuser beamforming networks","CDI","CSI","channel state information","quality of service","outage probability","Rayleigh fading","power control"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Beamformers","channel distribution information (CDI)","channel state information (CSI)","covariance feedback","multi user MIMO","outage probability"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5580109/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 September 2010","displayDocTitle":"Outage-Efficient Strategies for Multiuser MIMO Networks With Channel Distribution Information","volume":"58","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/5580109/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2010","accessionNumber":"11641779","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Outage-Efficient Strategies for Multiuser MIMO Networks With Channel Distribution Information","sourcePdf":"tsp-ghosh-2077285-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.081133S","chronDate":"Dec.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"5621048","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"5621048","articleId":"5580109","onlineDate":"20 September 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5580113,"authors":[{"name":"Amitav Mukherjee","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of California, Irvine, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/5662471/5580113/5580113-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Amitav Mukherjee (S'06) received the B.S. degree from the University of Kansas, Lawrence, in 2005 and the M.S. degree from Wichita State University, Wichita, KS, in 2007, both in electrical engineering.

In particular, we focus on the judicious transmission of artificial interference to mask the desired signal at the time it is broadcast. Unlike previous work that assumes some prior knowledge of the eavesdropper's channel and focuses on maximizing secrecy capacity, we consider the case where no information regarding the eavesdropper is available, and we use signal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio (SINR) as our performance metric. Specifically, we focus on the problem of maximizing the amount of power available to broadcast a jamming signal intended to hide the desired signal from a potential eavesdropper, while maintaining a prespecified SINR at the desired receiver. The jamming signal is designed to be orthogonal to the information signal when it reaches the desired receiver, assuming both the receiver and the eavesdropper employ optimal beamformers and possess exact channel state information (CSI). In practice, the assumption of perfect CSI at the transmitter is often difficult to justify. Therefore, we also study the resulting performance degradation due to the presence of imperfect CSI, and we present robust beamforming schemes that recover a large fraction of the performance in the perfect CSI case. Numerical simulations verify our analytical performance predictions, and illustrate the benefit of the robust beamforming schemes.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5580113/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 September 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2011","volume":"59","issue":"1","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11704194","dateOfInsertion":"17 December 2010","publicationDate":"Jan. 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5580113/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Robust Beamforming for Security in MIMO Wiretap Channels With Imperfect CSI","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust Beamforming for Security in MIMO Wiretap Channels With Imperfect CSI","sourcePdf":"tsp-mukherjee-2078810-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.074495S","chronDate":"Jan.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"5662471","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"325","xplore-issue":"5662471","articleId":"5580113","onlineDate":"20 September 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5580116,"authors":[{"name":"Bogdan M.

This strategy is ruled by imposing a certain modulation index in one of the two bridges and a phase shift between the transformer primary and secondary voltages. Moreover, the proposed algorithm reduces the reactive power and thus reducing the converter conduction losses. An experimental prototype was implemented and some experimental results are presented to validate the theoretical analysis. The experimental results reveal that the overall efficiency of the DAB topology can be improved up to 20% by implementing the proposed modulation strategy instead of the conventional one.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5580124/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 September 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2011","volume":"26","issue":"4","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12047681","dateOfInsertion":"09 June 2011","publicationDate":"April 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5580124/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Modulation strategy to operate the dual active bridge DC-DC converter under soft switching in the whole operating range","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modulation strategy to operate the dual active bridge DC-DC converter under soft switching in the whole operating range","sourcePdf":"tpel-oggier-2072966-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.113379S","chronDate":"April  2011","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"5871429","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"300","xplore-issue":"5871429","articleId":"5580124","onlineDate":"20 September 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-23"},{"_id":5580125,"authors":[{"name":"Xuehua Wang","affiliation":["College of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/5675792/5580125/5580125-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Xuehua Wang was born in Hubei Province, China, in 1978.

However, the current distortion caused by harmonics in the grid voltage is difficult to be eliminated. Increasing the loop gain can reduce the current distortion, but this approach is compromised by the system stability requirement. Without increasing the loop gain, applying feedforward of the grid voltage can suppress the effect of grid voltage harmonics. This paper proposes the feedforward function of the grid voltage for the grid-connected inverter with an LCL filter. Specifically, the proposed feedforward function involves proportional, derivative, and second derivative of the grid voltage, and can be simplified according to the dominant harmonics in the grid voltage. The proposed feedforward scheme can effectively suppress the current distortion arising from the grid voltage harmonics, and the steady-state error of the injected current can be substantially reduced even if a conventional proportional and integral regulator is applied. A 6-kW experimental prototype has been tested to verify the effectiveness of the proposed feedforward scheme.","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2010.2077312","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/63/5675792/05580125.pdf","startPage":"3119","endPage":"3127","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2010.2077312","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5675792","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Full Feedforward of Grid Voltage for Grid-Connected Inverter With LCL Filter to Suppress Current Distortion Due to Grid Voltage Harmonics","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5580125","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 September 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5580125/","displayDocTitle":"Full Feedforward of Grid Voltage for Grid-Connected Inverter With LCL Filter to Suppress Current Distortion Due to Grid Voltage Harmonics","volume":"25","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 2010","accessionNumber":"11758960","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5580125/","dateOfInsertion":"17 January 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Full Feedforward of Grid Voltage for Grid-Connected Inverter With LCL Filter to Suppress Current Distortion Due to Grid Voltage Harmonics","sourcePdf":"tpel-wang-2077312-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.071472S","chronDate":"Dec.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"5675792","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"236","xplore-issue":"5675792","articleId":"5580125","onlineDate":"20 September 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5580130,"authors":[{"name":"Mohammed F.

The CB average beampattern shows a deterministic behavior and the mainlobe of the CB sample beampattern is independent of the particular node locations. However, the CB for a cluster of a finite number of collaborative nodes results in a sample beampattern with sidelobes that severely depend on the particular node locations. High level sidelobes can cause unacceptable interference when they occur at directions of unintended BSs/APs. Therefore, sidelobe control in CB has a potential to decrease the interference at unintended BSs/APs and increase the network transmission rate by enabling simultaneous multilink CB. Traditional sidelobe control techniques are proposed for centralized antenna arrays and are not suitable for WSNs. In this paper, we show that scalable and low-complexity sidelobe control techniques suitable for CB in WSNs can be developed based on a node selection technique which makes use of the randomness of the node locations. A node selection algorithm with low-rate feedback is developed to search over different node combinations. The performance of the proposed algorithm is analyzed in terms of the average number of search trials required for selecting the collaborative nodes, the resulting interference, and the corresponding transmission rate improvements. Our simulation results show that the interference can be significantly reduced and the transmission rate can be significantly increased when node selection is implemented with CB. The simulation results also show close agreement with our theoretical results.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5580130/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 September 2010","volume":"58","issue":"12","accessionNumber":"11641784","publicationDate":"Dec. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5580130/","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2010","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Sidelobe Control in Collaborative Beamforming via Node Selection","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sidelobe Control in Collaborative Beamforming via Node Selection","sourcePdf":"tsp-vorobyov-2077631-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.086849S","chronDate":"Dec.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"5621048","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"46","xplore-issue":"5621048","articleId":"5580130","onlineDate":"20 September 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-02"},{"_id":5580131,"authors":[{"name":"Tao Wang","affiliation":["Communications and Remote Sensing Laboratory, Institute of Information and Communication Technologies, Electronics and Applied Mathematics, Universit\u00e9 Catholique de Louvain, Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgium"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/5662471/5580131/5580131-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Tao Wang received the B.E.

We address the problem of maximizing the weighted sum of the minimal user rates (WSMR) of coordinated cells subject to a total power constraint at each BS, in terms of jointly optimizing coordinated BSs' subcarrier and power allocation. In particular, the solution of this problem corresponds to a resource allocation that guarantees similar rates to all users in each cell. An iterative algorithm is proposed to optimize the subcarrier allocation and the power allocation alternatively, so that the WSMR keeps increasing until convergence. In each iteration, the subcarrier allocation is updated by solving a mixed integer linear program for each cell, while the power allocation is updated by solving a successive set of convex optimization problems with a duality-based numerical algorithm. The effectiveness of the algorithm is illustrated by numerical experiments.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Iterative Resource Allocation for Maximizing Weighted Sum Min-Rate in Downlink Cellular OFDMA Systems","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2010.2078811","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/5662471/05580131.pdf","startPage":"223","endPage":"234","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2010.2078811","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5662471","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5580131","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5580131/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 September 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2011","displayDocTitle":"Iterative Resource Allocation for Maximizing Weighted Sum Min-Rate in Downlink Cellular OFDMA Systems","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"59","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/5580131/","dateOfInsertion":"17 December 2010","publicationDate":"Jan. 2011","accessionNumber":"11704200","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Iterative Resource Allocation for Maximizing Weighted Sum Min-Rate in Downlink Cellular OFDMA Systems","sourcePdf":"tsp-wang-2078811-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.155717S","chronDate":"Jan.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"5662471","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"93","xplore-issue":"5662471","articleId":"5580131","onlineDate":"20 September 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5580133,"authors":[{"name":"Hassan Mostafa","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Hassan","lastName":"Mostafa","id":"37403004900"},{"name":"M.

The derived model is verified and compared to Monte Carlo simulations by using industrial hardware-calibrated 65-nm CMOS technology. This paper shows the impact of the coupling capacitor, one of the most common soft error mitigation techniques, on the critical charge variability. It demonstrates that the adoption of the coupling capacitor reduces the critical charge variability.

The key idea is to use stochastic methods to quickly locate near-optimal solutions in designing FPGA routing architectures without exhaustively enumerating all design points. The main objective of this paper is not as much about the specific numerical results obtained, as it is to show the applicability and effectiveness of the proposed optimization approach. To demonstrate the utility of the proposed stochastic approach, we developed the tool for optimizing routing architecture (TORCH) software based on the versatile place and route tool. Given FPGA architecture parameters and a set of benchmark designs, TORCH simultaneously optimizes the routing channel segmentation and switch box patterns using the performance metric of average interconnect power-delay product estimated from placed and routed benchmark designs. Special techniques - such as incremental routing, infrequent placement, multi-modal move selection, and parallelized metric evaluation - are developed to reduce the overall run time and improve the quality of results. Our experimental results have shown that the stochastic design strategy is quite effective in co-optimizing both routing channel segmentation and switch patterns. With the optimized routing architecture, relative to the performance of our chosen architecture baseline, TORCH can achieve average improvements of 24% and 15% in delay and power consumption for the 20 largest Microelectronics Center of North Carolina benchmark designs, and 27% and 21% for the eight benchmark designs synthesized with the Altera Quartus II University Interface Program tool. Additionally, we found that the average segment length in an FPGA routing channel should decrease with technology scaling. Finally, we demonstrate the versatility of TORCH by illustrating how TORCH can be used to optimize other aspects of the routing architecture in an FPGA.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Switches","Routing","Field programmable gate arrays","Delay","Computer architecture","Benchmark testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","network routing","stochastic processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FPGA routing architecture","field-programmable gate array","stochastic methods","tool for optimizing routing architecture software","versatile place","route tool","routing channel segmentation","switch box patterns","average interconnect power-delay product","incremental routing","infrequent placement","multimodal move selection","parallelized metric evaluation","Altera Quartus II University interface program tool"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Design exploration","FPGA","routing architecture","stochastic"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5580223","doi":"10.1109/TCAD.2010.2061530","startPage":"1509","endPage":"1522","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/43/5580212/05580223.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5580212","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCAD.2010.2061530","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 September 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5580223/","displayDocTitle":"Exploring FPGA Routing Architecture Stochastically","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2010","volume":"29","issue":"10","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"20 September 2010","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"11534194","htmlLink":"/document/5580223/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Exploring FPGA Routing Architecture Stochastically","sourcePdf":"tcad-lin-2061530-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.107778S","chronDate":"Oct.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"43","isNumber":"5580212","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5580212","articleId":"5580223","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5580226,"authors":[{"name":"Tsu-Wei Tseng","affiliation":["Advanced Reliable Systems (ARES) Laboratory, Department of Electrical Engineering, National Central University, Jhongli, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/43/5580212/5580226/5580226-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Tsu-Wei Tseng received the B.S. degree from the Department of Electronic Engineering, Fu-Jen Catholic University, Hsinchuang, Taiwan, in 2003.

Fault-location ability of test algorithms executed by a BISR circuit has heavy impact on the repair efficiency of the BISR circuit. This paper proposes a defect-aware BISR (DABISR) scheme for single-port RAMs (SPRAMs) and multi-port RAMs (MPRAMs) in system chips. Multiple RAMs can share a DABISR such that the area cost of DABISR is drastically reduced. We also present two defect-location algorithms (DLAs) for identification of bridge defects between word-lines and bit-lines of MPRAMs. The DABISR can perform DLAs to locate bridge defects such that it can provide high repair efficiency. For example, simulation results show that if a faulty two-port RAM has 20% inter-port faults, the DLAs can help to gain 8.4-14.4% increase of repair rate for different redundancy configurations. In comparison with an existing shared BISR scheme, however, the DABISR only incurs about 0.34% additional area overhead to support the function of DLAs.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5580226/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 September 2010","volume":"29","issue":"10","accessionNumber":"11534190","publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5580226/","dateOfInsertion":"20 September 2010","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"DABISR: A Defect-Aware Built-In Self-Repair Scheme for Single/Multi-Port RAMs in SoCs","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"DABISR: A Defect-Aware Built-In Self-Repair Scheme for Single/Multi-Port RAMs in SoCs","sourcePdf":"tcad-li-2061570-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.142888S","chronDate":"Oct.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"43","isNumber":"5580212","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"5580212","articleId":"5580226","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5580227,"authors":[{"name":"Wooyoung Jang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Technology, Austin, TX, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/43/5580212/5580227/5580227-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Wooyoung Jang (S'08) received the B.E. degree in radio science and technology from Kyung Hee University, Suwon, South Korea, in 1998, and the M.S. degree in electrical and computer engineering from Yonsei University, Seoul, South Korea, in 2000.

SDRAM is commonly controlled by a memory subsystem that schedules memory requests to improve memory efficiency and latency. However, a memory subsystem is still a performance bottleneck in the entire NoC. Therefore, memory-aware NoC optimization has attracted considerable attention. This paper presents a NoC router with an explicit SDRAM-aware flow control. Based on priority-based arbitration, our SDRAM-aware flow controller schedules memory requests to prevent bank conflict, data contention, and short turn-around bank interleaving. Moreover, our multi-stage scheduling scheme further improves memory performance and saves NoC hardware costs. Experimental results show that our cost-efficient SDRAM-aware NoC design significantly improves memory latency and utilization compared to the conventional NoC design with no SDRAM-aware router.","doi":"10.1109/TCAD.2010.2061251","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/43/5580212/05580227.pdf","startPage":"1572","endPage":"1585","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5580212","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCAD.2010.2061251","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An SDRAM-Aware Router for Networks-on-Chip","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5580227","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2010","displayDocTitle":"An SDRAM-Aware Router for Networks-on-Chip","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5580227/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"20 September 2010","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"11534189","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5580227/","volume":"29","issue":"10","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 September 2010","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An SDRAM-Aware Router for Networks-on-Chip","sourcePdf":"tcad-jang-2061251-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.098715S","chronDate":"Oct.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"43","isNumber":"5580212","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"5580212","articleId":"5580227","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":5580288,"authors":[{"name":"Wojciech Kabaci\u0144ski","affiliation":["Communication and Computer Networks, Poznan University of Technology, Poznan, Poland"],"firstName":"Wojciech","lastName":"Kabaci\u0144ski","id":"37329013200"},{"name":"Marek Michalski","affiliation":["Communication and Computer Networks, Poznan University of Technology, Poznan, Poland"],"firstName":"Marek","lastName":"Michalski","id":"37274685400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6971-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6969-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6970-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2325-5552"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2325-5560"}],"articleNumber":"5580288","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":153},"abstract":"This paper presents a hardware implementation of a control algorithm for the log\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sub>\n(N, 0, p) switching fabric.

High-level abstract hardware-oriented parallel programming method can structurally bridge this gap. This paper proposes a first step toward such a method to efficiently implement Parallel 2-D MRI image filtering algorithms using the Xilinx system generator. The implementation method consists of five simple steps that provide fast FPGA prototyping for high performance computation to obtain excellent quality of results. The results are obtained for nine 2-D image filtering algorithms.

Then, one of the nine MRI image filtering algorithms, has empirically improved to generate an enhanced MRI image filtering with moderate lower power consumption at higher maximum frequency.","doi":"10.1109/CSNDSP16145.2010.5580315","publicationTitle":"2010 7th International Symposium on Communication Systems, Networks & Digital Signal Processing (CSNDSP 2010)","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 7th International Symposium on Communication Systems, Networks & Digital Signal Processing (CSNDSP 2010)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5564175/5580291/05580315.pdf","startPage":"765","endPage":"769","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5580291","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CSNDSP16145.2010.5580315","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance efficient FPGA implementation of parallel 2-D MRI image filtering algorithms using Xilinx system generator","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5580315/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 July 2010","displayDocTitle":"Performance efficient FPGA implementation of parallel 2-D MRI image filtering algorithms using Xilinx system generator","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5580315/","dateOfInsertion":"20 September 2010","publicationDate":"July 2010","accessionNumber":"11535395","conferenceDate":"21-23 July 2010","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance efficient FPGA implementation of parallel 2-D MRI image filtering algorithms using Xilinx system generator","confLoc":"Newcastle Upon Tyne, UK","sourcePdf":"SIP6.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.091292S","chronDate":"21-23 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5564175","isNumber":"5580291","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5564175","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5580291","articleId":"5580315","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":5580317,"authors":[{"name":"Mohamed M.

A test set of 550 lead I ECG traces recorded from 22 healthy individuals measured at different times are used to validate the system. The proposed system extracts special parts of the ECG signal starting from the QRS complex to the end of the T wave. Two different approaches are used to compensate for the change in the signal duration with the change in Heart Rate, By the first approach time domain normalization according to Framingham correction formula[1] is used. By the second approach the QT signal to a fixed length is applied. Finally the ability to use only the QRS complex for identification without any time domain manipulation has been investigated. Selected DCT coefficients obtained from the normalized signals were introduced to a Neural Network based classifier. Three methods are proposed which give identification rates ranging from 97.727 % to 99.09%.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5580291","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CSNDSP16145.2010.5580317","publicationTitle":"2010 7th International Symposium on Communication Systems, Networks & Digital Signal Processing (CSNDSP 2010)","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 7th International Symposium on Communication Systems, Networks & Digital Signal Processing (CSNDSP 2010)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5564175/5580291/05580317.pdf","startPage":"755","endPage":"759","doi":"10.1109/CSNDSP16145.2010.5580317","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Human identification using time normalized QT signal and the QRS complex of the ECG","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 July 2010","displayDocTitle":"Human identification using time normalized QT signal and the QRS complex of the ECG","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"21-23 July 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5580317/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2010","accessionNumber":"11535397","dateOfInsertion":"20 September 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5580317/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Human identification using time normalized QT signal and the QRS complex of the ECG","confLoc":"Newcastle Upon Tyne, UK","sourcePdf":"SIP4.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047392S","chronDate":"21-23 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5564175","isNumber":"5580291","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5564175","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"5580291","articleId":"5580317","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5580318,"authors":[{"name":"S.A.

Many biomarkers have been identified that appear to relate to the aggressive behaviour of cancer. However, the nonlinear relation of these markers to nodal status and also the existence of complex interaction between markers has prohibited an accurate prognosis. The aim of this paper is to investigate the effectiveness of a multilayer perceptron (MLP) for the aim of predicting breast cancer progression using a set of four biomarkers of breast tumours. A further objective of the study is to explore the predictive potential of these markers in defining the state of nodal involvement in breast cancer. Two methods of outcome evaluation viz. stratified and simple k-fold cross validation (CV) are also studied in order to assess their accuracy and reliability for neural network validation. We used output accuracy, sensitivity and specificity for selecting the best validation technique besides evaluating the network outcome for different combinations of markers. Findings suggest that ANN-based analysis provides an accurate and reliable platform for breast cancer prediction given that an appropriate design and validation method is employed.","doi":"10.1109/CSNDSP16145.2010.5580318","startPage":"760","endPage":"764","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 7th International Symposium on Communication Systems, Networks & Digital Signal Processing (CSNDSP 2010)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5564175/5580291/05580318.pdf","publicationTitle":"2010 7th International Symposium on Communication Systems, Networks & Digital Signal Processing (CSNDSP 2010)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CSNDSP16145.2010.5580318","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5580291","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Breast cancer prediction and cross validation using multilayer perceptron neural networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Classification algorithms","Guidelines","Predictive models","Prediction algorithms","Breast","Accuracy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomedical equipment","cancer","cellular biophysics","medical diagnostic computing","multilayer perceptrons","patient diagnosis","tumours"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["breast cancer prediction","multilayer perceptron neural networks","metastasis","regional lymph nodes","biomarkers","prognosis","breast tumours","k- fold cross validation","ANN-based analysis"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Breast cancer","k-fold cross validation","multilayer perceptron (MLP)","predictive analysis"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5580318/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 July 2010","displayDocTitle":"Breast cancer prediction and cross validation using multilayer perceptron neural networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5580318/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2010","dateOfInsertion":"20 September 2010","conferenceDate":"21-23 July 2010","accessionNumber":"11535398","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Breast cancer prediction and cross validation using multilayer perceptron neural networks","confLoc":"Newcastle Upon Tyne, UK","sourcePdf":"SIP5.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063176S","chronDate":"21-23 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5564175","isNumber":"5580291","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5564175","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5580291","articleId":"5580318","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5580334,"authors":[{"name":"N.

The simplest OCDMA scheme is based on the optical power and involves the use of unipolar temporal spreading code sequences. In this context, Multiple Access Interference (MAI) is the first inherent limitation. In addition, due to photodetection process, beatings between the different user contributions appear and degrade the performance. This limitation, known as beat noise, has a severe impact on the performance, depending on the optical to electrical bandwidth ratio. The study presented in this paper takes into account both limitations to evaluate the OCDMA system robustness using two main types of spreading codes having different cross correlation values: the OOC (Optical Orthogonal Codes) and the PC (Prime Codes). Beatings due to photodetection process are traduced by using a statistical chi-squared based signal distribution, which parameters depends on the OCDMA spreading code. Thanks to this statistical analysis, a theoretical error probability expression is determined. The code design under beat noise assumption is realized for several configurations and using different code families. The analysis highlights the interest of using PC instead of OOC for beat noise corrupted cases.","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 7th International Symposium on Communication Systems, Networks & Digital Signal Processing (CSNDSP 2010)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5564175/5580291/05580341.pdf","startPage":"636","endPage":"641","publicationTitle":"2010 7th International Symposium on Communication Systems, Networks & Digital Signal Processing (CSNDSP 2010)","doi":"10.1109/CSNDSP16145.2010.5580341","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CSNDSP16145.2010.5580341","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5580291","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5580341","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"OCDMA system performance with Prime Codes under beat noise constraints","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Noise","Adaptive optics","Optical noise","Correlation","Bit error rate","Error probability","Bandwidth"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","interference (signal)","optical communication","orthogonal codes","photodetectors","sequences","statistical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["OCDMA system","prime code","beat noise constraint","optical code division multiple access","temporal spreading code sequence","multiple access interference","photodetection","OOC","optical orthogonal code","statistical chi-squared based signal distribution"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5580341/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 July 2010","displayDocTitle":"OCDMA system performance with Prime Codes under beat noise constraints","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5580341/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2010","accessionNumber":"11535420","dateOfInsertion":"20 September 2010","conferenceDate":"21-23 July 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"OCDMA system performance with Prime Codes under beat noise constraints","confLoc":"Newcastle Upon Tyne, UK","sourcePdf":"PCSN3.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060601S","chronDate":"21-23 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5564175","isNumber":"5580291","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5564175","xplore-issue":"5580291","articleId":"5580341","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":5580355,"authors":[{"name":"H.Q.

The communication channel is modelled as a gamma-gamma channel. The analysis of the 2PolSK characteristics is based on the error performance in turbulence regimes from weak to strong.

In this paper, we discuss some key issues in practical line-of-sight (LOS) visible light communication system design. They include a transmitter, channel model, and receiver front-end. A transmitter containing white LED arrays should be designed to achieve required lighting distribution and reliable data transmission at the same time. A basic LOS channel model to characterize the path loss and received optical power is also needed for optimization of the receiver under major noise sources. Finally we show a practical indoor LOS visible light communication system to demonstrate some of our analyses.","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 7th International Symposium on Communication Systems, Networks & Digital Signal Processing (CSNDSP 2010)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5564175/5580291/05580360.pdf","startPage":"621","endPage":"625","publicationTitle":"2010 7th International Symposium on Communication Systems, Networks & Digital Signal Processing (CSNDSP 2010)","doi":"10.1109/CSNDSP16145.2010.5580360","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CSNDSP16145.2010.5580360","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5580291","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5580360","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Line-of-sight visible light communication system design and demonstration","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Light emitting diodes","Lighting","Optical filters","Optical transmitters","Noise","Optical receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","light emitting diodes","lighting","optical receivers","optical transmitters","telecommunication network reliability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["line-of-sight visible light communication system design","high lumen output white lighting LED","transmitter front-end","receiver front-end","white LED array","lighting distribution","reliable data transmission","LOS channel model","pre-equalization"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Visible light communication","line-of-sight","transmitter LED","pre-equalization","photodetector","noise","system performance"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5580360/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 July 2010","displayDocTitle":"Line-of-sight visible light communication system design and demonstration","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5580360/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2010","accessionNumber":"11535439","dateOfInsertion":"20 September 2010","conferenceDate":"21-23 July 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Line-of-sight visible light communication system design and demonstration","confLoc":"Newcastle Upon Tyne, UK","sourcePdf":"OWC21.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068761S","chronDate":"21-23 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5564175","isNumber":"5580291","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5564175","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"5580291","articleId":"5580360","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5580361,"authors":[{"name":"S.

Traffic shaping schemes have been applied to limit P2P traffic while reducing customer satisfaction and affecting the performance of other applications. As an alternative, in this work we propose the use of inexpensive free-space optical (FSO) links from ISPs to fibre backbones to accommodate latency-tolerant traffic including P2P and other bulk data transfers for backup and storage. For such classes of data traffic, the instantaneous reliability of the link is not the primary concern, rather the average throughput of the link is important. The average throughput and outage characteristics of an FSO link for latency-tolerant traffic are studied using weather data from a major Canadian city. Rather than previous studies which focus on improving the reliability of FSO links, this work considers different modulation techniques with the goal of achieving the highest average throughput for data traffic. For a 1 km link with a 1 ns symbol period, an average annual rate of nearly 1.5 Gbps is possible using 4-PAM modulation as opposed to an average rate of 880 Mbps for conventional on-off keying.","doi":"10.1109/CSNDSP16145.2010.5580365","publicationTitle":"2010 7th International Symposium on Communication Systems, Networks & Digital Signal Processing (CSNDSP 2010)","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 7th International Symposium on Communication Systems, Networks & Digital Signal Processing (CSNDSP 2010)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5564175/5580291/05580365.pdf","startPage":"588","endPage":"592","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CSNDSP16145.2010.5580365","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5580291","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the use of free-space optical links for latency-tolerant traffic applications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5580365","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 July 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5580365/","displayDocTitle":"On the use of free-space optical links for latency-tolerant traffic applications","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2010","accessionNumber":"11535444","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5580365/","conferenceDate":"21-23 July 2010","dateOfInsertion":"20 September 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the use of free-space optical links for latency-tolerant traffic applications","confLoc":"Newcastle Upon Tyne, UK","sourcePdf":"OWC15.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061082S","chronDate":"21-23 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5564175","isNumber":"5580291","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5564175","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5580291","articleId":"5580365","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5580368,"authors":[{"name":"Zeyu Wu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Boston University, Boston, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Zeyu","lastName":"Wu","id":"37633094900"},{"name":"Thomas Little","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Boston University, Boston, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Thomas","lastName":"Little","id":"37333851900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-86135-369-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8858-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5580368","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":514},"abstract":"Recent developments in solid-state light-emitting diode (LED) materials and devices is driving a resurgence into the use of free-space optics (FSO) for wireless broadband communication. This technology uses the visible spectrum provided by \u201cwhite\u201d LEDs that are becoming ubiquitous in lighting and has some desirable properties competitive with existing radio frequency (RF) communications. By leveraging the low-cost nature of LEDs and lighting units there are many opportunities to exploit this medium for widespread optical communication deployment. The optical medium, however, has particular characteristics, including directionality and susceptibility to noise sources in the visible spectrum that must be managed. In this paper we present a new indoor FSO system, also known as a visible light communication (VLC) system that addresses achieving satisfactory data rates while supporting multiple access under line of sight (LOS) constraints. A hexagonal physical device design is proposed and investigated in the context to two communication protocols designed to manage point-to-point and point-to-host cases. Theoretical analysis and simulation of the two protocols under the hexagonal transceiver device design indicate suitability for addressing high data rate communications between peer devices; or, via relay, between multiple devices using the peer-to-host model.","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 7th International Symposium on Communication Systems, Networks & Digital Signal Processing (CSNDSP 2010)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5564175/5580291/05580368.pdf","startPage":"582","endPage":"587","publicationTitle":"2010 7th International Symposium on Communication Systems, Networks & Digital Signal Processing (CSNDSP 2010)","doi":"10.1109/CSNDSP16145.2010.5580368","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CSNDSP16145.2010.5580368","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5580291","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5580368","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Network solutions for the LOS problem of new indoor free space optical system","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Peer to peer computing","Face","Routing protocols","Throughput","Lighting","Light emitting diodes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["indoor communication","light emitting diodes","optical communication equipment","protocols","transceivers","visible spectra"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["LOS problem","indoor free space optical system","solid-state light-emitting diode material","light-emitting diode device","wireless broadband communication","white LED","visible spectrum","widespread optical communication deployment","indoor FSO system","visible light communication","line of sight constraint","communication protocol","hexagonal transceiver device design"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Free Space Optics","Visible Light Communication"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5580368/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 July 2010","displayDocTitle":"Network solutions for the LOS problem of new indoor free space optical system","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5580368/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2010","accessionNumber":"11535447","dateOfInsertion":"20 September 2010","conferenceDate":"21-23 July 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Network solutions for the LOS problem of new indoor free space optical system","confLoc":"Newcastle Upon Tyne, UK","sourcePdf":"OWC14.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.093436S","chronDate":"21-23 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5564175","isNumber":"5580291","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5564175","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5580291","articleId":"5580368","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5580369,"authors":[{"name":"Raed Mesleh","affiliation":["Jacobs University Bremen, Bremen, Germany"],"firstName":"Raed","lastName":"Mesleh","id":"37296995700"},{"name":"Hany Elgala","affiliation":["Jacobs University Bremen gGmbH, Bremen, Bremen, DE"],"firstName":"Hany","lastName":"Elgala"},{"name":"Harald Haas","affiliation":["Institute for Digital Communications, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK","Jacobs University Bremen, Bremen, Germany"],"firstName":"Harald","lastName":"Haas","id":"37269894900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-86135-369-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8858-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5580369","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1269},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Light emitting diodes","Modulation","Wireless communication","Bit error rate","Bandwidth","AWGN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["AWGN channels","channel allocation","discrete cosine transforms","error statistics","indoor communication","light emitting diodes","OFDM modulation","pulse amplitude modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optical wireless communication","indoor communication","DMT","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","discrete multitone","subcarrier assignment","PAM","half-wave symmetry time signal","LED","discrete sine transform","discrete cosine transform","bit error ratio","additive white Gaussian noise channel","pulse amplitude modulation","asymmetrically clipped OFDM system","ACO","DC-biased"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Optical wireless communication","intensity modulation","direct detection","OFDM","DMT","PAM","ACO","DC-biased","LED nonlinearity"]}],"abstract":"This paper is an overview of indoor OFDM (orthogonal frequency division multiplexing)/DMT (discrete multitone) optical wireless (OW) communication systems. Indoor OW OFDM/DMT systems can be classified into two groups. One group produces half-wave symmetry time signal at the output of the OFDM modulator by special assignment of subcarriers. Thus, allowing signal clipping at the zero level and avoiding the need of DC bias at the expense of data rate reduction. ACOOFDM (asymmetrically clipped OFDM system) and PAM (pulse amplitude modulation)-DMT are two techniques from the first group. The second group assigns data to all possible subcarriers to increase the data rate. However, half-wave symmetry signals cannot be achieved and DC bias is needed to convert the bipolar signal to a unipolar signal before modulating the LED (light emitting diode) intensity. DC-biased OFDM and a novel technique, proposed in this paper, called orthogonal PAM-DMT (OPAM-DMT) that is an extension of the proposed PAM-DMT by using discrete sine transform and discrete cosine transform to transmit two orthogonal signals at the same time, are two techniques from the second group. This paper considerers a practical LED model and studies the performance of all these systems in terms of average electrical OFDM signal power versus bit-error-ratio (BER) in the presence of additive white Gaussian noise channel (AWGN). It is shown that LED clipping has significant impact on the performance of all these systems and the performance of these systems substantially depends on the considered modulation order.","doi":"10.1109/CSNDSP16145.2010.5580369","publicationTitle":"2010 7th International Symposium on Communication Systems, Networks & Digital Signal Processing (CSNDSP 2010)","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 7th International Symposium on Communication Systems, Networks & Digital Signal Processing (CSNDSP 2010)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5564175/5580291/05580369.pdf","startPage":"566","endPage":"570","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CSNDSP16145.2010.5580369","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5580291","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An overview of indoor OFDM/DMT optical wireless communication systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5580369","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 July 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5580369/","displayDocTitle":"An overview of indoor OFDM/DMT optical wireless communication systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2010","accessionNumber":"11535448","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5580369/","conferenceDate":"21-23 July 2010","dateOfInsertion":"20 September 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An overview of indoor OFDM/DMT optical wireless communication systems","confLoc":"Newcastle Upon Tyne, UK","sourcePdf":"OWC11.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069907S","chronDate":"21-23 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5564175","isNumber":"5580291","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5564175","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5580291","articleId":"5580369","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5580370,"authors":[{"name":"Waqar Hameed","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, University of Engineering and Technology, Lahore, Pakistan"],"firstName":"Waqar","lastName":"Hameed","id":"38193504600"},{"name":"S.

A comparison has been made between RF and FSO for usage in the cellular network whereby intercommunication link between BSC-MSC has been selected. The results clearly indicate that the FSO is superior in performance to its RF counterpart up to 5km in clear weather conditions.

These measurements allow the quality of service (QoS) provided by the network for the transmission of the applications to be assessed. However, most real-time applications generate an extensive amount of traffic data. Analysing these data in real-time is computationally intensive. Therefore, in order to reduce the amount of processed data, sampling needs to be performed. In fixed rate sampling, the sample rate is unaffected by the packet transmission rate. However, it is advantageous to adapt the sample rate in relation to packet transmission rate. In this study a novel statistical adaptive sampling method has been developed. The method adaptively adjusts the time interval between two consecutive sampled sections (called pre-and post sampling sections). This time interval is decreased when the two sections significantly differ statistically and it is increased when their net statistic is within a predefined threshold. The operation of the developed sampling method was evaluated using a simulated computer network. The results demonstrated the effectiveness of the method in various scenarios, however more work is in progress to make the method more robust.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5580380/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 July 2010","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"21-23 July 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5580380/","dateOfInsertion":"20 September 2010","publicationDate":"July 2010","accessionNumber":"11535459","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"An adaptive statistical sampling technique for computer network traffic","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An adaptive statistical sampling technique for computer network traffic","confLoc":"Newcastle Upon Tyne, UK","sourcePdf":"OTSP3.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061488S","chronDate":"21-23 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5564175","isNumber":"5580291","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5564175","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5580291","articleId":"5580380","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5580395,"authors":[{"name":"Ihsan UlHaq","affiliation":["INESC-Porto, Porto, Portugal"],"firstName":"Ihsan","lastName":"UlHaq","id":"38193507300"},{"name":"Adnan Shafiq","affiliation":["Deptt of Electrical Engineering, NWFP University of Engineering and Technology, Peshawar, Pakistan"],"firstName":"Adnan","lastName":"Shafiq","id":"38193506800"},{"name":"Khawaja M.

The algorithm helps to prevent Cell Breathing and thereby increases the Cell Capacity in terms of density of Mobile Stations (User Equipment), as the Mobile Stations at the edge of cell will not be disconnected due to Cell Breathing. One of issue with Handoff management is to ensure quality of service for wireless connections. Here by QoS we mean to reduce the probability of forced termination during handoff. Our proposed algorithm helps in successful Group handover and thus guarantees QoS by making the resources available in the target cell. Simulation study has been performed to verify the proposed algorithm.

The primary challenge in the current IEEE 802.11p draft standard is the weak performance of channel estimation (CE) in multipath environments due to insufficient pilot density. Therefore, we propose time-domain (TD) CE techniques that can effectively and accurately estimate channel tap-weighting coefficients for solving this problem. Two network traffic types are investigated in this study: periodic transmission and event transmission. In addition, the proposed TD techniques are able to perform remarkably improved CE while completely following the signaling format in the current standard, with the assistance of the symbol prefix.","publicationTitle":"2010 7th International Symposium on Communication Systems, Networks & Digital Signal Processing (CSNDSP 2010)","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 7th International Symposium on Communication Systems, Networks & Digital Signal Processing (CSNDSP 2010)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5564175/5580291/05580396.pdf","startPage":"437","endPage":"442","doi":"10.1109/CSNDSP16145.2010.5580396","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CSNDSP16145.2010.5580396","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5580291","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improved time-domain channel estimation techniques in IEEE 802.11p environments","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5580396/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 July 2010","displayDocTitle":"Improved time-domain channel estimation techniques in IEEE 802.11p environments","htmlLink":"/document/5580396/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2010","dateOfInsertion":"20 September 2010","accessionNumber":"11535475","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"21-23 July 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improved time-domain channel estimation techniques in IEEE 802.11p environments","confLoc":"Newcastle Upon Tyne, UK","sourcePdf":"Nets4Cars13.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053789S","chronDate":"21-23 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5564175","isNumber":"5580291","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5564175","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5580291","articleId":"5580396","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5580403,"authors":[{"name":"Li Chen","affiliation":["School of Electrical, Electronic and Computer Engineering, University of Newcastle, Newcastle-upon-Tyne, UK"],"firstName":"Li","lastName":"Chen","id":"37292791800"},{"name":"Rolando Carrasco","affiliation":["School of Electrical, Electronic and Computer Engineering, University of Newcastle, Newcastle-upon-Tyne, UK"],"firstName":"Rolando","lastName":"Carrasco","id":"37268994800"},{"name":"Ian Wassell","affiliation":["Digital Technology Group, Computer Laboratory, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK"],"firstName":"Ian","lastName":"Wassell","id":"37269368800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-86135-369-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8858-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5580403","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":40},"abstract":"This paper proposes a novel Distributed Amplify-and-Forward (DAF) cooperative scheme, achieving higher diversity order and yet maintaining the same transmission freedom as the conventional Amplify-and-Forward (AF) scheme. In the DAF scheme, a user's transmitted symbols are partitioned into several sequences in order to be relayed by different users. In the cooperative network, each user still uses half of their transmission time for relaying others' signals. But instead of relaying one user's entire transmitted sequence, it helps different users for the relaying. Theoretical analysis of the DAF scheme is carried out in order to justify its advantages over the existing schemes. The outage behaviour and diversity-multiplexing tradeoff (DMT) analyses of the DAF scheme are presented. Through outage behaviour analysis, it is shown the DAF scheme achieves substantial diversity gains over the AF scheme. Furthermore, the DMT analysis justifies both the scheme's achievable diversity gains and its ability to maintain the same transmission freedom as the AF scheme. The theoretical analyses are then extended to a general cooperative network consisting of N(N \u2265 2) relays, showing the diversity order can be increased with respect to the number of relays but not at the expense of each user's transmission freedom.","keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["diversity reception","multiplexing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled

the computational complexity as well as convergence time is the main task of adaptive antenna array processing. This article proposes an improved algorithm for estimating the weights of adaptive array elements based on Constant Modulus Algorithm (CMA). In this new type of algorithm, those weights that have higher effect on the radiation pattern will be estimated and antenna pattern will be adjusted by changing these weights. In this research, 3 new algorithms are proposed. By simulating these algorithms and comparing them with conventional full weight CMA, finally new algorithm that has a reduced complexity and an acceptable performance at different signal to noise ratios (SNRs) is extracted. Three cases have been simulated, pure noisy channel, channel with one interference signal and channel with two interference signals. According to the simulation results, appropriate algorithm is based on weighting the half number of array elements and updating all weights between two consecutive time to avoid error propagation.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5580408/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 July 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2010","dateOfInsertion":"20 September 2010","accessionNumber":"11535487","htmlLink":"/document/5580408/","conferenceDate":"21-23 July 2010","displayDocTitle":"CMA-based adaptive antenna array digital beamforming with reduced complexity","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"CMA-based adaptive antenna array digital beamforming with reduced complexity","confLoc":"Newcastle Upon Tyne, UK","sourcePdf":"GS2.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.103352S","chronDate":"21-23 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5564175","isNumber":"5580291","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5564175","xplore-issue":"5580291","articleId":"5580408","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5580426,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Fundamentally, its procedure can be modeled as a linear projection on one specific sensing matrix, which, in order to guarantee the information conservation, satisfies Restricted Isometry Property (RIP). Ordinarily, this matrix is constructed by the Gaussian random matrix or Bernoulli random matrix. In previous work, we have proved that the typical chaotic sequence - logistic map can be adopted to generate the sensing matrix for CS. In this paper, we show that Toeplitz-structured matrix constructed by chaotic sequence is sufficient to satisfy RIP with high probability. With the Toeplitz-structured Chaotic Sensing Matrix (TsCSM), we can easily build a filter with small number of taps. Meanwhile, we implement the TsCSM in compressive sensing of images.","doi":"10.1109/CSNDSP16145.2010.5580428","publicationTitle":"2010 7th International Symposium on Communication Systems, Networks & Digital Signal Processing (CSNDSP 2010)","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 7th International Symposium on Communication Systems, Networks & Digital Signal Processing (CSNDSP 2010)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5564175/5580291/05580428.pdf","startPage":"229","endPage":"233","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CSNDSP16145.2010.5580428","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5580291","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Toeplitz-structured Chaotic Sensing Matrix for Compressive Sensing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5580428","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 July 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5580428/","displayDocTitle":"Toeplitz-structured Chaotic Sensing Matrix for Compressive Sensing","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2010","accessionNumber":"11535507","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5580428/","conferenceDate":"21-23 July 2010","dateOfInsertion":"20 September 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Toeplitz-structured Chaotic Sensing Matrix for Compressive Sensing","confLoc":"Newcastle Upon Tyne, UK","sourcePdf":"CCS6.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.121816S","chronDate":"21-23 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5564175","isNumber":"5580291","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5564175","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5580291","articleId":"5580428","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5580430,"authors":[{"name":"N.

The stability of the LDPC decoder with higher order modulation schemes is examined on both additive-white-Gaussian-noise (AWGN) and block Rayleigh fading channels and threshold stability conditions under iterative decoding are obtained using density evolution techniques. It is shown that both on block Rayleigh fading channel when the ideal channel state information (CSI) of the fading process is known, and on AWGN channel, the stability condition of the underlying code is bounded by the Bhattacharya noise parameter. We show that the derived stability condition is both sufficient and necessary condition for iterative belief propagation decoding assuming cycle free massage passing between variable and check nodes.

To overcome this problem, a novel selected mapping (SLM) based technique named Orthogonal-SLM (OSLM) is proposed, where each candidate phase vector is perpendicular to any other vector. Moreover, the recovery of the desired phase vector is easily obtained without side information, and with the ability to reduce the computation of recovery. The performance of the proposed PAPR reduction methods was investigated for an OFDM system using 16 Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (16-QAM). Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method provides a performance improvement both in terms of complimentary cumulative distribution function (CCDF) of PAPR reduction and Bit Error Rate (BER) in the presence of a multipath fading channel.","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 7th International Symposium on Communication Systems, Networks & Digital Signal Processing (CSNDSP 2010)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5564175/5580291/05580440.pdf","startPage":"162","endPage":"166","publicationTitle":"2010 7th International Symposium on Communication Systems, Networks & Digital Signal Processing (CSNDSP 2010)","doi":"10.1109/CSNDSP16145.2010.5580440","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CSNDSP16145.2010.5580440","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5580291","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5580440","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Orthogonal-SLM technique for PAPR reduction and recovery without side information in OFDM systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Peak to average power ratio","Complexity theory","Bit error rate","Fading","Receivers","Indexes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error statistics","fading channels","interference suppression","multipath channels","OFDM modulation","quadrature amplitude modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["orthogonal SLM technique","PAPR reduction","OFDM","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","peak to average power ratio","power amplification","selected mapping","16-QAM","quadrature amplitude modulation","complimentary cumulative distribution function","bit error rate","multipath fading channel"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5580440/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 July 2010","displayDocTitle":"Orthogonal-SLM technique for PAPR reduction and recovery without side information in OFDM systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5580440/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2010","accessionNumber":"11535519","dateOfInsertion":"20 September 2010","conferenceDate":"21-23 July 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Orthogonal-SLM technique for PAPR reduction and recovery without side information in OFDM systems","confLoc":"Newcastle Upon Tyne, UK","sourcePdf":"BWN8.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060499S","chronDate":"21-23 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5564175","isNumber":"5580291","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5564175","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5580291","articleId":"5580440","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5580442,"authors":[{"name":"M.

This paper presents a proficient hardware realization of MIMO systems that is designed and implemented on a Xilinx Virtex\u2122-4 XC4VLX60 Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA) device. The MIMO encoder implementation is straight forward; however, the decoder implementation is little more complex as it requires resource utilization. The hardware, presented in this paper, utilizes the resources by adopting the technique of parallelism. A comprehensive explanation of the complete design process is provided, including a highlight on the tools used in its development. The results are obtained for 2 \u00d7 2 MIMO system for encoding and decoding at the transmitter and the receiver. The system is developed based on modular design which simplifies system design, eases hardware update and facilitates testing the various modules in an independent manner.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An efficient FPGA-based hardware implementation of MIMO wireless systems","publicationTitle":"2010 7th International Symposium on Communication Systems, Networks & Digital Signal Processing (CSNDSP 2010)","doi":"10.1109/CSNDSP16145.2010.5580442","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 7th International Symposium on Communication Systems, Networks & Digital Signal Processing (CSNDSP 2010)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5564175/5580291/05580442.pdf","startPage":"152","endPage":"156","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CSNDSP16145.2010.5580442","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5580291","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5580442","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5580442/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 July 2010","displayDocTitle":"An efficient FPGA-based hardware implementation of MIMO wireless systems","conferenceDate":"21-23 July 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5580442/","dateOfInsertion":"20 September 2010","publicationDate":"July 2010","accessionNumber":"11535521","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An efficient FPGA-based hardware implementation of MIMO wireless systems","confLoc":"Newcastle Upon Tyne, UK","sourcePdf":"BWN6.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060881S","chronDate":"21-23 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5564175","isNumber":"5580291","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5564175","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5580291","articleId":"5580442","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5580449,"authors":[{"name":"Lucy J.

The AIB consists of a sparse beamformer whose weights are updated using Steepest Descent Constant Modulus Algorithm (SD-CMA). The spatial interpolation produces grating lobes which are eliminated using a spatial masking filter. Two forms of AIB are synthesized, one uses Chebyshev spatial masking filter and the other uses Type-I spatial masking filter. Update expression for weight vector of AIB is derived. AIB achieves superior adaptability and spatial discrimination with narrow beamwidth and produces deeper nulls in the direction of interferences with fewer physical antenna elements compared to conventional SD-CMA adaptive beamformer. Simulation studies demonstrate AIB using Type-I spatial masking filter offers better nulling of interferences because of its superior tapering sidelobe characteristics compared to Chebyshev masking filter. AIB is suitable in beamforming applications where very narrow beam is required employing less number of antenna elements.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5580449/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 July 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2010","dateOfInsertion":"20 September 2010","accessionNumber":"11535528","htmlLink":"/document/5580449/","conferenceDate":"21-23 July 2010","displayDocTitle":"Synthesis of Adaptive Interpolated Beamformer","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Synthesis of Adaptive Interpolated Beamformer","confLoc":"Newcastle Upon Tyne, UK","sourcePdf":"ATST6.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050146S","chronDate":"21-23 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5564175","isNumber":"5580291","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5564175","xplore-issue":"5580291","articleId":"5580449","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5580467,"authors":[{"name":"Abdalla G.

Work in the literature has confirmed that despite the non-orthogonal structure of the sub-carriers, efficient detection of the SEFDM signal is achievable. However, loosing orthogonality brings along many design and implementation challenges. In particular, the generation of the signal requires a bank of independent modulators which becomes particularly complex with the increase in the number of carriers. In this work, we propose simple framework for the generation of the SEFDM signal based on the Inverse Discrete Fourier Transform (IDFT). The proposed designs employ similar building blocks as Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) based systems, hence, would facilitate an easy migration and/or coexistence with OFDM on the transmitter side. Furthermore, the proposed framework may facilitate the IDFT design for any Frequency Division Multiplexed (FDM) signal with arbitrary sub-carriers spacing. The equivalence of the IDFT generated signal and the modulators based signal is proved mathematically, nonetheless, numerical simulations were performed to verify that equivalence and to test for the performance of the digitally generated signal in AWGN channel. Numerical results confirmed the required spectrum compression and bite error rate (BER) performance at a much reduced complexity.","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 7th International Symposium on Communication Systems, Networks & Digital Signal Processing (CSNDSP 2010)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5564175/5580291/05580468.pdf","startPage":"20","endPage":"24","publicationTitle":"2010 7th International Symposium on Communication Systems, Networks & Digital Signal Processing (CSNDSP 2010)","doi":"10.1109/CSNDSP16145.2010.5580468","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CSNDSP16145.2010.5580468","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5580291","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5580468","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Simple DSP-IDFT techniques for generating spectrally efficient FDM signals","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Transmitters","Complexity theory","Frequency division multiplexing","Bit error rate","Bandwidth","Modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["AWGN channels","discrete Fourier transforms","error statistics","inverse problems","OFDM modulation","signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DSP-IDFT techniques","FDM signals","spectrally efficient frequency division multiplexing system","multiplexing overlapped nonorthogonal subcarriers","inverse discrete Fourier transform","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing based systems","AWGN channel","bite error rate","spectrum compression"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5580468/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 July 2010","displayDocTitle":"Simple DSP-IDFT techniques for generating spectrally efficient FDM signals","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5580468/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2010","accessionNumber":"11535547","dateOfInsertion":"20 September 2010","conferenceDate":"21-23 July 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Simple DSP-IDFT techniques for generating spectrally efficient FDM signals","confLoc":"Newcastle Upon Tyne, UK","sourcePdf":"ACSP5.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077227S","chronDate":"21-23 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5564175","isNumber":"5580291","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5564175","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"5580291","articleId":"5580468","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5580488,"authors":[{"name":"P.

However, the people holding the RFID card passing through the access control may not be the authorized one. Therefore, an access control system combining RFID technology and face recognition based on neural network is presented in this work. The system recognizes the face of the person holding the RFID card and denies access if they do not match. We adopt a Radial Basis Function Neural Network (RBFNN) to learn the face of authorized card holders and save the parameters of RBFNN only. This could reduce storage when the number of card holders getting large. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) features are extracted to reduce the dimensions of face image data. The Localized Generalization Error Model (L-GEM) is adopted to train a RBFNN for better generalization capability. The face recognition system is first evaluated by benchmarking ORL face image database. The whole access control system is then tested in a real environment. Experimental results show that the proposed method has a good performance and could improve the security of RFID access control.","doi":"10.1109/ICMLC.2010.5580558","startPage":"675","endPage":"680","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMLC.2010.5580558","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5580476","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/5570011/5580476/05580558.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Access control by RFID and face recognition based on neural network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5580558/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Access control by RFID and face recognition based on neural network","isConference":true,"volume":"2","htmlLink":"/document/5580558/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11535684","publicationDate":"July 2010","dateOfInsertion":"20 September 2010","conferenceDate":"11-14 July 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 July 2010","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Access control by RFID and face recognition based on neural network","confLoc":"Qingdao, China","sourcePdf":"06754238.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.115531S","chronDate":"11-14 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5570011","isNumber":"5580476","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5570011","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"5580476","articleId":"5580558","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5580571,"authors":[{"name":"Yi Hong","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of California, Los Angeles, USA"],"firstName":"Yi","lastName":"Hong","id":"37535381300"},{"name":"Hanli Wang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Tongji University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Hanli","lastName":"Wang","id":"37292564900"},{"name":"Sam Kwong","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Sam","lastName":"Kwong","id":"37266290800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6527-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6526-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6525-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2160-133X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2160-1348"}],"articleNumber":"5580571","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":170},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5580571","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Artificial neural networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image sampling","image segmentation","random processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["random spatial sampling","majority voting","Otsu image thresholding algorithm","consensus binary image","binary subimages"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Image thresholding","random spatial sampling","majority voting"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents a novel image thresholding algorithm, namely Random spatial sampling and Majority voting based Image Thresholding (RMIT) algorithm. The proposed image thresholding algorithm RMIT firstly obtains a population of thresholded sub-images by using random spatial sampling and the well-known Otsu's image thresholding algorithm, then aggregates all obtained binary sub-images into a consensus binary image via majority voting. Since the sub-images are randomly selected with different sizes ranging from one pixel to the entire image, RMIT can make use of both global and local information for thresholding an image without any prior knowledge about the image. The effectiveness of RMIT is confirmed by experimental results on benchmark real images.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5580476","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMLC.2010.5580571","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/5570011/5580476/05580571.pdf","startPage":"746","endPage":"751","doi":"10.1109/ICMLC.2010.5580571","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Image thresholding based on Random spatial sampling and Majority voting","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 July 2010","displayDocTitle":"Image thresholding based on Random spatial sampling and Majority voting","isConference":true,"volume":"2","conferenceDate":"11-14 July 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5580571/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2010","accessionNumber":"11535697","dateOfInsertion":"20 September 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5580571/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Image thresholding based on Random spatial sampling and Majority voting","confLoc":"Qingdao, China","sourcePdf":"07463535.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.149838S","chronDate":"11-14 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5570011","isNumber":"5580476","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5570011","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5580476","articleId":"5580571","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":5580586,"authors":[{"name":"Yan Zhou","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Technology, Foshan University, Foshan, China"],"firstName":"Yan","lastName":"Zhou","id":"38194386800"},{"name":"Yong Zhong","affiliation":["Information and Education Technology Center, Foshan University, Foshan, China"],"firstName":"Yong","lastName":"Zhong","id":"38194603000"},{"name":"Dong Wang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Technology, Foshan University, Foshan, China"],"firstName":"Dong","lastName":"Wang","id":"37655887900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6527-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6526-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6525-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2160-133X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2160-1348"}],"articleNumber":"5580586","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":575},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image reconstruction","Sparse matrices","Image resolution","Signal resolution","Machine learning algorithms","Matching pursuit algorithms","Compressed sensing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image reconstruction","image resolution","sparse matrices"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image reconstruction","high resolution image","compressed sensing","signal acquisition system","Nyquist sampling theory","image processing field","Gaussian measurement matrix"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["High resolution image","Compressed sensing","Restricted isometric property","Sparse projection matrix","OMP algorithm"]}],"abstract":"Constrained by traditional sampling theory, it is difficult to obtain high resolution image directly by signal acquisition system. The method that uses compressed sensing technology to measure the high resolution image and reconstruct with measurements breaks the bottleneck of Nyquist sampling theory, which is a new application for compressed sensing in image processing field. In CS, the reconstruction of super resolution image can be converted to how to construct measurement matrix and design reconstruction algorithm. For the reason that Gaussian measurement matrix requires a great number of high dimensional projection computations, we introduce sparse random projection into compressed sensing, proposing a measurement matrix which obeys sparse random projection distribution: sparse projection matrix. For the reason that the existing OMP algorithms require a lot of linear measurements to ensure accurate reconstruction, we propose an improved OMP algorithm. Experimental results show that, with sparse projection matrix and the improved OMP algorithm, high resolution image can be reconstructed accurately with little number of measurements.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The reconstruction of high resolution image based on compressed sensing","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics","doi":"10.1109/ICMLC.2010.5580586","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/5570011/5580476/05580586.pdf","startPage":"828","endPage":"832","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMLC.2010.5580586","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5580476","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5580586","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5580586/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 July 2010","displayDocTitle":"The reconstruction of high resolution image based on compressed sensing","conferenceDate":"11-14 July 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"2","htmlLink":"/document/5580586/","dateOfInsertion":"20 September 2010","publicationDate":"July 2010","accessionNumber":"11535712","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The reconstruction of high resolution image based on compressed sensing","confLoc":"Qingdao, China","sourcePdf":"08283584.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038518S","chronDate":"11-14 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5570011","isNumber":"5580476","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5570011","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5580476","articleId":"5580586","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5580590,"authors":[{"name":"You Gao","affiliation":["College of Sciences, Civil Aviation University of China, Tianjin, China"],"firstName":"You","lastName":"Gao","id":"37695115200"},{"name":"Yu-Ting Xiao","affiliation":["College of Sciences, Civil Aviation University of China, Tianjin, China"],"firstName":"Yu-Ting","lastName":"Xiao","id":"38194976900"},{"name":"Ya-Yuan Tao","affiliation":["College of Sciences, Civil Aviation University of China, Tianjin, China"],"firstName":"Ya-Yuan","lastName":"Tao","id":"38194819000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6527-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6526-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6525-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2160-133X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2160-1348"}],"articleNumber":"5580590","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":82},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5580590","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Artificial neural networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["BCH codes","quantum computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["quantum BCH code construction","odd characteristic finite fields","classical q-ary nonprimitive BCH codes","Bose-Chaudhuri-Hocquenghem codes"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["non-binary quantum codes","non-primitive BCH codes","self-orthogonal codes"]}],"abstract":"Let F\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">q</sub>\n be finite field with q elements, where q is a power of an odd prime p.

Compared with normal inverted pendulum system, the angle bracket inverted pendulum has an inertia weight that caused by gravity downward along the ramp. The character of this system increases the difficulty of balancing the pole. In this paper, adaptive dynamic programming method is used for the system control. Two neural networks are designed separately to achieve the estimation of cost-to-go function and the output of control action through continuously learning. In the utility function design, the consideration of inertia influence is included which makes the estimation of system cost more exactly. In the output layer of the action network we use the S function as the transfer function that makes the outputs of control action be continuous variables. Furthermore, we increase a compensation part to decrease the influence caused by inertia factor. Simulation results show that the method has good results, also prove that it is feasible for the adaptive dynamic programming method to solve inertia problem.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Mathematical model","Equations","Artificial neural networks","Dynamic programming","Gravity","Adaptive systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive control","control system synthesis","dynamic programming","learning systems","neural nets","nonlinear control systems","pendulums"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive critic design","angle bracket inverted pendulum control","complex nonlinear system","inertia weight","adaptive dynamic programming method","neural networks","cost-to-go function","inertia influence","S function","inertia factor"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Adaptive dynamic critic designs","Angle bracket inverted pendulum","Neural network","Action-dependent adaptive dynamic programming"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5580633","doi":"10.1109/ICMLC.2010.5580633","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/5570011/5580473/05580633.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMLC.2010.5580633","startPage":"2198","endPage":"2203","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5580473","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Application of adaptive critic design on angle bracket inverted pendulum control","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Application of adaptive critic design on angle bracket inverted pendulum control","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5580633/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 July 2010","conferenceDate":"11-14 July 2010","isConference":true,"volume":"5","htmlLink":"/document/5580633/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"20 September 2010","publicationDate":"July 2010","accessionNumber":"11535768","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Application of adaptive critic design on angle bracket inverted pendulum control","confLoc":"Qingdao, China","sourcePdf":"21984143.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05934S","chronDate":"11-14 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5570011","isNumber":"5580473","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5570011","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5580473","articleId":"5580633","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":5580651,"authors":[{"name":"Yun Du","affiliation":["Hebei University of Science and Technology, Shijiazhuang, China"],"firstName":"Yun","lastName":"Du","id":"37066115500"},{"name":"Hui-Qin Sun","affiliation":["Hebei University of Science and Technology, Shijiazhuang, China"],"firstName":"Hui-Qin","lastName":"Sun","id":"37557062100"},{"name":"Fan-Hua Meng","affiliation":["Hebei University of Science and Technology, Shijiazhuang, China"],"firstName":"Fan-Hua","lastName":"Meng","id":"37684305600"},{"name":"Su-Ying Zhang","affiliation":["Hebei University of Science and Technology, Shijiazhuang, China"],"firstName":"Su-Ying","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37535977400"},{"name":"Qiang Tian","affiliation":["Shijiazhuang Realty Administerial, Shijiazhuang, China"],"firstName":"Qiang","lastName":"Tian","id":"37893181800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6527-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6526-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6525-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2160-133X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2160-1348"}],"articleNumber":"5580651","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":113},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Artificial neural networks","Nonlinear dynamical systems","Neurons","Mathematical model","Training","Equations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["identification","linear systems","MIMO systems","nonlinear systems","recurrent neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nonlinear system identification","input linearization dynamic recurrent neural network","time-lag SISO dynamic system","online identification","SISO nonlinear dynamic system identification"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Neural network","Input linearization","Dynamic recurrent","On-line identification"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5580651","abstract":"In this paper, it studies the problems of the on-line identification on the nonlinear and time-lag SISO dynamic system.

This paper proposed an algorithm to determine the appropriate number of clusters and produced an associated set of cluster centers automatically. The proposed algorithm was compared with stand-alone PSO clustering and fuzzy c-means on three data sets. The results of the experiment showed that the proposed method was able to determine the number of clusters accurately, and to deliver favorable performance in the clustering of data.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 July 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5580690/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11535886","isConference":true,"volume":"6","htmlLink":"/document/5580690/","publicationDate":"July 2010","dateOfInsertion":"20 September 2010","conferenceDate":"11-14 July 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Evolutionary dynamic particle swarm optimization for data clustering","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Evolutionary dynamic particle swarm optimization for data clustering","confLoc":"Qingdao, China","sourcePdf":"32404256.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042415S","chronDate":"11-14 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5570011","isNumber":"5580670","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5570011","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5580670","articleId":"5580690","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5580691,"authors":[{"name":"Yong-Yi Fanjiang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, Fu Jen Catholic University, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yong-Yi","lastName":"Fanjiang","id":"37329512600"},{"name":"Yang Syu","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, Fu Jen Catholic University, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yang","lastName":"Syu","id":"37889765200"},{"name":"Chun-Hung Wu","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, Fu Jen Catholic University, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chun-Hung","lastName":"Wu","id":"37982912800"},{"name":"Jong-Yih Kuo","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, National Taipei University of Technology, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Jong-Yih","lastName":"Kuo","id":"37275496500"},{"name":"Shang-Pin Ma","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, National Taiwan Ocean University, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Shang-Pin","lastName":"Ma","id":"37406093500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6527-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6526-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6525-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2160-133X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2160-1348"}],"articleNumber":"5580691","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":327},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5580691","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Genetics","Quality of service","Noise measurement","Availability","Service oriented architecture","Concrete"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["case-based reasoning","genetic algorithms","quality of service","software architecture","Web services"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithm","QoS aware dynamic Web service","service oriented architecture","SOA","software development","dynamic service composition","user requirement","case-based reasoning","flexible service workflow"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Genetic algorithm","QoS","service composition"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICMLC.2010.5580691","pdfPath":"/iel5/5570011/5580670/05580691.pdf","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics","startPage":"3246","endPage":"3251","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5580670","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMLC.2010.5580691","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Genetic algorithm for QoS-aware dynamic web services composition","abstract":"Nowadays, the Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) as well as orchestration technology becomes trend of software development. The benefit of SOA is that we will save cost and time extremely due to the services utilized are already exist and reuse those services as well as integrate them. Currently, the main issues of SOA are how to define workflow as well as how to select the suitable services to perform this workflow with QoS. Many approaches separate workflow defined and services with QoS selected, therefore, will sacrifice the user's feasibility.

This paper intends to illustrate the representation of the ANN applied in load forecast based on practical situation in Ontario Province, Canada.","doi":"10.1109/ICMLC.2010.5580713","startPage":"3200","endPage":"3205","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/5570011/5580670/05580713.pdf","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMLC.2010.5580713","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5580670","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Artificial neural network for load forecasting in smart grid","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neurons","Training","Artificial neural networks","Load forecasting","Load modeling","Meteorology","Simulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["artificial intelligence","load forecasting","neural nets","power engineering computing","power system planning","smart power grids"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["artificial neural network","load forecasting","smart grid","planning","power system","ANN","Canada"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Load forecast","Artificial Neuron Network","back propagation training","Matlab"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5580713/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 July 2010","displayDocTitle":"Artificial neural network for load forecasting in smart grid","isConference":true,"volume":"6","htmlLink":"/document/5580713/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2010","dateOfInsertion":"20 September 2010","conferenceDate":"11-14 July 2010","accessionNumber":"11535907","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Artificial neural network for load forecasting in smart grid","confLoc":"Qingdao, China","sourcePdf":"32004232.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.084209S","chronDate":"11-14 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5570011","isNumber":"5580670","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5570011","citationCount":"43","xplore-issue":"5580670","articleId":"5580713","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5580725,"authors":[{"name":"Wei-Hua Wang","affiliation":["College of Information Engineering, Shanghai Maritime University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Wei-Hua","lastName":"Wang","id":"37538929100"},{"name":"Guang-Zhong Liu","affiliation":["College of Information Engineering, Shanghai Maritime University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Guang-Zhong","lastName":"Liu","id":"38195806400"},{"name":"Wei-Wei Yu","affiliation":["College of Information Engineering, Shanghai Maritime University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Wei-Wei","lastName":"Yu","id":"38195420500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6527-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6526-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6525-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2160-133X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2160-1348"}],"articleNumber":"5580725","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":242},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Matching pursuit algorithms","Signal processing algorithms","Blind source separation","Algorithm design and analysis","Clustering algorithms","Sensors","Equations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["blind source separation","iterative methods","matrix algebra"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["blind source separation","matching pursuit","BSS","mixing matrix","sparsity condition","signal sparse representation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Underdetermined blind source separation","Sparse component analysis","Clustering","Matching pursuit"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, the blind source separation problem in underdetermined case is researched. The separation of underdetermined BSS usually can be solved by a two-stage method: estimating mixing matrix and reconstructing source signals. The mixing matrix can be estimated if the sources satisfy the sparsity conditions. An algorithm of sparse sources recovery based on matching pursuit (MP) is proposed. MP is an algorithm which can deduce a sparse representation of a signal. Considering its utilization in sparse sources recovery of blind source separation, this paper improves classical MP algorithm and has obtained a better performance. Proposed method works well even the mixing matrix is ill-conditioned by reduce the error when match failed.","doi":"10.1109/ICMLC.2010.5580725","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/5570011/5580670/05580725.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMLC.2010.5580725","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5580670","startPage":"3107","endPage":"3110","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Novel algorithm for underdetermined blind source separation based on matching pursuit","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5580725","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Novel algorithm for underdetermined blind source separation based on matching pursuit","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 July 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5580725/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"11-14 July 2010","isConference":true,"volume":"6","publicationDate":"July 2010","accessionNumber":"11535917","dateOfInsertion":"20 September 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5580725/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Novel algorithm for underdetermined blind source separation based on matching pursuit","confLoc":"Qingdao, China","sourcePdf":"31074224.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.080375S","chronDate":"11-14 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5570011","isNumber":"5580670","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5570011","xplore-issue":"5580670","articleId":"5580725","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":5580730,"authors":[{"name":"Chunmei Ding","affiliation":["Institute of Metrology and Computational Science, China Jiliang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China"],"firstName":"Chunmei","lastName":"Ding","id":"38196704100"},{"name":"Yubo Yuan","affiliation":["Institute of Metrology and Computational Science, China Jiliang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China"],"firstName":"Yubo","lastName":"Yuan","id":"37895276700"},{"name":"Feilong Cao","affiliation":["Institute of Metrology and Computational Science, China Jiliang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China"],"firstName":"Feilong","lastName":"Cao","id":"37531768200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6527-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6526-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6525-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2160-133X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2160-1348"}],"articleNumber":"5580730","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":56},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Artificial neural networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["approximation theory","interpolation","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["approximate interpolation","neural networks","Lebesgue metrix","p-th Lebesgue integrable function approximation","Steklov mean function"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Neural networks","Interpolation","Approximation","Estimate of error","Lebesgue metric"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5580730","abstract":"In this paper, a class of approximate interpolation neural networks is constructed to approximate Lebesgue integrable functions.

With the development of society, energy saving and environmental protection have become a topical issue. The sun energy using is in the rapid development and application; however, the amount of power produced by a sun tracker depends upon the amount of sun light. This paper proposes a fuzzy sliding-mode controller (FSMC) with a time-varying sliding surface to control a light tacking system via the sliding-mode control approach. The proposed FSMC system is composed of a fuzzy controller and a slope regulator. The fuzzy controller infers the control action to control the system states to reach the sliding surface without large overshoot, and the slope regulator tunes the slope of the sliding surface to govern small convergence time of the system trajectories. Thus, the proposed FSMC system can achieve satisfactory tracking performance with fast transient response and good robustness. Finally, the proposed FSMC system is implemented based on a field programmable gate array chip for low-cost and high-performance industrial applications. The experimental results show the proposed FSMC can achieve favorable tracking performance for the light tracking system even under a payload onto the platform of the light tracking system.","doi":"10.1109/ICMLC.2010.5580788","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/5570011/5580670/05580788.pdf","startPage":"2782","endPage":"2787","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMLC.2010.5580788","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5580670","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5580788","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of an FPGA-based fuzzy sliding-mode controller for light tracking systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 July 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5580788/","displayDocTitle":"Design of an FPGA-based fuzzy sliding-mode controller for light tracking systems","isConference":true,"volume":"6","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5580788/","publicationDate":"July 2010","dateOfInsertion":"20 September 2010","conferenceDate":"11-14 July 2010","accessionNumber":"11535972","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of an FPGA-based fuzzy sliding-mode controller for light tracking systems","confLoc":"Qingdao, China","sourcePdf":"27824109.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061327S","chronDate":"11-14 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5570011","isNumber":"5580670","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5570011","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5580670","articleId":"5580788","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":5580797,"authors":[{"name":"Hsi-Lin Chen","affiliation":["Graduate Institute of Automation and Control, National Taiwan University of Science and Technology, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Hsi-Lin","lastName":"Chen","id":"38195795600"},{"name":"M.

In this study, a swimmer's behavior is composed of a series of the static image-frames. For each frame, a Convexity-Structure is used to enclose the swimmer's shape after segmenting the swimmer-blob. A codebook is created for mapping a swimmer-blob into one of 6 feature blob-types during training and recognition stage. Consequently, the time-sequential blobs are converted to a feature-vector sequence and transformed into a symbolic-sequence by the existed codebook. Thus a learned HMM can be obtained by this symbolic-sequence from a given specific-behavior and used to recognize a swimmer's behavior which is normal or abnormal. Four different swimming styles (Backstroke, Breaststroke, Freestyle, and Butterfly) are examined. An average recognition rate of 90% is obtained.","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/5570011/5580473/05580797.pdf","startPage":"2459","endPage":"2465","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics","doi":"10.1109/ICMLC.2010.5580797","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMLC.2010.5580797","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5580473","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5580797","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Hidden Markov Model-based approach for recognizing swimmer's behaviors in swimming pool","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hidden Markov models","Feature extraction","Markov processes","Shape","Machine learning","Cybernetics","Probability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["behavioural sciences computing","hidden Markov models","image recognition","image segmentation","learning (artificial intelligence)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["swimmer behavior recognition","static image-frames","convexity structure","swimmer-blob segmentation","codebook","swimmer-blob mapping","feature-vector sequence","symbolic sequence","video surveillance","hidden Markov model","time-sequential blobs"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Hidden Markov model (HMM)","Video surveillance","Swimming style","Abnormal behavior detection"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5580797/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 July 2010","displayDocTitle":"A Hidden Markov Model-based approach for recognizing swimmer's behaviors in swimming pool","isConference":true,"volume":"5","htmlLink":"/document/5580797/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2010","accessionNumber":"11535819","dateOfInsertion":"20 September 2010","conferenceDate":"11-14 July 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Hidden Markov Model-based approach for recognizing swimmer's behaviors in swimming pool","confLoc":"Qingdao, China","sourcePdf":"24594064.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056598S","chronDate":"11-14 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5570011","isNumber":"5580473","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5570011","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5580473","articleId":"5580797","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5580809,"authors":[{"name":"Shyi-Ming Chen","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, National Taiwan University of Science and Technology, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Shyi-Ming","lastName":"Chen","id":"37277603600"},{"name":"Chih-Yao Chien","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, National Taiwan University of Science and Technology, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chih-Yao","lastName":"Chien","id":"37895343000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6527-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6526-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6525-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2160-133X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2160-1348"}],"articleNumber":"5580809","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":408},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cities and towns","Biological cells","Simulated annealing","Traveling salesman problems","Particle swarm optimization","Genetics","Machine learning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","particle swarm optimisation","simulated annealing","travelling salesman problems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["traveling salesman problem","genetic simulated annealing","ant colony system","particle swarm optimization"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Traveling salesman problem","Genetic algorithms","Ant colony system","Simulated annealing","Particle swarm optimization","Genetic simulated annealing ant colony system with particle swarm optimization techniques"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5580809","abstract":"In this paper, we present a new method for solving the traveling salesman problem based on the genetic simulated annealing ant colony system with particle swarm optimization techniques.

A simulation study shows that it has strong robustness and adaptive abilities and higher control accuracy.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 July 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5580842/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11536013","isConference":true,"volume":"3","htmlLink":"/document/5580842/","publicationDate":"July 2010","dateOfInsertion":"20 September 2010","conferenceDate":"11-14 July 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Research on pressurizer water level control of nuclear reactor based on RBF neural network and PID controller","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Research on pressurizer water level control of nuclear reactor based on RBF neural network and PID controller","confLoc":"Qingdao, China","sourcePdf":"14863807.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056639S","chronDate":"11-14 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5570011","isNumber":"5580799","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5570011","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5580799","articleId":"5580842","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5580844,"authors":[{"name":"Hui-Feng Shi","affiliation":["School of Mathematics and Physics, North China Electric Power University, Baoding, China"],"firstName":"Hui-Feng","lastName":"Shi","id":"37695470300"},{"name":"Yanxia Lu","affiliation":["School of Mathematics and Physics, North China Electric Power University, Baoding, China"],"firstName":"Yanxia","lastName":"Lu","id":"37088646557"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6527-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6526-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6525-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2160-133X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2160-1348"}],"articleNumber":"5580844","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":196},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5580844","abstract":"This paper reports on Bayesian technique to design an optimal neural networks based model for short term load forecasting.

In Hybrid Monte Carlo algorithm, the Hamilton function is the regularized error function, and the position variables is weights. In simulation experiments, two types Bayesian neural networks with Normal weight and Cauchy weight are used to hour load forecasting.

The demand for monitoring quality is not only to capture the object image, but also to present sharp and recognizable image. Thus, PTZ camera, which has pan and zoom functions, has become the best equipment. How to zoom in object and move camera lens so that the object is placed at the center of image becomes the major issue. This paper proposes the method of using the widest camera viewing angle as the moving range, and employing the spatial adjustment method of camera to establish the relative position of the camera and space. However, once the targeted object is unclear, the zoom in function of the PTZ camera is used; if the targeted object is not within the center of the image, the targeted object will move out of the image frame during the zoom-in process. Hence, by using the fuzzy nerves to simulate nonlinear horizontal movement and vertical rotation of PTZ camera, the image can be moved to the center of the image. In this paper, PTZ camera can zoom in image of the targeted object and move camera lens so that the object is at the frame center. Without additional adjustment, the camera lens can be moved exactly to the target position.","doi":"10.1109/ICMLC.2010.5580868","startPage":"2577","endPage":"2582","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/5570011/5580473/05580868.pdf","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMLC.2010.5580868","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5580473","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Application of using fuzzy-neural network on PTZ camera","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cameras","Equations","Mathematical model","Copper","Calibration","Training","Artificial neural networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["calibration","cameras","fuzzy neural nets","image motion analysis","photographic lenses","surveillance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fuzzy neural network","PTZ camera","surveillance system","quality monitoring","image recognition","spatial adjustment method","zoom-in process","image frame","nonlinear horizontal movement","camera lens"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Fuzzy neural network","Ellipse detection"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5580868/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 July 2010","displayDocTitle":"Application of using fuzzy-neural network on PTZ camera","isConference":true,"volume":"5","htmlLink":"/document/5580868/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2010","dateOfInsertion":"20 September 2010","conferenceDate":"11-14 July 2010","accessionNumber":"11535840","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Application of using fuzzy-neural network on PTZ camera","confLoc":"Qingdao, China","sourcePdf":"25774042.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060226S","chronDate":"11-14 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5570011","isNumber":"5580473","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5570011","xplore-issue":"5580473","articleId":"5580868","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5580871,"authors":[{"name":"Lin-Yu Tseng","affiliation":["National Chung Hsing University, Taichung, TW"],"firstName":"Lin-Yu","lastName":"Tseng","id":"37410521500"},{"name":"Li-Chin Huang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, National Chung Hsing University, Taichung, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Li-Chin","lastName":"Huang","id":"37676615800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6527-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6526-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6525-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2160-133X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2160-1348"}],"articleNumber":"5580871","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":232},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5580871","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Lungs","Pixel","Computed tomography","Cancer","Image segmentation","Diseases","Shape"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cancer","computerised tomography","diagnostic radiography","genetic algorithms","lung"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automatic fissure detection method","genetic algorithm","lung cancer","computer-aided diagnosis","CT image interpretations","scanner technology","medical imaging data","CAD systems","chest CT images","oblique fissures"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Computed tomography","Computer-aided diagnosis","Lung fissure","Genetic algorithm"]}],"abstract":"Lung cancer is one of the most frequently occurring cancer and has a very low five-year survival rate. Computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) helps reducing the burden of radiologists and improving the accuracy of abnormality detection during CT image interpretations. Owing to rapid development of the scanner technology, the volume of medical imaging data is becoming huger and huger. Automated segmentations of the target organ region are always required by the CAD systems. Although the analysis of lung fissures provides important information for treatment, it is still a challenge to extract fissures automatically based on the CT values because the appearance of lung fissures is very fuzzy and indefinite. Since the oblique fissures can be visualized more easily among other fissures on the chest CT images, they are used to check the exact localization of the lesions. In this paper, we propose a fully automatic fissure detection method based on the genetic algorithm to identify the oblique fissures. The accurate rates of identifying the oblique fissures in the right lung and the left lung are 97% and 86%, respectively when the method was tested on 87 slices.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5580473","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMLC.2010.5580871","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/5570011/5580473/05580871.pdf","startPage":"2583","endPage":"2588","doi":"10.1109/ICMLC.2010.5580871","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Automatic fissure detection in CT images based on the genetic algorithm","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 July 2010","displayDocTitle":"Automatic fissure detection in CT images based on the genetic algorithm","isConference":true,"volume":"5","conferenceDate":"11-14 July 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5580871/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2010","accessionNumber":"11535841","dateOfInsertion":"20 September 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5580871/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automatic fissure detection in CT images based on the genetic algorithm","confLoc":"Qingdao, China","sourcePdf":"25834050.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053271S","chronDate":"11-14 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5570011","isNumber":"5580473","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5570011","xplore-issue":"5580473","articleId":"5580871","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5580940,"authors":[{"name":"Jian-Min Chen","affiliation":["College of Computer Science, Beijing University of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jian-Min","lastName":"Chen","id":"38195655700"},{"name":"Yu-Meng Feng","affiliation":["College of Computer Science, Beijing University of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yu-Meng","lastName":"Feng","id":"37086774571"},{"name":"Yin-Ming Mei","affiliation":["Kingsoft Corporation Limited, China"],"firstName":"Yin-Ming","lastName":"Mei","id":"38194409600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6527-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6526-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6525-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2160-133X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2160-1348"}],"articleNumber":"5580940","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":86},"abstract":"With the rapid development of Internet application, malware detection becomes more and more important and tremendous.

Consequently, we decided to utilize ensemble theory which aims at replacing a complex object by effectively combining simpler analogical elements. In this paper, we build a neural network ensemble of multiple independent neural network controllers with an output fusion method based on k-nearest-neighbor (KNN)-like algorithm. implementing neural network ensemble on control problems, we successfully simulated the control output actuated by certain input signals. Comparison of this method with a traditional single neural network controller shows that the neural network controller ensemble does have a better performance on system converging speed and disturbance resistance.","doi":"10.1109/ICMLC.2010.5581036","pdfPath":"/iel5/5570011/5581001/05581036.pdf","startPage":"357","endPage":"362","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMLC.2010.5581036","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5581001","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel approach on control simulation using neural network ensemble","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5581036/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 July 2010","displayDocTitle":"A novel approach on control simulation using neural network ensemble","isConference":true,"volume":"1","dateOfInsertion":"20 September 2010","accessionNumber":"11536286","publicationDate":"July 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5581036/","conferenceDate":"11-14 July 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel approach on control simulation using neural network ensemble","confLoc":"Qingdao, China","sourcePdf":"03574250.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.103267S","chronDate":"11-14 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5570011","isNumber":"5581001","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5570011","xplore-issue":"5581001","articleId":"5581036","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5581104,"authors":[{"name":"Kostas Peppas","affiliation":["Laboratory of Wireless Communications, Institute of Informatics and Telecommunications, Patriarhou Grigoriou and Neapoleos, National Center for Scientific Research Demokritos, Athens, Greece"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/9739/6065679/5581104/5581104-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Kostas P.

In this paper, we first present a survey of the most recent methods that achieve interoperability between 3G and WLAN systems. Motivated by the above presented methods, we propose a mechanism that achieves interoperability between an HSDPA cellular system and a WLAN radio access network. The mechanism is based on the definition and calculation of a cost function which uses suitable metrics to trigger interoperability. The performance of the interoperability mechanism is evaluated by means of system level simulations, assuming that both HSDPA and WLAN are enhanced with MIMO space-time coded techniques. Extensive simulations have shown that the incorporation of MIMO schemes greatly affects the inter-system handovers while significant performance enhancements can be achieved at the system level.","doi":"10.1109/SURV.2011.082010.00087","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials","pdfPath":"/iel5/9739/6065679/05581104.pdf","startPage":"708","endPage":"720","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SURV.2011.082010.00087","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6065679","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Impact of MIMO Techniques on the Interoperability between UMTS-HSDPA and WLAN Wireless Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5581104","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 September 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Fourth Quarter  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5581104/","displayDocTitle":"Impact of MIMO Techniques on the Interoperability between UMTS-HSDPA and WLAN Wireless Systems","volume":"13","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Fourth Quarter 2011","accessionNumber":"12359781","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5581104/","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Impact of MIMO Techniques on the Interoperability between UMTS-HSDPA and WLAN Wireless Systems","sourcePdf":"11skiannis.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.084977S","chronDate":"Fourth Quarter  2011","xplore-pub-id":"9739","isNumber":"6065679","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9739","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6065679","articleId":"5581104","onlineDate":"20 September 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5581105,"authors":[{"name":"Thomas Watteyne","affiliation":["Berkeley Sensor & Actuator Center, University of California, Berkeley, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/9739/6065679/5581105/5581105-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Thomas Watteyne is a postdoctoral researcher at the Berkeley Sensor & Actuator Center, University of California in Berkeley, working with Prof. Kristofer S.J.

An optimized choice of such routing path is known to significantly increase the performance of said networks. This holds particularly true for wireless sensor networks (WSNs) consisting of a large amount of miniaturized battery-powered wireless networked sensors required to operate for years with no human intervention. There has hence been a growing interest on understanding and optimizing WSN routing and networking protocols in recent years, where the limited and constrained resources have driven research towards primarily reducing energy consumption, memory requirements and complexity of routing functionalities. To this end, early flooding-based and hierarchical protocols have migrated within the past decade to geographic and self-organizing coordinate-based routing solutions. The former have been brought to standardization through the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) Mobile Ad-hoc Networks (MANET) working group; the latter are currently finding their way into standardization through the IETF Routing Over Low power and Lossy networks (ROLL) working group. This article thus surveys this paradigm shift for routing in WSNs and, unlike previous milestone surveys, follows a rather chronological organization within the given protocol taxonomy. For each protocol family, we provide a didactic presentation of the basic concept, a discussion on the enhancements and variants on that concept, and a detailed description of the latest state-of-the-art protocols of that family. We believe that this organization sheds some light on the design choices of emerging IETF ROLL protocols and also provides design parameters of interest to the WSN engineer, essentially enabling the design and implementation of more reliable and efficient WSN solutions.","doi":"10.1109/SURV.2011.082710.00092","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials","pdfPath":"/iel5/9739/6065679/05581105.pdf","startPage":"688","endPage":"707","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SURV.2011.082710.00092","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6065679","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"From MANET To IETF ROLL Standardization: A Paradigm Shift in WSN Routing Protocols","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5581105/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 September 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Fourth Quarter  2011","displayDocTitle":"From MANET To IETF ROLL Standardization: A Paradigm Shift in WSN Routing Protocols","volume":"13","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Fourth Quarter 2011","accessionNumber":"12359782","htmlLink":"/document/5581105/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"From MANET To IETF ROLL Standardization: A Paradigm Shift in WSN Routing Protocols","sourcePdf":"10watteyne.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.163917S","chronDate":"Fourth Quarter  2011","xplore-pub-id":"9739","isNumber":"6065679","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9739","citationCount":"105","xplore-issue":"6065679","articleId":"5581105","onlineDate":"20 September 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5581106,"authors":[{"name":"Stenio Fernandes","affiliation":["School of Information Technology and Engineering (SITE), University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/9739/6151681/5581106/5581106-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Stenio Fernandes became a member of IEEE in 1997.

We describe the design rationale for selected architectures, with an in-depth analysis of their main goals, assumptions, and requirements. We also provide directions for further work in this field by highlighting the mandatory requirements and the features of future architectures. We then present a new architecture called Context-Aware Mobility Management System (CAMMS). CAMMS is a new cross-layer, context-aware and interactive approach to seamless handover of users and services.

Although many localization algorithms have been proposed for terrestrial sensor networks in recent years, it is not feasible to directly use these algorithms in UWSNs since UWSNs lack a fast and reliable communication channel. Further, due to their slow convergence speeds and high communication overhead, distributed localization algorithms designed for small-scale UWSNs are not practical for large-scale underwater sensor systems. To achieve accurate and energy efficient node localization in large-scale UWSNs, an asymmetrical round trip based localization (ARTL) algorithm is proposed in this paper. This algorithm has low computational complexity and excellent scalability. Without time synchronization, this algorithm can achieve highly accurate ranging in large-scale UWSNs. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our design in terms of both localization accuracy and energy consumption.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2010.090210.100146","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5626930","startPage":"3532","endPage":"3542","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/5626930/05581198.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2010.090210.100146","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Asymmetrical Round Trip Based Synchronization-Free Localization in Large-Scale Underwater Sensor Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Distance measurement","Synchronization","Base stations","Wireless sensor networks","Energy consumption","Accuracy","Estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["communication complexity","synchronisation","underwater acoustic communication","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["asymmetrical round trip","synchronization-free localization","underwater sensor networks","UWSN","localization algorithms","underwater sensor systems","round trip based localization","computational complexity"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Large-scale underwater sensor networks","asymmetrical round trip","synchronization-free localization"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"November  2010","displayDocTitle":"Asymmetrical Round Trip Based Synchronization-Free Localization in Large-Scale Underwater Sensor Networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5581198/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 September 2010","dateOfInsertion":"11 November 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"9","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/5581198/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"11638072","publicationDate":"November 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Asymmetrical Round Trip Based Synchronization-Free Localization in Large-Scale Underwater Sensor Networks","sourcePdf":"3532-tw1011-liu.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.074711S","chronDate":"November  2010","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"5626930","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"60","xplore-issue":"5626930","articleId":"5581198","onlineDate":"23 September 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5581200,"authors":[{"name":"Vahid Asghari","affiliation":["Institut National de la Recherche Scientifique-Energie, Mat\u00e9riaux et T\u00e9l\u00e9communications (INRS-EMT), Universit\u00e9 du Qu\u00e0bec, Montreal, QUE, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/5595095/5581200/5581200-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Vahid Reza Asghari (S'07) received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from Azad Univer-sity, Tehran, Iran, in 2002, and the M.S. degree in telecommunications from K.N.

We assume a primary/secondary spectrum-sharing system where the secondary users may have access to the spectrum band originally assigned to the primary (licensed) user, as long as the interference power inflicted on the primary receiver is considered unharmful. In this context, considering joint average interference-power and peak transmit-power constraints, we first obtain the optimal power allocation scheme, namely variable power, for maximizing the achievable capacity of the secondary user over fading channels. Thereafter, we look into the variable rate and power adaptation policy by maximizing the achievable capacity under said power constraints and bit error rate requirements in multilevel quadrature amplitude modulation (M-QAM).

Our method for algorithm design draws on ideas from the classic Arimoto-Blahut algorithm. Like Arimoto-Blahut algorithm, our algorithms operate iteratively in a two-stage manner, i.e., in one iteration, the first stage is for updating test conditional probabilities, the second for updating beamforming matrices, and both stages are composed of simple convex subproblems. Optimal transmit beamforming for weighted sum rate maximization, weighted rate balancing, and proportional fair rate allocation in MIMO BC are considered. We rediscover the weighted sum-rate beamforming weighted minimum mean square error (WSRBF-WMMSE) algorithm in for MIMO BC. And we apply our method together with uplink-downlink duality to optimal beamforming for weighted rate balancing and proportional fair rate allocation in MIMO BC. We show experimentally that our algorithm for rate balancing requires less computation time to converge than existing algorithms without performance loss, and the algorithm for proportional fair rate allocation can achieve the balance between sum rate maximization and minimum rate maximization.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2010.090210.100039","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/5595095/05581201.pdf","startPage":"3247","endPage":"3257","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2010.090210.100039","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5595095","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Linear Transmission for Rate Optimization in MIMO Broadcast Channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5581201","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 September 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"October  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5581201/","displayDocTitle":"Linear Transmission for Rate Optimization in MIMO Broadcast Channels","volume":"9","issue":"10","publicationDate":"October 2010","accessionNumber":"11574419","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5581201/","dateOfInsertion":"07 October 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Linear Transmission for Rate Optimization in MIMO Broadcast Channels","sourcePdf":"3247-tw1010-wang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.113208S","chronDate":"October  2010","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"5595095","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"5595095","articleId":"5581201","onlineDate":"23 September 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5581203,"authors":[{"name":"Qi Qu","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/5595095/5581203/5581203-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Qi Qu received the B.S.E degree from the Institute of Communications and Information Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China, in June, 2002, the M.S. degree (with honors) from Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Miami, Coral Gables, FL, USA, in May, 2004, and the Ph.D. degree from the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California at San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA, in June 2008.","He spent the summer of 2006 in the ARO Center for Battlefield Communications (CeBCom) Research, Prairie View A&M University, and the summer of 2007 in NTT-DoCoMo Communication Lab, Palo Alto, USA.

Given energy, delay and data rate constraints, a source node dynamically chooses its cooperating nodes from its neighbors to form a virtual MIMO system with the destination node (which is assumed to have multiple antennas), as well as adaptively allocates the power level and adjusts the constellation size for each of the selected cooperative nodes. In order to optimize system performance, we jointly consider the optimization of all these parameters, given the aforementioned system constraints. We assume that the source node either has CSI, or has no CSI. Heuristic algorithms, such as maximal channel gain (MCG) and least channel correlation (LCC) algorithms are proposed in order to exploit available system information and to solve the constrained

To this end, we also present an analysis of channel estimation errors using correlator-based and Minimum Mean-Square Error (MMSE) channel estimators. Unlike similar works, we specifically focus on a scenario where the presence of several simultaneous, symbol-asynchronous signals makes the problem more complicated than in traditional channel estimation. In particular, we show that there is direct dependence of the channel estimation error on the instantaneous channel matrix. The model we propose in this paper makes it possible to quickly evaluate the performance of channel estimation schemes as a function of the system parameters. In this light, we include the effect of channel estimation errors in an ad hoc networking protocol simulator and thoroughly evaluate their impact. Our results show that there exists a significant interplay between the performance of MAC protocols for MIMO networks and the accuracy of channel estimation. Moreover, we show that interesting tradeoffs arise between MAC- and physical level-related parameters.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2010.090210.100512","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/5595095/05581205.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2010.090210.100512","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5595095","startPage":"3290","endPage":"3300","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Impact of Channel Estimation Errors on MAC Protocols for MIMO Ad Hoc Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5581205","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"On the Impact of Channel Estimation Errors on MAC Protocols for MIMO Ad Hoc Networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"October  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5581205/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 September 2010","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"9","issue":"10","publicationDate":"October 2010","accessionNumber":"11574410","dateOfInsertion":"07 October 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5581205/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Impact of Channel Estimation Errors on MAC Protocols for MIMO Ad Hoc Networks","sourcePdf":"3290-tw1010-chiarotto.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073982S","chronDate":"October  2010","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"5595095","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5595095","articleId":"5581205","onlineDate":"23 September 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":5581208,"authors":[{"name":"Han-Shin Jo","affiliation":["Wireless Networking and Communications Group, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Texas, Austin, Austin, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Han-Shin","lastName":"Jo","id":"37531785900"},{"name":"Cheol Mun","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Communication Engineering, Chungju National University, Chungju, South Korea"],"firstName":"Cheol","lastName":"Mun","id":"37266741300"},{"name":"June Moon","affiliation":["Telecommunication Research and Development Center, Samsung Electronics, Suwon, Gyeonggi, South Korea"],"firstName":"June","lastName":"Moon","id":"37653785700"},{"name":"Jong-Gwan Yook","affiliation":["Department of Electrical & Electronic Engineering, Yonsei University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jong-Gwan","lastName":"Yook","id":"37277003100"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1536-1276"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2248"}],"articleNumber":"5581208","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":89,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1918},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/organizations/society/sp/index.html#pub"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5581208","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Ultrafast electronics","Macrocell networks","Power control","Buildings","Analytical models","Downlink","Shadow mapping"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","probability","radio links"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["self-optimized coverage coordination","two-tier femtocell network","signal statistics","femtocell downlink","coverage leakage probability"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Femtocell","self-optimized coverage coordination","downlink power control","coverage analysis"]}],"abstract":"This paper proposes a self-optimized coverage coordination scheme for two-tier femtocell networks, in which a femtocell base station adjusts the transmit power based on the statistics of the signal and the interference power that is measured at a femtocell downlink.

Linearly time-varying channel (LTV) models have been widely used as a way of reducing the number of these channel parameters. This approach allows estimation using the channel slope and channel frequency response between symbols. A fatal problem with this approach, however, is that before it is even initiated, the estimated channel in the frequency domain has already been degraded by inter-carrier interference (ICI). We demonstrate this by analyzing the channel estimation mean square error (MSE) and signal to interference and noise ratio (SINR) after ICI cancellation with respect to the LTV model. We then propose a new channel estimation technique using dual-ICI cancellation which resolves this problem by pre-canceling ICI for the channel estimation using the channel of the previous symbol and post-canceling ICI for symbol detection with the more accurate channel information. The process is initialized using the first symbol as a preamble to estimate the channel in the time domain. Performance comparisons of MSE and SINR show that the proposed method is better suited to fast-fading channels than the conventional method, where ICI dominates the interference and noise power.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2010.090210.091458","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/5595095/05581210.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2010.090210.091458","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5595095","startPage":"3155","endPage":"3165","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"New OFDM Channel Estimation with Dual-ICI Cancellation in Highly Mobile Channel","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5581210","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"New OFDM Channel Estimation with Dual-ICI Cancellation in Highly Mobile Channel","chronOrPublicationDate":"October  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5581210/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 September 2010","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"9","issue":"10","publicationDate":"October 2010","accessionNumber":"11574437","dateOfInsertion":"07 October 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5581210/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"New OFDM Channel Estimation with Dual-ICI Cancellation in Highly Mobile Channel","sourcePdf":"3155-tw1010-kwak.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.070704S","chronDate":"October  2010","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"5595095","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"5595095","articleId":"5581210","onlineDate":"23 September 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5581211,"authors":[{"name":"Jongmin Shin","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Pohang University of Science and Technology, Pohang, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jongmin","lastName":"Shin","id":"37629824000"},{"name":"Dongmin Yang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Pohang University of Science and Technology, Pohang, South Korea"],"firstName":"Dongmin","lastName":"Yang","id":"37635912500"},{"name":"Cheeha Kim","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Pohang University of Science and Technology, Pohang, South Korea"],"firstName":"Cheeha","lastName":"Kim","id":"37350578800"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"5581211","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":97,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1005},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Synchronization","Cognitive radio","Process control","Asynchronous communication","Cathode ray tubes","IEEE 802.11 Standards","Mobile communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","radiofrequency interference","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed channel rendezvous scheme","cognitive radio network","spectrum","interference","data transmission"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cognitive radio","distributed systems","multi-channel","rendezvous sequence"]}],"abstract":"Cognitive radio networks need to utilize available spectrum in a dynamic and opportunistic fashion without causing interference to co-located primary nodes.

To combat that effect, it has been suggested to implement a reliability threshold at the relay to control error propagation. Specifically, the relay calculates log-likelihood ratio (LLR) values for the bits sent from the source. These values are subjected to a threshold to selectively forward bits that are most reliable and discard bits that are less so, resulting in less errors propagating to the destination. We investigate the application of this technique to a network-coded two-way relay channel where the relay is assisting two sources simultaneously. We first consider network-coded systems without channel coding, and then consider network-channel coded systems. We examine two modes of thresholding, one based on the individual bits, and the other based on the combined bits. We provide the full analysis for the bit-error rate (BER) performance of both thresholding modes and optimize the thresholds accordingly. We demonstrate that the optimum thresholds based on both modes give similar performances and are far better than the case of no thresholding. We also consider the performance of the proposed thresholding techniques for network-channel coded systems. We present several numerical examples that illustrate the efficacy of employing thresholding at the relay nodes (for networks with and without channel coding).","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"November  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5581212/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 September 2010","volume":"9","issue":"11","accessionNumber":"11638087","publicationDate":"November 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5581212/","dateOfInsertion":"11 November 2010","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Mitigating Error Propagation in Two-Way Relay Channels with Network Coding","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mitigating Error Propagation in Two-Way Relay Channels with Network Coding","sourcePdf":"3380-tw1011-nguyen.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.096014S","chronDate":"November  2010","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"5626930","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"40","xplore-issue":"5626930","articleId":"5581212","onlineDate":"23 September 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5581324,"authors":[{"name":"Kyu Ho Park","affiliation":["Computer Engineering Research Laboratory, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, South Korea"],"firstName":"Kyu Ho","lastName":"Park","id":"37281165700"},{"name":"Youngwoo Park","affiliation":["Computer Engineering Research Laboratory, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, South Korea"],"firstName":"Youngwoo","lastName":"Park","id":"37540026300"},{"name":"Woomin Hwang","affiliation":["Computer Engineering Research Laboratory, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, South Korea"],"firstName":"Woomin","lastName":"Hwang","id":"37528330800"},{"name":"Ki-Woong Park","affiliation":["Computer Engineering Research Laboratory, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, South Korea"],"firstName":"Ki-Woong","lastName":"Park","id":"37539844500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8335-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4214-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5581324","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":284},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MN-Mate: Resource Management of Manycores with DRAM and Nonvolatile Memories","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE 12th International Conference on High Performance Computing and Communications (HPCC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5581177/5581318/05581324.pdf","startPage":"24","endPage":"34","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE 12th International Conference on High Performance Computing and Communications (HPCC)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HPCC.2010.35","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5581318","doi":"10.1109/HPCC.2010.35","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Virtual machine monitors","Random access memory","Memory management","Nonvolatile memory","Monitoring","Hardware"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiprocessing systems","random-access storage","resource allocation","storage management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MN-Mate","manycores resource management","DRAM","nonvolatile memories","energy consumption","NVRAM","DRAM","hypervisor"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Manycore","Hypervisor","PRAM"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5581324","abstract":"The advent of many core era breaks the performance wall but it causes severe energy consumption. NVRAM as a main memory can be a good solution to reduce energy consumption due to large size of DRAM. In this paper, we propose MN-MATE, a novel architecture and management techniques for resource allocation of a number of cores and large size of DRAM and NVRAM. In MN-MATE, a hyper visor partitions and allocates cores and memory for guest OSes dynamically. It is clear that optimized matching of heterogeneous cores, DRAM, and NVRAM enhances system performance. Selective locating of data in a main memory composed of DRAM and NVRAM significantly reduces energy consumptions. Preliminary results show that integration of dynamic resource partitioning and selective memory allocation scheme with MN-MATE reduces energy usage significantly and suppresses performance loss from NVRAM's characteristics.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5581324/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 Sept. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11559352","htmlLink":"/document/5581324/","dateOfInsertion":"27 September 2010","conferenceDate":"1-3 Sept. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"MN-Mate: Resource Management of Manycores with DRAM and Nonvolatile Memories","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MN-Mate: Resource Management of Manycores with DRAM and Nonvolatile Memories","confLoc":"Melbourne, VIC, Australia","sourcePdf":"4214a024.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.085722S","chronDate":"1-3 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5581177","isNumber":"5581318","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5581177","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5581318","articleId":"5581324","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5581340,"authors":[{"name":"Michael Mattess","affiliation":["Cloud Computing and Distributed Computing (CLOUDS) Laboratory, Department of Computer Science and Software Engineering, University of Melbourne, Australia"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Mattess","id":"38193946700"},{"name":"Christian Vecchiola","affiliation":["Cloud Computing and Distributed Computing (CLOUDS) Laboratory, Department of Computer Science and Software Engineering, University of Melbourne, Australia"],"firstName":"Christian","lastName":"Vecchiola","id":"37550108600"},{"name":"Rajkumar Buyya","affiliation":["Cloud Computing and Distributed Computing (CLOUDS) Laboratory, Department of Computer Science and Software Engineering, University of Melbourne, Australia"],"firstName":"Rajkumar","lastName":"Buyya","id":"37267557900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8335-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4214-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5581340","dbTime":"44 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":60,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":525},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Clouds","Prediction algorithms","Cloud computing","Data models","History","Arrays","Heuristic algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Internet","marketing data processing","pricing","purchasing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["peak load management","cloud infrastructure service","spot market","dedicated computing cluster","economics","purchasing","virtual infrastructure","cost saving"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cloud computing"]}],"abstract":"Dedicated computing clusters are typically sized based on an expected average workload over a period of years, rather than on peak workloads, which might exist for relatively short times of weeks or months. Recent work has proposed temporarily adding capacity to dedicated clusters during peak periods, by purchasing additional resources from Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) providers such as Amazon's EC2. In this paper, we consider the economics of purchasing such resources by taking advantage of new opportunities offered for renting virtual infrastructure such as the spot pricing model introduced by Amazon. Furthermore, we define different provisioning policies and investigate the use of spot instances compared to normal instances in terms of cost savings and total breach time of tasks in the queue.","doi":"10.1109/HPCC.2010.77","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE 12th International Conference on High Performance Computing and Communications (HPCC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE 12th International Conference on High Performance Computing and Communications (HPCC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5581177/5581318/05581340.pdf","startPage":"180","endPage":"188","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HPCC.2010.77","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5581318","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Managing Peak Loads by Leasing Cloud Infrastructure Services from a Spot Market","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5581340","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 Sept. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5581340/","displayDocTitle":"Managing Peak Loads by Leasing Cloud Infrastructure Services from a Spot Market","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11559393","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5581340/","conferenceDate":"1-3 Sept. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"27 September 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Managing Peak Loads by Leasing Cloud Infrastructure Services from a Spot Market","confLoc":"Melbourne, VIC, Australia","sourcePdf":"4214a180.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047366S","chronDate":"1-3 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5581177","isNumber":"5581318","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5581177","citationCount":"60","xplore-issue":"5581318","articleId":"5581340","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5581397,"authors":[{"name":"Heung-Il Suk","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Korea University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Heung-Il","lastName":"Suk","id":"37401288500"},{"name":"Seong-Whan Lee","affiliation":["Department of Brain and Cognitive Engineering, Korea University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Seong-Whan","lastName":"Lee","id":"37281134700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8486-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4133-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5581397","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":469},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hidden Markov models","Electroencephalography","Feature extraction","Brain modeling","Training","Time domain analysis","Principal component analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["brain-computer interfaces","electroencephalography","hidden Markov models","medical signal processing","signal classification"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["two-layer hidden Markov models","multiclass motor imagery classification","high dimensional space classification","multiple electrode signal","EEG-based BCI","EEG signal probabilistic classification","holistic task-related dynamic EEG patterns","brain-computer interface"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["brain-computer interface (BCI)","Hidden Markov Models (HMMs)","electroencephalography (EEG)","motor Imagery classification"]}],"abstract":"Classifiers in a high dimensional space based on the signals of multiple electrodes in EEG-based BCIs suffer from the curse of dimensionality due to the limited training dataset.

We show that the combination of linear spatial filtering and resampling-based learning increases robustness and classification accuracy. Second the idle state identification issue in BCI is studied. We demonstrate that its explicit definition using data recorded between trials improves mental states decoding.

However, one of the major challenges that faces the cloud computing concept and its global acceptance is how to secure and protect the data and processes that are the property of the user. The security of the cloud computing environment is a new research area requiring further development by both the academic and industrial research communities. Today, there are many diverse and uncoordinated efforts underway to address security issues in cloud computing and, especially, the identity management issues. This paper introduces an architecture for a new approach to necessary \u201cmutual protection\u201d in the cloud computing environment, based upon a concept of mutual trust and the specification of definable profiles in vector matrix form. The architecture aims to achieve better, more generic and flexible authentication, authorization and control, based on a concept of mutuality, within that cloud computing environment.","doi":"10.1109/HPCC.2010.87","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE 12th International Conference on High Performance Computing and Communications (HPCC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE 12th International Conference on High Performance Computing and Communications (HPCC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5581177/5581318/05581429.pdf","startPage":"641","endPage":"646","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HPCC.2010.87","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5581318","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Mutual Protection in a Cloud Computing Environment","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5581429","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 Sept. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5581429/","displayDocTitle":"Mutual Protection in a Cloud Computing Environment","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11559382","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5581429/","conferenceDate":"1-3 Sept. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"27 September 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mutual Protection in a Cloud Computing Environment","confLoc":"Melbourne, VIC, Australia","sourcePdf":"4214a641.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045218S","chronDate":"1-3 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5581177","isNumber":"5581318","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5581177","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"5581318","articleId":"5581429","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":5581433,"authors":[{"name":"Rashidul Hasan","affiliation":["Gippsland School of Information Technology, Monash University, Churchill, VIC, Australia"],"firstName":"Rashidul","lastName":"Hasan","id":"37895773900"},{"name":"Manzur Murshed","affiliation":["Gippsland School of Information Technology, Monash University, Churchill, VIC, Australia"],"firstName":"Manzur","lastName":"Murshed","id":"37272889700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8335-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4214-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5581433","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":195},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wireless LAN","Sensors","Chromium","Delay","Channel estimation","Mathematical model","Cognitive radio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["carrier sense multiple access","cognitive radio","delays","jitter","quality of service","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["delay sensitive services","cognitive radio networks","sharing spectrum","CSMA/CA networks","delays","jitters","channel availability","QoS","WLAN","primary channels"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cognitive Radio","WLAN","spectrum opportunity"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Provisioning Delay Sensitive Services in Cognitive Radio Networks by Opportunistically Sharing Spectrum from CSMA/CA Networks","doi":"10.1109/HPCC.2010.73","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5581318","endPage":"622","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE 12th International Conference on High Performance Computing and Communications (HPCC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE 12th International Conference on High Performance Computing and Communications (HPCC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5581177/5581318/05581433.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HPCC.2010.73","startPage":"616","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5581433","abstract":"Cognitive radio network (CRN) users are inherently expected to experience widely varied delays and jitters due to the uncertainty in channel availability. Supporting delay sensitive real-time services through CRNs thus remains a challenging task. This paper presents a novel technique to provision QoS guarantee in CRNs by modeling the resultant channel of multiple primary networks and finding the optimum number of primary channels to support a desired level of expected latency. In doing so, this paper introduces a cognitive radio based MAC, which can effectively co-exists with primary CSMA/CA networks by accurately estimating the start of the spectrum holes, reliably modeling channel occupation by the primary users, and using event-driven sensing to adaptively control the sensing frequency and interval. Simulation results with ns-2.33 reveal that a CR network based on the proposed MAC can achieve the targeted service delay time by appropriately selecting optimal WLAN primary channels.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5581433/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 Sept. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"27 September 2010","accessionNumber":"11559392","htmlLink":"/document/5581433/","conferenceDate":"1-3 Sept. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Provisioning Delay Sensitive Services in Cognitive Radio Networks by Opportunistically Sharing Spectrum from CSMA/CA Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Provisioning Delay Sensitive Services in Cognitive Radio Networks by Opportunistically Sharing Spectrum from CSMA/CA Networks","confLoc":"Melbourne, VIC, Australia","sourcePdf":"4214a616.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048232S","chronDate":"1-3 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5581177","isNumber":"5581318","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5581177","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5581318","articleId":"5581433","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":5581441,"authors":[{"name":"Weijiang Liu","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Technology, Dalian Maritime University, Dalian, Liaoning, China"],"firstName":"Weijiang","lastName":"Liu","id":"37676216100"},{"name":"Wenyu Qu","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Technology, Dalian Maritime University, Dalian, Liaoning, China"],"firstName":"Wenyu","lastName":"Qu","id":"37266701400"},{"name":"Zhaobin Liu","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Technology, Dalian Maritime University, Dalian, Liaoning, China"],"firstName":"Zhaobin","lastName":"Liu","id":"37593006600"},{"name":"Keqiu Li","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Dalian University of Technology, Dalian, China"],"firstName":"Keqiu","lastName":"Li","id":"37277619000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8335-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4214-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5581441","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":105},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5581441","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Estimation","Equations","Mathematical model","Accuracy","Scalability","Trajectory","Least squares methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["IP networks","sampling methods","statistical analysis","telecommunication traffic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["flow length distribution estimation","double-sampled flow statistics","traffic statistics","passive traffic measurement","traffic flows","network link","traffic demands","source traffic","traffic anomalies","statistical inference","IP flows","packet sampling"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["double sampling","IP flows","estimation","length distribution"]}],"abstract":"Since the generation of detailed traffic statistics does not scale well with link speed, increasingly passive traffic measurement employs sampling at the packet or flow level. Sampling has become an attractive and scalable means to measure flow data on high-speed links. However, knowing the length distributions of traffic flows passing through a network link is useful for some applications such as inferring traffic demands, characterizing source traffic, and detecting traffic anomalies. Passive traffic measurement increasingly makes inferences from sampled network traffic. However, previous work has shown the inaccuracy of estimating flow length distributions from sampled traffic when the sampling is performed at the packet level. In this paper, we propose a novel method that uses flow statistics formed from double-sampled packet stream to infer the absolute frequencies of lengths of flows in the unsampled stream. We achieve this through statistical inference and by exploiting heavy-tailed feather. The method allow us to recover the complete flow length distribution.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5581318","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HPCC.2010.63","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE 12th International Conference on High Performance Computing and Communications (HPCC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE 12th International Conference on High Performance Computing and Communications (HPCC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5581177/5581318/05581441.pdf","startPage":"568","endPage":"572","doi":"10.1109/HPCC.2010.63","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Novel Method for Estimating Flow Length Distributions from Double-Sampled Flow Statistics","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 Sept. 2010","displayDocTitle":"A Novel Method for Estimating Flow Length Distributions from Double-Sampled Flow Statistics","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"1-3 Sept. 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5581441/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11559401","dateOfInsertion":"27 September 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5581441/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel Method for Estimating Flow Length Distributions from Double-Sampled Flow Statistics","confLoc":"Melbourne, VIC, Australia","sourcePdf":"4214a568.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062205S","chronDate":"1-3 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5581177","isNumber":"5581318","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5581177","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5581318","articleId":"5581441","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":5581463,"authors":[{"name":"Steven Solomon","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, MAN, Canada"],"firstName":"Steven","lastName":"Solomon","id":"37393179100"},{"name":"Parimala Thulasiraman","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, MAN, Canada"],"firstName":"Parimala","lastName":"Thulasiraman","id":"37282667200"},{"name":"Ruppa K.

However, a significant level of interest has been focused on algorithms for solving regular problems, as these applications typically map well to the GPU. Irregular applications, which rely on pointer or graph-based data structures, have not been as extensively studied and are significantly more difficult to implement or map in an efficient fashion on the GPU. In this paper, we consider a graph-based maximum flow algorithm that has applications in network optimization problems. In the literature, the push-relabel maximum flow algorithm has been considered on the GPU. We believe that Malhotra, Pramodh Kumar and Maheshwari's algorithm is better suited for the GPU due to the synchronous, iterative nature of the algorithm. As a result, we choose this algorithm for our study. We show that the performance of the GPU algorithm far exceeds that of a sequential CPU algorithm.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Exploiting Parallelism in Iterative Irregular Maxflow Computations on GPU Accelerators","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE 12th International Conference on High Performance Computing and Communications (HPCC)","doi":"10.1109/HPCC.2010.44","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE 12th International Conference on High Performance Computing and Communications (HPCC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5581177/5581318/05581463.pdf","startPage":"297","endPage":"304","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HPCC.2010.44","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5581318","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5581463","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5581463/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 Sept. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Exploiting Parallelism in Iterative Irregular Maxflow Computations on GPU Accelerators","conferenceDate":"1-3 Sept. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5581463/","dateOfInsertion":"27 September 2010","publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11559330","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Exploiting Parallelism in Iterative Irregular Maxflow Computations on GPU Accelerators","confLoc":"Melbourne, VIC, Australia","sourcePdf":"4214a297.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062136S","chronDate":"1-3 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5581177","isNumber":"5581318","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5581177","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5581318","articleId":"5581463","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5581488,"authors":[{"name":"Slo-Li Chu","affiliation":["Department of Information and Computer Engineering, Chung Yuan Christian University, Chungli, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Slo-Li","lastName":"Chu","id":"37277049200"},{"name":"Chih-Chieh Hsiao","affiliation":["Department of Information and Computer Engineering, Chung Yuan Christian University, Chungli, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chih-Chieh","lastName":"Hsiao","id":"38194493700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8335-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4214-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5581488","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":541},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"OpenCL: Make Ubiquitous Supercomputing Possible","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5581488","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computer architecture","Graphics processing unit","Instruction sets","Kernel","Microprocessors","Sun"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["coprocessors","message passing","multiprocessing systems","parallel machines","parallel programming","ubiquitous computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["OpenCL","ubiquitous supercomputing","3D games","general-purpose graphics processing unit","programming paradigms","open standard","universal API","OpenMP"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Parallel Programming","OpenCL","OpenMP","GPU","GPGPU","Supercomputing"]}],"abstract":"Due to the dramatic requirements of 3D games and applications, graphics processing unit (GPU) or general-purpose graphics processing unit (GPGPU) have become required components in the modern computer systems. While these devices enable high parallelism with huge amount of processing elements, the utilization of their capabilities in general scientific applications are still low due to their difficult programming paradigms. Therefore an open standard, OpenCL, is proposed to provide universal APIs and programming paradigms for various GPUs and accelerators. In this study, it adopts several benchmarks, with various computation characteristics, to demonstrate the capabilities of OpenCL with several platforms. These programs are parallelized by OpenMP and OpenCL, and then targeted on several GPUs and conventional servers. This paper also provides an example to illustrate the migration of the given program, from OpenMP to OpenCL. The presented experimental results show that these inexpensive GPUs will lead better performance than servers if adopt OpenCL paradigms. It will be the preliminary milestone of cheap supercomputing by the acceleration of GPUs that can be obtained ubiquitously.","doi":"10.1109/HPCC.2010.56","startPage":"556","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE 12th International Conference on High Performance Computing and Communications (HPCC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE 12th International Conference on High Performance Computing and Communications (HPCC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5581177/5581318/05581488.pdf","endPage":"561","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5581318","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HPCC.2010.56","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"1-3 Sept. 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 Sept. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5581488/","displayDocTitle":"OpenCL: Make Ubiquitous Supercomputing Possible","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"27 September 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5581488/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11559369","publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"OpenCL: Make Ubiquitous Supercomputing Possible","confLoc":"Melbourne, VIC, Australia","sourcePdf":"4214a556.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039912S","chronDate":"1-3 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5581177","isNumber":"5581318","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5581177","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5581318","articleId":"5581488","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5581555,"authors":[{"name":"Shan Li","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, George Washington University, USA"],"firstName":"Shan","lastName":"Li","id":"37715564700"},{"name":"H.

An accurate SSD performance model will provide the important research tools for exploring the design space of flash-based storage systems. While many HDD performance models have been developed, architectural differences prevent these models from being effective for SSDs, mostly because their designs cannot accurately account for many unique SSD characteristics (e.g., low latencies, slow updates, and expensive erases). In this paper, we utilize the black-box modeling technique to analyze and evaluate SSD performance, including latency, bandwidth, and throughput. Such an approach is appealing because it requires minimal a priori information about SSDs. We construct and evaluate our models on three commercial SSDs. Although this approach may lead to less accurate predictions for HDDs, we find that a black-box model with a comprehensive set of workload characteristics can achieve the mean relative errors of 20%, 13%, and 6% for latency, bandwidth, and throughput predictions, respectively.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5581555/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 Aug. 2010","publicationDate":"Aug. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"17-19 Aug. 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5581555/","dateOfInsertion":"23 September 2010","accessionNumber":"11554112","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Black-Box Performance Modeling for Solid-State Drives","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Black-Box Performance Modeling for Solid-State Drives","confLoc":"Miami Beach, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"4197a391.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047855S","chronDate":"17-19 Aug. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5581171","isNumber":"5581351","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5581171","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"5581351","articleId":"5581555","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5581577,"authors":[{"name":"Sylvain Collange","affiliation":["ELIAUS-PROMES, UPVD, Perpignan, France"],"firstName":"Sylvain","lastName":"Collange","id":"37659363700"},{"name":"Marc Daumas","affiliation":["ELIAUS-PROMES, UPVD, Perpignan, France"],"firstName":"Marc","lastName":"Daumas","id":"37369897500"},{"name":"David Defour","affiliation":["ELIAUS-PROMES, UPVD, Perpignan, France"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Defour","id":"37659363800"},{"name":"David Parello","affiliation":["ELIAUS-PROMES, UPVD, Perpignan, France"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Parello","id":"37938030500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8181-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2375-0227"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1526-7539"}],"articleNumber":"5581577","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":52,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":496},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Graphics processing unit","Registers","Computational modeling","Computer architecture","Instruction sets","Hardware","Load modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer graphic equipment","coprocessors","digital simulation","parallel processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Barra","parallel functional simulator","GPGPU","graphics processing units","general purpose processing","UNISIM framework","native instruction set","Tesla architecture","CUDA executables","NVIDIA tools"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["GPU","GPGPU","UNISIM","CUDA"]}],"abstract":"We present Barra, a simulator of Graphics Processing Units (GPU) tuned for general purpose processing (GPGPU).

We use it to understand and explore the micro-architecture design spaces of GPUs.","doi":"10.1109/MASCOTS.2010.43","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Symposium on Modeling, Analysis and Simulation of Computer and Telecommunication Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Symposium on Modeling, Analysis and Simulation of Computer and Telecommunication Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5581171/5581351/05581577.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MASCOTS.2010.43","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5581351","startPage":"351","endPage":"360","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Barra: A Parallel Functional Simulator for GPGPU","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5581577","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Barra: A Parallel Functional Simulator for GPGPU","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 Aug. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5581577/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"17-19 Aug. 2010","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2010","accessionNumber":"11554101","dateOfInsertion":"23 September 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5581577/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Barra: A Parallel Functional Simulator for GPGPU","confLoc":"Miami Beach, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"4197a351.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.081976S","chronDate":"17-19 Aug. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5581171","isNumber":"5581351","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5581171","citationCount":"52","xplore-issue":"5581351","articleId":"5581577","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5581579,"authors":[{"name":"Prasad Calyam","affiliation":["Ohio Supercomputer Centre/OARnet, Ohio State Uinversity, USA"],"firstName":"Prasad","lastName":"Calyam","id":"37393638800"},{"name":"Jialu Pu","affiliation":["Ohio Supercomputer Centre/OARnet, Ohio State Uinversity, USA"],"firstName":"Jialu","lastName":"Pu","id":"38193507800"},{"name":"Weiping Mandrawa","affiliation":["Ohio Supercomputer Centre/OARnet, Ohio State Uinversity, USA"],"firstName":"Weiping","lastName":"Mandrawa","id":"38193053400"},{"name":"Ashok Krishnamurthy","affiliation":["Ohio Supercomputer Centre/OARnet, Ohio State Uinversity, USA"],"firstName":"Ashok","lastName":"Krishnamurthy","id":"37269415800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8181-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2375-0227"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1526-7539"}],"articleNumber":"5581579","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":174},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Current measurement","Monitoring","Sensitivity","Accuracy","Communities","Throughput"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computerised monitoring","sonar","telecommunication computing","telecommunication network management","Web services"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dynamic network anomaly notification","perfSONAR deployments","large-scale data transfers","measurement frameworks","Web-services","data archives","end-to-end multidomain network paths","automated techniques","intuitive tools","dynamically adaptive plateau-detection scheme","perfSONAR measurements","data-intensive scientific communities","network anomaly detection","OnTimeDetect tool"]}],"abstract":"To monitor and diagnose bottlenecks on network paths used for large-scale data transfers, there is an increasing trend to deploy measurement frameworks such as perfSONAR. These deployments use Web-services to expose vast data archives of current and historic measurements, which can be queried across end-to-end multi-domain network paths. Consequently, there has arisen a need to develop automated techniques and intuitive tools that help analyze these measurements for detecting and notifying prominent network anomalies such as plateaus in both real-time and offline manner. In this paper, we present a dynamically adaptive plateau-detection (APD) scheme and its implementation in our \u201cOnTimeDetect\u201d tool to enable consumers of perfSONAR measurements within the data-intensive scientific communities in overcoming their existing limitations of network anomaly detection and notification.

The key is to cohesively exploit the NAND flash memory device write speed vs. raw storage reliability trade-off at the physical layer and run-time data access workload variation at the system level. Leveraging run-time data access workload variation, we can opportunistically slow down NAND flash memory write speed and hence improve NAND flash memory raw storage reliability. This naturally enables an opportunistic use of weaker error correction schemes that can directly reduce SSD read access latency. We develop a disk-level scheduling scheme to effectively smooth the write workload in order to maximize the occurrence of run-time opportunistic NAND flash memory write slow down.

In this paper, we present a novel pattern driven application consolidation (PAC) system to achieve efficient resource sharing in virtualized cloud computing infrastructures.

PAC then performs dynamic application consolidation based on the extracted signatures. We have implemented a prototype of the PAC system on top of the Xen virtual machine platform and tested it on the NCSU Virtual Computing Lab. We have tested our system using RUBiS benchmarks, Hadoop data processing systems, and IBM System S stream processing system. Our experiments show that 1) PAC can efficiently discover repeating resource usage patterns in the tested applications; 2) Signatures can reduce resource prediction errors by 50-90% compared to traditional coarse-grained schemes; 3) PAC can improve application performance by up to 50% when running a large number of applications on a shared cluster.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"PAC: Pattern-driven Application Consolidation for Efficient Cloud Computing","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Symposium on Modeling, Analysis and Simulation of Computer and Telecommunication Systems","doi":"10.1109/MASCOTS.2010.12","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Symposium on Modeling, Analysis and Simulation of Computer and Telecommunication Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5581171/5581351/05581610.pdf","startPage":"24","endPage":"33","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MASCOTS.2010.12","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5581351","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5581610","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5581610/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 Aug. 2010","displayDocTitle":"PAC: Pattern-driven Application Consolidation for Efficient Cloud Computing","conferenceDate":"17-19 Aug. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5581610/","dateOfInsertion":"23 September 2010","publicationDate":"Aug. 2010","accessionNumber":"11554106","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"PAC: Pattern-driven Application Consolidation for Efficient Cloud Computing","confLoc":"Miami Beach, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"4197a024.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.082653S","chronDate":"17-19 Aug. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5581171","isNumber":"5581351","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5581171","citationCount":"54","xplore-issue":"5581351","articleId":"5581610","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5581614,"authors":[{"name":"Yangwook Kang","affiliation":["Storage Systems Research Center, University of California, Santa Cruz, USA"],"firstName":"Yangwook","lastName":"Kang","id":"37713307000"},{"name":"Jingpei Yang","affiliation":["Storage Systems Research Center, University of California, Santa Cruz, USA"],"firstName":"Jingpei","lastName":"Yang","id":"37716105200"},{"name":"Ethan L.

However, replacing hard drives with flash memory in current systems often either requires major file system changes or causes performance degradation due to the limitations of block-based interface and out-of-place updates required by flash. To alleviate this problem, we propose an object-based model for flash memory that gives the hardware and firmware the ability to optimize performance for the underlying implementation. Based on this model, we propose two new data placement policies that exploit richer information from an object-based interface. Using simulation, we show that cleaning overhead can be reduced by up to 9% by separating data and metadata.

Using hardware emulation such as FPGA can have higher simulation speed. However, it is very hard to debug due to its poor visibility. FPGA-based cosimulation seems to draw a balance, but Design Under Test (DUT) still resides in FPGA and remains hard for debugging. So a run-time RTL debugging methodology for FPGA-assisted verification system is presented. This method provides internal nodes probing on an event-driven cosimulation platform and achieves full observability for DUT. The debugging tools are embedded in HDL simulator using Verilog VPI callback, so signals of testbench and internal nodes of DUT can be observed in a single waveform and updated as simulation runs, making debugging more efficient. The proposed debugging method connects internal nodes directly to a PCI-extended bus, instead of inserting extra scan-chain logic, so the overhead for area is reduced. Our experiment shows that, compared with a similar method in, the area overhead for debug logic is reduced by 30~50% and compile time is shortened by 40~70%.","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Communications, Circuits and Systems (ICCCAS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5570016/5581842/05581847.pdf","startPage":"891","endPage":"895","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Communications, Circuits and Systems (ICCCAS)","doi":"10.1109/ICCCAS.2010.5581847","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCCAS.2010.5581847","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5581842","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5581847","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A run-time RTL debugging methodology for FPGA-based co-simulation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hardware design languages","Logic gates","Field programmable gate arrays","Debugging","Synchronization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","hardware description languages","integrated circuit testing","program verification","system-on-chip"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FPGA-assisted verification","run-time RTL debugging","logic simulation","SoC verification","controllability","observability","hardware emulation","internal nodes probing","event-driven cosimulation","HDL simulator","Verilog VPI callback","device under test","PCI-extended bus","scan-chain logic"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5581847/","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 July 2010","displayDocTitle":"A run-time RTL debugging methodology for FPGA-based co-simulation","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5581847/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2010","accessionNumber":"11555548","dateOfInsertion":"23 September 2010","conferenceDate":"28-30 July 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A run-time RTL debugging methodology for FPGA-based co-simulation","confLoc":"Chengdu, China","sourcePdf":"100802891895.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052328S","chronDate":"28-30 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5570016","isNumber":"5581842","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5570016","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"5581842","articleId":"5581847","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5581856,"authors":[{"name":"Zeng Wang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Technology, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China","Tsinghua National Laboratory for Information Science and Technology, China"],"lastName":"Zeng Wang","id":"38195345000"},{"name":"Yuchun Ma","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Technology, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China","Tsinghua National Laboratory for Information Science and Technology, China"],"lastName":"Yuchun Ma","id":"37274225700"},{"name":"Sheqin Dong","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Technology, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China","Tsinghua National Laboratory for Information Science and Technology, China"],"lastName":"Sheqin Dong","id":"37273416000"},{"name":"Yu Wang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Technology, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China","Tsinghua National Laboratory for Information Science and Technology, China"],"lastName":"Yu Wang","id":"37293645500"},{"name":"Xianlong Hong","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Technology, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China","Tsinghua National Laboratory for Information Science and Technology, China"],"lastName":"Xianlong Hong","id":"37275521800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8225-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8224-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-8223-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5581856","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":126},"abstract":"The flip-chip package gives the highest chip density of any packaging method to support the pad-limited ASIC design. One of the most important characteristics of flip-chip designs is that the input/output buffers could be placed anywhere inside a chip. We need to focus on not only the assignment of I/O bumps, but also the cost for placing I/O buffer blocks into the design. In this paper, we first introduce the incremental floorplanning problem for the flip-chip design in which the white space of the packings can be optimized to favor the insertion of I/O buffers. So that the initial packing results can be migrated to be matched up with the flip-chip package pattern without sacrificing much of the previous optimization in the original designs. We then present min cost flow based algorithms for I/O buffer insertion which optimize the I/O assignment in terms of interconnect cost. The experimental results have shown that our algorithm can improve wirelength by about 20% while the Power/Groud(P/G) buffers and signal I/O buffers are distributed more evenly.","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Communications, Circuits and Systems (ICCCAS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5570016/5581842/05581856.pdf","startPage":"866","endPage":"870","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Communications, Circuits and Systems (ICCCAS)","doi":"10.1109/ICCCAS.2010.5581856","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCCAS.2010.5581856","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5581842","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5581856","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Incremental I/O planning with white space redistribution for flip-chip design","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Random access memory","Convergence"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["application specific integrated circuits","circuit layout","flip-chip devices","integrated circuit design","integrated circuit interconnections"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["incremental I/O planning","white space redistribution","flip-chip design","flip-chip package","chip density","pad-limited ASIC design","incremental floorplanning problem"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5581856/","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 July 2010","displayDocTitle":"Incremental I/O planning with white space redistribution for flip-chip design","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5581856/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2010","accessionNumber":"11555595","dateOfInsertion":"23 September 2010","conferenceDate":"28-30 July 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Incremental I/O planning with white space redistribution for flip-chip design","confLoc":"Chengdu, China","sourcePdf":"100401866870.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.097392S","chronDate":"28-30 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5570016","isNumber":"5581842","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5570016","xplore-issue":"5581842","articleId":"5581856","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5581862,"authors":[{"name":"Yongbin Yu","affiliation":["Faculty of School of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology, Chengdu, Sichuan, China"],"firstName":"Yongbin","lastName":"Yu","id":"37879579100"},{"name":"Ju Jin","affiliation":["School of Life Science and Technology, University of Electronic Science and Technology, Chengdu, Sichuan, China"],"lastName":"Ju Jin","id":"38195684400"},{"name":"Fengli Zhang","affiliation":["Faculty of School of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology, Chengdu, Sichuan, China"],"firstName":"Fengli","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37858515500"},{"name":"Qishui Zhong","affiliation":["Faculty of Institute of Astronautics and Aeronautics, University of Electronic Science and Technology, Chengdu, Sichuan, China"],"firstName":"Qishui","lastName":"Zhong","id":"37873308000"},{"name":"Sheng Su","affiliation":["Faculty of School of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology, Chengdu, Sichuan, China"],"lastName":"Sheng Su","id":"38195710700"},{"name":"Juebang Yu","affiliation":["Faculty of School of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology, Chengdu, Sichuan, China"],"firstName":"Juebang","lastName":"Yu","id":"37278392500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8225-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8224-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-8223-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5581862","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":288},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Convergence"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["memristors","oscillators","stability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["memristor oscillator","memristive devices","nonlinear systems","hybrid memristive system","globally exponential stability","impulsive control memristive systems"]}],"abstract":"This work reviews the memristor and its characteristics and provides an impulsive model of memristor oscillators which helps us to develop memristive devices and nonlinear systems.

In this paper, by starting from basic memristor device equations that assumes constant ion mobility, we develop a comprehensive set of properties and design equations for memristor based memories. Our analyses are specifically targeting key electrical memristor device characteristics relevant to, but not limited to, memory operations. However, like many nano devices, a small voltage drop across the memristor will yield an enormous electric field, which may produce significant highly nonlinear ionic transport that the linear drift assumption no longer holds for realistic memristors. Issues such as how to design circuits facing such nonlinear drift will be discussed. In addition, issues such as how to sense the memory states and perturbations during sensing will be addressed. In this paper, we demonstrate that we can successfully use the derived properties based on the linear drift model to design read and write circuits and analyze important data integrity and noise-tolerance issues for realistic nonlinear drift models.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Memristor system properties and its design applications to circuits such as nonvolatile memristor memories","doi":"10.1109/ICCCAS.2010.5581867","startPage":"805","endPage":"810","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCCAS.2010.5581867","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5581842","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Communications, Circuits and Systems (ICCCAS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Communications, Circuits and Systems (ICCCAS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5570016/5581842/05581867.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5581867","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5581867/","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 July 2010","displayDocTitle":"Memristor system properties and its design applications to circuits such as nonvolatile memristor memories","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5581867/","dateOfInsertion":"23 September 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2010","accessionNumber":"11555600","conferenceDate":"28-30 July 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Memristor system properties and its design applications to circuits such as nonvolatile memristor memories","confLoc":"Chengdu, China","sourcePdf":"090101805810.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.079179S","chronDate":"28-30 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5570016","isNumber":"5581842","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5570016","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5581842","articleId":"5581867","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5581868,"authors":[{"name":"Yiran Chen","affiliation":["Alternative Technology Group, Seagate Technologies, Inc., Shakopee, MN, USA"],"firstName":"Yiran","lastName":"Chen","id":"37281023800"},{"name":"Hai Li","affiliation":["Six MetroTech Center, Polytechnic Institute of New York University, Brooklyn, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Hai","lastName":"Li","id":"37067564500"},{"name":"Xiaobin Wang","affiliation":["Alternative Technology Group, Seagate Technologies, Inc., Shakopee, MN, USA"],"firstName":"Xiaobin","lastName":"Wang","id":"37311498100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8225-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8224-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-8223-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5581868","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":920},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Magnetic domains","Memristors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["magnetoelectronics","memristors","random-access storage"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["spintronic device","passive circuit element","nonvolatile memory design","spin-transfer torque random access memory spintronic memristor"]}],"abstract":"In 1971, Professor Leon Chua in UC Berkeley predicted the fourth fundamental passive circuit element - memristor, based on the conceptual completeness of circuit theory. 37 years later, a team at HP Labs led by Dr. Stanley Williams announced the development of the first switching memristor.

On the top of that, we will also discuss one type of memsitors based on spintronic technology (spintronic memristor), including the device modeling and the applications in sensor.","doi":"10.1109/ICCCAS.2010.5581868","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Communications, Circuits and Systems (ICCCAS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Communications, Circuits and Systems (ICCCAS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5570016/5581842/05581868.pdf","startPage":"811","endPage":"816","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5581842","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCCAS.2010.5581868","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spintronic devices: From memory to memristor","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5581868","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 July 2010","displayDocTitle":"Spintronic devices: From memory to memristor","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5581868/","publicationDate":"July 2010","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"23 September 2010","accessionNumber":"11555601","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5581868/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"28-30 July 2010","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spintronic devices: From memory to memristor","confLoc":"Chengdu, China","sourcePdf":"090102811816.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072735S","chronDate":"28-30 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5570016","isNumber":"5581842","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5570016","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5581842","articleId":"5581868","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5581870,"authors":[{"name":"Ying Wang","affiliation":["Department of Information Science and Electronic Engineering, University of Zhejiang, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China"],"lastName":"Ying Wang","id":"37087146147"},{"name":"Lei Xie","affiliation":["Department of Information Science and Electronic Engineering, University of Zhejiang, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China"],"lastName":"Lei Xie","id":"37087162330"},{"name":"Zhe Wang","affiliation":["Department of Information Science and Electronic Engineering, University of Zhejiang, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China"],"lastName":"Zhe Wang","id":"37087162437"},{"name":"Huifang Chen","affiliation":["Department of Information Science and Electronic Engineering, University of Zhejiang, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China"],"lastName":"Huifang Chen","id":"37087161245"},{"name":"Kuang Wang","affiliation":["Department of Information Science and Electronic Engineering, University of Zhejiang, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China"],"lastName":"Kuang Wang","id":"37087161745"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8225-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8224-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-8223-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5581870","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":145},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5581870","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Gold","Strontium"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["algebra","digital storage","power amplifiers","VLSI"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["algebraic predistorter","memory amplifier nonlinearity","high power amplifiers","normalized mean square error","computational complexity","memory unit requirement","VLSI structure","table storage limitation","filter algebraic solution","adaptive memory predistorters","spectral regrowth","polynomial method"]}],"abstract":"Baseband adaptive nonlinear predistorters are the most effective schemes in compensating the nonlinear effects of high power amplifiers in communication systems. The existing predistorters generally realized by the look-up table and polynomial methods. Although many well-considered algorithms based on the two methods have been proposed and implemented, their performances are restricted by either the table storage limitation or the increasing complexity burden of polynomial order. In this paper, we propose an algorithm using novel filter algebraic solution to construct the adaptive memory predistorters. Our proposed algorithm outperforms the existing polynomial predistorters and enjoys the comparable low complexity as LUT PDs. The simulation results confirm our point in terms of normalized mean square error and spectral re-growth. Furthermore, low computational complexity, small memory unit requirement can provide a simple VLSI structure implementation in the practical applications.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5581842","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCCAS.2010.5581870","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Communications, Circuits and Systems (ICCCAS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Communications, Circuits and Systems (ICCCAS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5570016/5581842/05581870.pdf","startPage":"800","endPage":"804","doi":"10.1109/ICCCAS.2010.5581870","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An efficient algebraic predistorter for compensating the nonlinearity of memory amplifiers","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 July 2010","displayDocTitle":"An efficient algebraic predistorter for compensating the nonlinearity of memory amplifiers","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"28-30 July 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5581870/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2010","accessionNumber":"11555603","dateOfInsertion":"23 September 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5581870/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An efficient algebraic predistorter for compensating the nonlinearity of memory amplifiers","confLoc":"Chengdu","sourcePdf":"081002800804.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064184S","chronDate":"28-30 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5570016","isNumber":"5581842","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5570016","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5581842","articleId":"5581870","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":5581900,"authors":[{"name":"Yilong Lu","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"lastName":"Yilong Lu","id":"37280557500"},{"name":"Dawei Cui","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"lastName":"Dawei Cui","id":"38196781300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8225-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8224-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-8223-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5581900","dbTime":"33 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":170},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5581900","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Switches","Educational institutions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna phased arrays","array signal processing","radio receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital beamforming","microwave digital receiver","chirp signals","N-element phased array","microwave switch","signal selection","DBF"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICCCAS.2010.5581900","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Communications, Circuits and Systems (ICCCAS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Communications, Circuits and Systems (ICCCAS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5570016/5581842/05581900.pdf","startPage":"731","endPage":"734","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCCAS.2010.5581900","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5581842","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel digital beamforming approach with single microwave digital receiver","abstract":"This paper proposes a novel low-cost array digital beamforming (DBF) concept by using only a single microwave digital receiver and chirp signals. The proposed system uses a microwave switch to select echo signals from an N-element phased array so that the number of required microwave digital receivers is reduced from N to one for considerable cost reduction. Typical low-cost DBF systems have severe constraints on the switching speed of diode signal switch and the computation power of the signal processor. Taking these constraints into consideration, the authors have developed two signal selection schemes that optimize the beamforming resolution. Simulation results suggest that the performance of the proposed system under designated application scenarios is comparable to more expensive conventional DBF systems.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 July 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5581900/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"11555611","publicationDate":"July 2010","conferenceDate":"28-30 July 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5581900/","dateOfInsertion":"23 September 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A novel digital beamforming approach with single microwave digital receiver","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel digital beamforming approach with single microwave digital receiver","confLoc":"Chengdu, China","sourcePdf":"070802731734.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.037768S","chronDate":"28-30 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5570016","isNumber":"5581842","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5570016","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5581842","articleId":"5581900","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":5581917,"authors":[{"name":"Li Qiang","affiliation":["College of Marine, Marine Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an, Shanxi, China"],"lastName":"Li Qiang","id":"37956159100"},{"name":"Chen Hang","affiliation":["College of Marine, Marine Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an, Shanxi, China"],"lastName":"Chen Hang","id":"38194658100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8225-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8224-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-8223-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5581917","dbTime":"18 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":96},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Artificial intelligence","Finite element methods","Scattering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electromagnetic wave scattering","mesh generation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["calculation adaptive mesh generation","FEM","electromagnetic scattering","automatic generation","finite element meshes","grid-based algorithm"]}],"abstract":"A new algorithm for the automatic generation of finite element meshes is presented, the method is based on an extension of the grid-based algorithm.

To generate pseudo random (PR) sequences for spread spectrum communications and improve its statistical properties, this paper introduces a novel switched chaotic system, which consists of four different subsystems and can change its structure timely and randomly from one to another using two switching functions. Using the switched system, a PR sequence generator is designed and realized based on FPGA (field programmable gate array). This technique is derived from the idea of combining DSP Builder tool with Matlab/Simulink and Quartus II software, and guarantees the generation of repeatable consistent sequences based only on the initial conditions. Furthermore, the proposed PR sequence generator is subjected to four basic statistical tests using the well-known tests suites FIPS-140-1. This PR sequence generator successfully passes all basic statistical tests and can be used in the design of various FPGA-based spread spectrum communications.","doi":"10.1109/ICCCAS.2010.5581965","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Communications, Circuits and Systems (ICCCAS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Communications, Circuits and Systems (ICCCAS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5570016/5581842/05581965.pdf","startPage":"417","endPage":"420","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5581842","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCCAS.2010.5581965","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design and FPGA realization of a pseudo random sequence generator based on a switched chaos","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5581965/","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 July 2010","displayDocTitle":"Design and FPGA realization of a pseudo random sequence generator based on a switched chaos","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5581965/","dateOfInsertion":"23 September 2010","publicationDate":"July 2010","accessionNumber":"11555530","conferenceDate":"28-30 July 2010","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design and FPGA realization of a pseudo random sequence generator based on a switched chaos","confLoc":"Chengdu, China","sourcePdf":"040901417420.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074808S","chronDate":"28-30 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5570016","isNumber":"5581842","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5570016","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5581842","articleId":"5581965","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":5581971,"authors":[{"name":"Qian Wang","affiliation":["Institute of Astronautics & Aeronautics, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, PRC"],"lastName":"Qian Wang","id":"37632940600"},{"name":"Xiao Yan","affiliation":["School of Automation Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, PRC"],"lastName":"Xiao Yan","id":"37631041300"},{"name":"Kaiyu Qin","affiliation":["Institute of Astronautics & Aeronautics, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, PRC"],"lastName":"Kaiyu Qin","id":"37628712300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8225-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8224-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-8223-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5581971","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":320},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Algorithm design and analysis","Real time systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["maximum likelihood estimation","quadrature phase shift keying","signal sampling","synchronisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["joint timing synchronization algorithm","OQPSK","real time multidomain measurement","real time multidomain signal analysis","offset quadrature phase shift keying communication","ratio resampling algorithm","polyphase filtering","feedforward joint phase","timing estimation algorithm","maximum likelihood argument","carrier phase offset","timing error"]}],"abstract":"Based on real-time multi-domain signal analysis architecture for wideband Offset Quadrature Phase Shift Keying (OQPSK) communication, a novel high-precision joint timing synchronization algorithm for OQPSK real-time multi-domain analysis and specifications measurement is presented. The proposed two-step algorithm first adjusts the sample rate of input measured OQPSK signal to integer multiple of the symbol rate by the arbitrary ratio resampling algorithm based on polyphase filtering. Then, the feedforward joint phase and timing estimation algorithm for OQPSK, which is derived using maximum-likelihood (ML) arguments, is applied to remove the carrier phase offset and timing error simultaneously.

How to allocate rates in order to maximize the system utility is an NP problem, which involves the joint optimization of rate allocation at the link layer and decoding order adjustment at the physical layer, and thus the cross-layer rate allocation should be considered. This paper proposes an efficient cross-layer rate allocation algorithm for addressing this NP problem. The proposed algorithm can be decomposed into two layers: the inner layer examining method to adjust the decoding order and quickly examine the feasibility of rate modes; the outer layer updating scheme to efficiently update rate modes based on the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. We conduct extensive simulation experiments, and the numerical results show that our proposed algorithm outperforms the existing algorithms based on the greedy algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/ICCCAS.2010.5582025","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Communications, Circuits and Systems (ICCCAS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Communications, Circuits and Systems (ICCCAS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5570016/5581842/05582025.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCCAS.2010.5582025","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5581842","startPage":"158","endPage":"162","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cross-layer rate allocation in CDMA systems with imperfect successive interference cancellation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5582025","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Cross-layer rate allocation in CDMA systems with imperfect successive interference cancellation","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 July 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5582025/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"28-30 July 2010","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2010","accessionNumber":"11555591","dateOfInsertion":"23 September 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5582025/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cross-layer rate allocation in CDMA systems with imperfect successive interference cancellation","confLoc":"Chengdu, China","sourcePdf":"010803158162.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049843S","chronDate":"28-30 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5570016","isNumber":"5581842","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5570016","xplore-issue":"5581842","articleId":"5582025","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5582027,"authors":[{"name":"Rui Yin","affiliation":["Institute of Information and Communication Engineering, University of Zhejiang, Hangzhou, China"],"lastName":"Rui Yin","id":"37407958600"},{"name":"Yu Zhang","affiliation":["Institute of Information and Communication Engineering, University of Zhejiang, Hangzhou, China"],"lastName":"Yu Zhang","id":"37292452900"},{"name":"Jietao Zhang","affiliation":["Wireless Research Department, Huawei Technologies Company Limited, Shenzhen, China"],"lastName":"Jietao Zhang","id":"37407608100"},{"name":"Guanding Yu","affiliation":["Institute of Information and Communication Engineering, University of Zhejiang, Hangzhou, China"],"lastName":"Guanding Yu","id":"37288513300"},{"name":"Zhaoyang Zhang","affiliation":["Institute of Information and Communication Engineering, University of Zhejiang, Hangzhou, China"],"lastName":"Zhaoyang Zhang","id":"37279636300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8225-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8224-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-8223-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5582027","dbTime":"24 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":102},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","OFDM modulation","optimisation","resource allocation","telecommunication network routing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["OFDMA-based relay system","optimal joint resource allocation","multiple orthogonal channels","multiple user system","single regenerative relay node","deterministic optimization","power constraint","Lagrange dual method","deterministic optimal programming","computational complexity"]}],"abstract":"Three issues should be taken into account to improve performance in relay system with multiple channels.

Simulation results show that proposed scheme enhances the throughputs performance in overall network, especially for the macrocell users and cell edge users.","doi":"10.1109/ICCCAS.2010.5582043","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Communications, Circuits and Systems (ICCCAS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Communications, Circuits and Systems (ICCCAS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5570016/5581842/05582043.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCCAS.2010.5582043","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5581842","startPage":"176","endPage":"180","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Interference management in OFDMA Femtocell systems using Fractional Frequency Reuse","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5582043","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Interference management in OFDMA Femtocell systems using Fractional Frequency Reuse","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 July 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5582043/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"28-30 July 2010","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2010","accessionNumber":"11555680","dateOfInsertion":"23 September 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5582043/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Interference management in OFDMA Femtocell systems using Fractional Frequency Reuse","confLoc":"Chengdu, China","sourcePdf":"010304176180.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066587S","chronDate":"28-30 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5570016","isNumber":"5581842","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5570016","citationCount":"34","xplore-issue":"5581842","articleId":"5582043","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5582046,"authors":[{"name":"Zhaorong Zhou","affiliation":["School of Physics and Electronic Engineering, Sichuan Normal University, Chengdu, Sichuan, China"],"firstName":"Zhaorong","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37278616300"},{"name":"Zhongrong Wang","affiliation":["School of Electronic Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology, Chengdu, China"],"lastName":"Zhongrong Wang","id":"38195277900"},{"name":"Yide Zhang","affiliation":["National Laboratory of Communications, University of Electronic Science and Technology, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Yide","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37279964000"},{"name":"Lemin Li","affiliation":["School of Communication and Information Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology, Chengdu, China"],"lastName":"Lemin Li","id":"37280693400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8225-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8224-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-8223-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5582046","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":64},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Mobile communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","interference suppression","telecommunication control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["grade of service based admission control","power constrained CDMA systems","successive interference cancellation","multiple access interference","mobile users","base station","AC policy"]}],"abstract":"In CDMA systems, although the technique of successive interference cancellation (SIC) can help to reduce multiple access interference (MAI) and increase system capacity, radio resources are still scarce due to the rapid increment of mobile users and the high requirements of communication services. Therefore, the policy of admission control (AC) needs to be carefully studied in CDMA systems with SIC. Moreover, multiple factors such as the differentiated services provided for different classes of users, single user power constraint, total received power constraint at the base station (BS) and decoding order have heavy impact on the system performance, and thus should be considered during designing the AC policy. In this paper, we study the AC policy in CDMA systems with SIC and propose an AC algorithm based on grade of service (GoS) to set the admission threshold under both constraints of the single user's power and total received power at the BS. In addition, the decoding order adjustment with the power constraint is taken into account in the proposed algorithm. As a result, our proposed AC algorithm benefits to improve the overall system performance.","doi":"10.1109/ICCCAS.2010.5582046","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Communications, Circuits and Systems (ICCCAS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Communications, Circuits and Systems (ICCCAS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5570016/5581842/05582046.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCCAS.2010.5582046","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5581842","startPage":"168","endPage":"172","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"GoS based admission control in power constrained CDMA systems with successive interference cancellation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5582046","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"GoS based admission control in power constrained CDMA systems with successive interference cancellation","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 July 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5582046/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"28-30 July 2010","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2010","accessionNumber":"11555639","dateOfInsertion":"23 September 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5582046/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"GoS based admission control in power constrained CDMA systems with successive interference cancellation","confLoc":"Chengdu, China","sourcePdf":"010303168172.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050074S","chronDate":"28-30 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5570016","isNumber":"5581842","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5570016","xplore-issue":"5581842","articleId":"5582046","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5582048,"authors":[{"name":"Lei Zhang","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Universal Wireless Communications, Ministry of Education, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Lei","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37068684700"},{"name":"Fei Liu","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Universal Wireless Communications, Ministry of Education, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Fei","lastName":"Liu","id":"38529306000"},{"name":"Lin Huang","affiliation":["Orange Laboratories-France Telecom Research and Development, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Lin","lastName":"Huang","id":"37280053100"},{"name":"Wenbo Wang","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Universal Wireless Communications, Ministry of Education, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Wenbo","lastName":"Wang","id":"37280459100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8225-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8224-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-8223-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5582048","dbTime":"22 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":21,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":1415},"abstract":"In the further advancements for the third generation (3G) long-term evolution (LTE) system, i.e. the LTE-Advanced system, carrier aggregation (CA) is applied to support wide system bandwidth and ensure backward compatibility. In this paper, two traffic load balance methods are proposed to improve the performance of the independent carrier scheduling (ICS) scheme in CA based LTE-Advanced system with time-variant user population. One is to utilize advanced user allocation rules. The other is a novel method which couples the component carriers (CCs) together in the scenario that the CCs are in the different working states. Our simulation results show that well-designed user allocation rules can achieve better traffic load balance across the CCs than the simplest random allocation rule. Moreover, the CC coupling method can make the ICS scheme achieve optimal performance as the joint carrier scheduling (JCS) scheme, irrespective of the traffic intensity and the used user allocation rule. However, using better user allocation rule can reduce the CC coupling time for the ICS scheme, which is essential to the practicality of ICS.","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Communications, Circuits and Systems (ICCCAS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5570016/5581842/05582048.pdf","startPage":"63","endPage":"67","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Communications, Circuits and Systems (ICCCAS)","doi":"10.1109/ICCCAS.2010.5582048","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCCAS.2010.5582048","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5581842","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5582048","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Traffic load balance methods in the LTE-Advanced system with carrier aggregation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resource management","Couplings","Load modeling","Integrated circuit modeling","Bandwidth","Joints","Wireless communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3G mobile communication","resource allocation","scheduling","telecommunication traffic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["LTE-advanced system","traffic load balance methods","carrier aggregation","3G long term evolution","independent carrier scheduling","component carriers","joint carrier scheduling","user allocation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5582048/","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 July 2010","displayDocTitle":"Traffic load balance methods in the LTE-Advanced system with carrier aggregation","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5582048/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2010","accessionNumber":"11555641","dateOfInsertion":"23 September 2010","conferenceDate":"28-30 July 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Traffic load balance methods in the LTE-Advanced system with carrier aggregation","confLoc":"Chengdu, China","sourcePdf":"0103016367.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05597S","chronDate":"28-30 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5570016","isNumber":"5581842","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5570016","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"5581842","articleId":"5582048","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5582049,"authors":[{"name":"Jun Zhang","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory of Science and Technology on Commmunications, UESTC, China"],"lastName":"Jun Zhang","id":"37085933048"},{"name":"Zhongpei Zhang","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory of Science and Technology on Commmunications, UESTC, Chengdu, China"],"lastName":"Zhongpei Zhang","id":"37279637700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8225-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8224-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-8223-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5582049","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2156},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","Demodulation","Phase shift keying","Baseband","Estimation","Synchronization","Rayleigh channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adjacent channel interference","channel estimation","fading channels","mobile communication","OFDM modulation","synchronisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["OFDM system","Simulink","frequency selected fading","inter-channel interference","mobile communications","OFDM block diagram","channel estimation","synchronization"]}],"abstract":"The OFDM technology can conquer the frequency selected fading and the inter-channel interference (ICI) effectively, so it is the core technology in the future mobile communications.

We further provide an analytical comparison between CI/OFDM and traditional OFDM. According to our analysis, the BER and PAPR advantage of CI/OFDM over the traditional OFDM are at the cost of low capacity. Moreover, we argue that the more frequently the channel deep fades occur, the more significant the advantage of CI/OFDM over OFDM is.

An efficient algorithm is proposed for selecting a set of users to achieve a high sum rate capacity of the system. With the above algorithm, the sum rate capacity of MIMO-BCs in CR networks with average interference power constraints and transmit power constraints is derived. We formulate the capacity as a multi-constraint optimization problem and develop efficient algorithms to solve the problem in its equivalent form. Finally, numerical simulations are conducted to corroborate our theoretical results in Rayleigh fading environments.

In this paper, two frame structures with different PN sequence designs for transmit diversity are proposed. One scheme takes PN sequence and zero sequence as frame header alternatively, and the other scheme designs a pair of orthogonal PN sequence based on space-time technique. Based on the proposed schemes, the corresponding iterative channel estimation method is also addressed. Analysis and simulations show that the proposed scheme can achieve good channel estimation and greatly improve the system performance.","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Communications, Circuits and Systems (ICCCAS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5570016/5581842/05582059.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Communications, Circuits and Systems (ICCCAS)","doi":"10.1109/ICCCAS.2010.5582059","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCCAS.2010.5582059","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5581842","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5582059","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Novel transmit diversity schemes and iterative channel estimation for TDS-OFDM system","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","Transmitting antennas","Convolution","Bit error rate","OFDM","Discrete Fourier transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","diversity reception","OFDM modulation","radio receivers","radio transmitters","sequences"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["transmit diversity","iterative channel estimation","TDS-OFDM system","time domain synchronous orthogonal frequency division multiplex system","pseudo noise sequence","transmit antennas","channel impulse response"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5582059/","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 July 2010","displayDocTitle":"Novel transmit diversity schemes and iterative channel estimation for TDS-OFDM system","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5582059/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2010","accessionNumber":"11555684","dateOfInsertion":"23 September 2010","conferenceDate":"28-30 July 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Novel transmit diversity schemes and iterative channel estimation for TDS-OFDM system","confLoc":"Chengdu, China","sourcePdf":"01010115.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054488S","chronDate":"28-30 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5570016","isNumber":"5581842","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5570016","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5581842","articleId":"5582059","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5582062,"authors":[{"name":"Stefan Behnel","affiliation":["Senacor Technologies AG, Germany"],"bio":{"p":["Stefan Behnel is a senior software developer at Senacor Technologies AG in Germany and a freelance developer and consultant.

Despite the usefulness of semantic similarity measures in these applications, accurately measuring semantic similarity between two words (or entities) remains a challenging task. We propose an empirical method to estimate semantic similarity using page counts and text snippets retrieved from a web search engine for two words. Specifically, we define various word co-occurrence measures using page counts and integrate those with lexical patterns extracted from text snippets. To identify the numerous semantic relations that exist between two given words, we propose a novel pattern extraction algorithm and a pattern clustering algorithm. The optimal combination of page counts-based co-occurrence measures and lexical pattern clusters is learned using support vector machines. The proposed method outperforms various baselines and previously proposed web-based semantic similarity measures on three benchmark data sets showing a high correlation with human ratings. Moreover, the proposed method significantly improves the accuracy in a community mining task.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5582093/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 September 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2011","publicationDate":"July 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5582093/","dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2011","accessionNumber":"12302950","volume":"23","issue":"7","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A Web Search Engine-Based Approach to Measure Semantic Similarity between Words","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Web Search Engine-Based Approach to Measure Semantic Similarity between Words","sourcePdf":"ttk2011070977.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.113615S","chronDate":"July  2011","xplore-pub-id":"69","isNumber":"6048019","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"69","citationCount":"122","xplore-issue":"6048019","articleId":"5582093","onlineDate":"23 September 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5582100,"authors":[{"name":"Joey Wilson","affiliation":["Sensing and Processing Across Networks (SPAN) Laboratory, University of Utah, Salt Lake, UT, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7755/5733931/5582100/5582100-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Joey Wilson received the PhD degree from the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Utah, in 2010.

The method takes advantage of the motion-induced variance of received signal strength measurements made in a wireless peer-to-peer network. Using a multipath channel model, we show that the signal strength on a wireless link is largely dependent on the power contained in multipath components that travel through space containing moving objects. A statistical model relating variance to spatial locations of movement is presented and used as a framework for the estimation of a motion image. From the motion image, the Kalman filter is applied to recursively track the coordinates of a moving target. Experimental results for a 34-node through-wall imaging and tracking system over a 780 square foot area are presented.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/7755/5733931/05582100.pdf","startPage":"612","endPage":"621","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","doi":"10.1109/TMC.2010.175","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMC.2010.175","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5733931","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5582100","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"See-Through Walls: Motion Tracking Using Variance-Based Radio Tomography Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Tracking","Buildings","Tomography","Radar imaging","Reactive power","Kalman filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image motion analysis","Kalman filters","multipath channels","object tracking","radio networks","radiofrequency measurement","target tracking","tomography"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["see-through wall surveillance","motion tracking","variance-based radio tomography networks","motion-induced variance","received signal strength measurements","wireless peer-to-peer network","multipath channel model","motion image","Kalman filter"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Wireless networks","sensors","tracking","through-wall surveillance."]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5582100/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 September 2010","displayDocTitle":"See-Through Walls: Motion Tracking Using Variance-Based Radio Tomography Networks","volume":"10","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/5582100/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2011","accessionNumber":"11874729","dateOfInsertion":"17 March 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"See-Through Walls: Motion Tracking Using Variance-Based Radio Tomography Networks","sourcePdf":"ttm2011050612.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.055058S","chronDate":"May  2011","xplore-pub-id":"7755","isNumber":"5733931","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7755","citationCount":"307","xplore-issue":"5733931","articleId":"5582100","onlineDate":"23 September 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-28"},{"_id":5582103,"authors":[{"name":"Hagen Marien","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, ESAT-MICAS, Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Heverlee, Belgium"],"firstName":"Hagen","lastName":"Marien","id":"37402238600"},{"name":"Michiel S.

Despite many efforts in designing IP prefix hijack detection schemes, no existing design can satisfy all the critical requirements of a truly effective system: real-time, accurate, lightweight, easily and incrementally deployable, as well as robust in victim notification. In this paper, we present a novel approach that fulfills all these goals by monitoring network reachability from key external transit networks to one's own network through lightweight prefix-owner-based active probing. Using the prefix-owner's view of reachability, our detection system, iSPY, can differentiate between IP prefix hijacking and network failures based on the observation that hijacking is likely to result in topologically more diverse polluted networks and unreachability. Through detailed simulations of Internet routing, 25-day deployment in 88 autonomous systems (ASs) (108 prefixes), and experiments with hijacking events of our own prefix from multiple locations, we demonstrate that iSPY is accurate with false negative ratio below 0.45% and false positive ratio below 0.17%. Furthermore, iSPY is truly real-time; it can detect hijacking events within a few minutes.","doi":"10.1109/TNET.2010.2066284","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","pdfPath":"/iel5/90/5669974/05582115.pdf","startPage":"1815","endPage":"1828","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNET.2010.2066284","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5669974","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"iSPY: Detecting IP Prefix Hijacking on My Own","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5582115","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 September 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5582115/","displayDocTitle":"iSPY: Detecting IP Prefix Hijacking on My Own","volume":"18","issue":"6","publicationDate":"Dec. 2010","accessionNumber":"11704171","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5582115/","dateOfInsertion":"17 December 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"iSPY: Detecting IP Prefix Hijacking on My Own","sourcePdf":"tnet-hu-2066284-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.100394S","chronDate":"Dec.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"90","isNumber":"5669974","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"90","citationCount":"41","xplore-issue":"5669974","articleId":"5582115","onlineDate":"23 September 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5582117,"authors":[{"name":"P.

However, these schemes are very prone to nonlinear distortion effects and have high carrier synchronization requirements. SC-FDE (Single-Carrier with Frequency-Domain Equalization) is an attractive alternative for OFDM, especially when an efficient power amplification is intended. In this paper we consider the use of SC-FDE schemes combined with non-uniform hierarchical constellations in broadband broadcast and multicast wireless systems. We study the impact of residual CFO (Carrier Frequency Offset) on the performance of multi-resolution schemes and we propose iterative frequency domain receivers with joint detection and carrier synchronization to cope with residual CFO estimation errors (a coarse CFO estimation and compensation is assumed before the equalization procedure). Our results show that while a very high carrier synchronization accuracy is required for the least protected bits, the most protected bits are relatively robust to the CFO. By employing the proposed receiver we increase significantly the robustness to residual CFO estimation errors.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting","pdfPath":"/iel5/11/5623279/05582117.pdf","startPage":"551","endPage":"557","doi":"10.1109/TBC.2010.2073251","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBC.2010.2073251","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5623279","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Iterative Frequency Domain Equalization and Carrier Synchronization for Multi-Resolution Constellations","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5582117/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 September 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2010","displayDocTitle":"Iterative Frequency Domain Equalization and Carrier Synchronization for Multi-Resolution Constellations","htmlLink":"/document/5582117/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2010","accessionNumber":"11655182","isJournal":true,"volume":"56","issue":"4","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Iterative Frequency Domain Equalization and Carrier Synchronization for Multi-Resolution Constellations","sourcePdf":"tbc-pedrosa-2073251-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.070417S","chronDate":"Dec.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"11","isNumber":"5623279","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"11","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"5623279","articleId":"5582117","onlineDate":"23 September 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":5582124,"authors":[{"name":"Ravi P.

SPH is a Lagrangian particle method typically used to model compressible and quasi-incompressible fluid flows. In this study, SPH is used to develop a decentralized controller for a swarm of fixed-wing UAVs, which move in 3-D space under constraints of airspeed and turning radius. Vector field path-following is used to guide the swarm towards the goal. We investigate circular, racetrack and counter-rotating loiter patterns for the UAVs in the goal region. This fluid dynamics coordination treatment allows UAVs to avoid collisions with obstacles and other flying UAVs. 3-D simulations are used to test the SPH-based control algorithm. Simulations were used to explore special cases, such as the modeling of obstacles with virtual SPH particles, and the use of a variable kernel to control the inter-vehicle separation. Finally, an aerial mobile sensor network is set up using SPH as the control mechanism, and an experimental characterization of air-to-air and air-to-ground communications is conducted. The experiments use two ground stations and three Delta-wing UAVs with a wingspan of 32 inches as nodes. Each node has a IEEE 802.15.4 ZigBee radio operating in the 2.4 GHz band. The low computational costs involved in the distributed SPH-based control algorithm make it an attractive option for implementation on simple inexpensive microprocessors. The results of simulations and experiments demonstrate the viability of setting up a mobile sensor network of inexpensive UAVs based on SPH.","doi":"10.1109/JSEN.2010.2064294","publicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","pdfPath":"/iel5/7361/5697312/05582157.pdf","startPage":"722","endPage":"736","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSEN.2010.2064294","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5697312","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Fluid Dynamic Based Coordination of a Wireless Sensor Network of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles: 3-D Simulation and Wireless Communication Characterization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 September 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5582157/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2011","displayDocTitle":"A Fluid Dynamic Based Coordination of a Wireless Sensor Network of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles: 3-D Simulation and Wireless Communication Characterization","dateOfInsertion":"24 January 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5582157/","accessionNumber":"11792298","volume":"11","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Fluid Dynamic Based Coordination of a Wireless Sensor Network of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles: 3-D Simulation and Wireless Communication Characterization","sourcePdf":"jsen-mohseni-2064294-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.063087S","chronDate":"March  2011","xplore-pub-id":"7361","isNumber":"5697312","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7361","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"5697312","articleId":"5582157","onlineDate":"23 September 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5582158,"authors":[{"name":"Muaz A.

Position estimates of an individual fluorescent particle are generated from fluorescence intensity measurements taken at a small number of discrete locations. Tracking is achieved by combining the estimation procedure with a linear quadratic Gaussian (LQG) regulator. Multiple particles are tracked by combining the models for individual particles into a single system, applying the same LQG framework, and then cycling the control through each subsystem in turn. Experimental results are presented for single and multiple particles. For validation purposes, during each experiment images from a charge-coupled device camera were captured and analyzed offline using a standard Gaussian fit method. The estimated trajectories were in good agreement with those produced by the LQG algorithm, thereby verifying the tracking scheme.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5582168/","volume":"19","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/5582168/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12205985","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"15 August 2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 September 2010","displayDocTitle":"Tracking Nanometer-Scale Fluorescent Particles in Two Dimensions With a Confocal Microscope","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Tracking Nanometer-Scale Fluorescent Particles in Two Dimensions With a Confocal Microscope","sourcePdf":"tcst-andersson-2067449-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.147286S","chronDate":"Sept.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"87","isNumber":"5983465","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"87","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"5983465","articleId":"5582168","onlineDate":"23 September 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5582172,"authors":[{"name":"Yiming Shen","affiliation":["Advanced Photonic Systems Laboratory, Concordia University, Montreal, QUE, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/5629952/5582172/5582172-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yiming Shen received the Bachelor's degree in telecommunication engineering from Huazhong Normal University, Wuhan, China, in 2006, and is currently working toward the Master degree in electrical and computer engineering at Concordia University, Montr\u00e9al, QC, Canada.","From 2005 to 2006, he was an RF Power Amplifier Engineer with the Wuhan Gewei Electronic Corporation.

In this novel predistortion circuit, neither amplifiers, nor phase shifters are used, while only two antiparallel connected diodes are used, and the predistortion signal is adjusted by tuning the diodes' dc-bias current. The simple architecture makes the circuit cost effective and suitable for UWB system applications. By adding the predistortion circuit before the EAM, more than 7-dB suppression in third-order intermodulation distortion and 11-dB improvement in spurious-free dynamic range are achieved over the frequency range of 3.1-4.8 GHz, i.e., bandgroup 1 of MB-OFDM UWB. Correspondingly, 1-dB improvement in error vector magnitude is obtained experimentally when the designed predistortion circuit is used.","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.2010.2074530","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel5/22/5629952/05582172.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.2010.2074530","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5629952","startPage":"3327","endPage":"3335","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Novel Analog Broadband RF Predistortion Circuit to Linearize Electro-Absorption Modulators in Multiband OFDM Radio-Over-Fiber Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5582172","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Novel Analog Broadband RF Predistortion Circuit to Linearize Electro-Absorption Modulators in Multiband OFDM Radio-Over-Fiber Systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5582172/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 September 2010","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"58","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 2010","accessionNumber":"11638649","dateOfInsertion":"11 November 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5582172/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel Analog Broadband RF Predistortion Circuit to Linearize Electro-Absorption Modulators in Multiband OFDM Radio-Over-Fiber Systems","sourcePdf":"tmtt-zhang-2074530-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.097547S","chronDate":"Nov.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"5629952","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"45","xplore-issue":"5629952","articleId":"5582172","onlineDate":"23 September 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5582186,"authors":[{"name":"Hongzhi Sun","affiliation":["University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, US"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7361/5708787/5582186/5582186-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Hongzhi Sun (S'07) received the B.S. degree in materials science and engineering from Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China, in 2005 and the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from the University of Florida, Gainesville, in 2008, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering.","His research interest is the interface design for complementary metal\u2013oxide-semiconductor\u2013microelectromechanical-system inertial sensors.","Mr. Sun is a member of Eta Kappa Nu."]},"firstName":"Hongzhi","lastName":"Sun","id":"37596247700"},{"name":"Deyou Fang","affiliation":["Freescale Semicond., Tempe, AZ, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7361/5708787/5582186/5582186-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Deyou Fang received the B.E. degree in automation control from the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China, in 1993, and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical and computer engineering from the University of Florida, Gainesville, in 2003 and 2006, respectively.","From 1993 to 1996, he worked on the design and development of power station control systems.

Although correlation-based detection methods potentially provide needed per-node performance improvements for correlated signals, their performance for realistic blind sensing is unclear since the type and extent of correlation may be unknown in practice. Although standard Neymon-Pearson (NP) based detection can be applied when correlation is perfectly known, difficulty arises when the correlation is random, which is the focus of this paper. A tighter bound for the performance of correlation-based methods is developed herein based on a signal with random correlation and NP detection under the assumption of correlation distribution information (CDI). Simulations of existing ad-hoc correlation-based detectors are compared to the upperbound using a simple uniform random correlation model (RCM). Additionally, a measurement campaign is presented where radio-frequency (RF) spectra in many bands of interest are measured throughout a large sub-urban environment, generating realistic models for the random signal correlation. The measurement-based model indicates limits on performance gains possible with correlation-based detection and how well existing ad-hoc techniques can be expected to perform in practice.","doi":"10.1109/JSEN.2010.2058097","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","pdfPath":"/iel5/7361/5697312/05582188.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5697312","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSEN.2010.2058097","publicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","startPage":"657","endPage":"666","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Correlation-Based Sensing for Cognitive Radio Networks: Bounds and Experimental Assessment","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5582188","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 September 2010","displayDocTitle":"Correlation-Based Sensing for Cognitive Radio Networks: Bounds and Experimental Assessment","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5582188/","volume":"11","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/5582188/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2011","accessionNumber":"11792299","dateOfInsertion":"24 January 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Correlation-Based Sensing for Cognitive Radio Networks: Bounds and Experimental Assessment","sourcePdf":"jsen-wallace-2058097-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073653S","chronDate":"March  2011","xplore-pub-id":"7361","isNumber":"5697312","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7361","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"5697312","articleId":"5582188","onlineDate":"23 September 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5582195,"authors":[{"name":"Ki-Dong Lee","affiliation":["LG Electronics Mobile Research, San Diego, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/5629319/5582195/5582195-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ki-Dong Lee (S'00-A'01-M'04-SM'07) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in operation research and the Ph.D. degree in industrial engineering (with applications to wireless networks) from the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), Daejeon, Korea.

However, when doing so the policy may not be utility-optimal. This causes users to decrease their consumption, which leads to a decrease of profit for service providers. Therefore, a service provider should choose a Pareto-efficient resource allocation policy so that both the profit of the service provider and the utility of the users can be optimally balanced. In this paper, we develop a framework for finding the necessary and sufficient condition for Pareto-efficiency, derive the Pareto-efficient resource allocation policies and propose an efficient solution for achieving it in Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing systems.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/5629319/05582195.pdf","startPage":"3277","endPage":"3285","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2010.091310.0900102","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2010.091310.0900102","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5629319","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5582195","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On Pareto-Efficiency Between Profit and Utility in OFDM Resource Allocation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resource management","Throughput","OFDM","Wireless communication","Consumer electronics","Frequency conversion","Mobile communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["OFDM modulation","Pareto analysis","resource allocation","wireless mesh networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Pareto efficiency","OFDM resource allocation","broadband wireless services"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Wireless multi-class service","resource allocation","Pareto efficiency","profit","utility"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5582195/","chronOrPublicationDate":"November  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 September 2010","displayDocTitle":"On Pareto-Efficiency Between Profit and Utility in OFDM Resource Allocation","volume":"58","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/5582195/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"November 2010","accessionNumber":"11638711","dateOfInsertion":"11 November 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On Pareto-Efficiency Between Profit and Utility in OFDM Resource Allocation","sourcePdf":"3277-tc1011-lee.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.061975S","chronDate":"November  2010","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"5629319","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"5629319","articleId":"5582195","onlineDate":"23 September 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":5582209,"authors":[{"name":"J\u00fcrgen Seiler","affiliation":["Multimedia Communications and Signal Processing, University of Erlangen Nuremberg, Erlangen, Germany"],"firstName":"J\u00fcrgen","lastName":"Seiler","id":"37569803900"},{"name":"Andr\u00e9 Kaup","affiliation":["Multimedia Communications and Signal Processing, University of Erlangen Nuremberg, Erlangen, Germany"],"firstName":"Andr\u00e9","lastName":"Kaup","id":"37285096200"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1070-9908"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2361"}],"articleNumber":"5582209","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":45,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":1226},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Extrapolation","Signal processing algorithms","Computational modeling","Frequency domain analysis","Computational complexity","Discrete Fourier transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["extrapolation","Fourier analysis","frequency selective surfaces","video signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["complex-valued frequency selective extrapolation","image signal extrapolation","video signal extrapolation","video signal processing","image signal processing","Fourier basis functions"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Image and video communication","signal extrapolation"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5582209","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Complex-Valued Frequency Selective Extrapolation for Fast Image and Video Signal Extrapolation","doi":"10.1109/LSP.2010.2078504","startPage":"949","endPage":"952","publicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/97/5559660/05582209.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5559660","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LSP.2010.2078504","abstract":"Signal extrapolation tasks arise in miscellaneous manners in the field of image and video signal processing. But, due to the widespread use of low-power and mobile devices, the computational complexity of an algorithm plays a crucial role in selecting an algorithm for a given problem. Within the scope of this contribution, we introduce the complex-valued Frequency Selective Extrapolation for fast image and video signal extrapolation. This algorithm iteratively generates a generic complex-valued model of the signal to be extrapolated as weighted superposition of Fourier basis functions. We further show that this algorithm is up to 10 times faster than the existent real-valued Frequency Selective Extrapolation that takes the real-valued nature of the input signals into account during the model generation. At the same time, the quality which is achievable by the complex-valued model generation is similar to the quality of the real-valued model generation.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5582209/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 September 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2010","volume":"17","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"04 October 2010","accessionNumber":"11560857","publicationDate":"Nov. 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5582209/","isStaticHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Complex-Valued Frequency Selective Extrapolation for Fast Image and Video Signal Extrapolation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Complex-Valued Frequency Selective Extrapolation for Fast Image and Video Signal Extrapolation","sourcePdf":"lsp-seiler-2078504-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.040929S","chronDate":"Nov.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"97","isNumber":"5559660","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"97","citationCount":"45","xplore-issue":"5559660","articleId":"5582209","onlineDate":"23 September 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-16"},{"_id":5582213,"authors":[{"name":"Jason Zheng Jiang","affiliation":["Department of Engineering, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/9/5784391/5582213/5582213-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jason Zheng Jiang (M\u201310) received the B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees in electrical and electronic engineering from Shanghai Jiaotong University, Shanghai, China, in 2003 and 2006 respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in the Control Group, Department of Engineering, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, U.K., in 2010.","His research focuses on passive mechanical control, suspension systems, and network synthesis theory.

Moreover, there are two such network quartets which can realize all regular biquadratics. It is shown that the only five-element networks which can realize nonregular biquadratics can be arranged into three network quartets. The quartets comprise: 1) two bridge networks with two reactive elements; 2) four series-parallel networks with three reactive elements; and 3) two bridge networks with three reactive elements. The necessary and sufficient realizability conditions are derived for each of these networks.

A multi-stage design procedure is also proposed for the design and synthesis of this class of frequency selective surfaces. The design procedure is based on synthesizing the desired device from its equivalent circuit parameter values. An approximate analytical technique is provided, which can be used to determine the values of the equivalent circuit parameters of this dual-band device from the basic system level characteristics of its transfer function including the center frequencies of operations of its two bands of operation and the bandwidth at each of these bands. The use of this design procedure is described in detail by a design example which follows the proposed design procedure step by step; the validity of the procedure is verified using full-wave EM simulations and experimental characterization of a fabricated prototype of the proposed device. Experimental characterizations of this device show that it has a stable frequency response as a function of angle of incidence for both the transverse electric (TE) and the transverse magnetic (TM) polarizations. This stability is attributed to the extremely small overall thickness of the structure as well as its small unit cell dimensions.","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2010.2078478","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8/5639211/05582217.pdf","startPage":"4042","endPage":"4050","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5639211","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2010.2078478","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 September 2010","displayDocTitle":"Low-Profile, Highly-Selective, Dual-Band Frequency Selective Surfaces With Closely Spaced Bands of Operation","volume":"58","issue":"12","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5582217/","dateOfInsertion":"03 December 2010","publicationDate":"Dec. 2010","accessionNumber":"11684739","isJournal":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5582217/","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low-Profile, Highly-Selective, Dual-Band Frequency Selective Surfaces With Closely Spaced Bands of Operation","sourcePdf":"tap-behdad-2078478-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.066454S","chronDate":"Dec.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"5639211","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"80","xplore-issue":"5639211","articleId":"5582217","onlineDate":"23 September 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-19"},{"_id":5582218,"authors":[{"name":"Paolo Burghignoli","affiliation":["Information Engineering, Electronics and Telecommunications, University of Roma La Sapienza, Rome, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8/5639211/5582218/5582218-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Paolo Burghignoli (S'97\u2013M'01\u2013SM'08) was born in Rome, Italy, on February 18, 1973.

Azimuthally omnidirectional radiation is shown to be produced, in the form of very directive pencil beams pointing at broadside or of conical scanned beams, with excellent polarization purity. An approximate homogenized model of the antenna based on a transverse-equivalent-network representation shows that the particular temporally and spatially dispersive equivalent susceptance of the MSG accounts for the observed peculiar radiation properties. Furthermore, it shows that the wavenumbers of the modes supported by the structure are independent of their direction of propagation, thus providing an explanation of the above-mentioned properties in terms of cylindrical leaky waves propagating omnidirectionally along the structure.

The design of these novel resonant-type antennas is based on the study of a composite right/left-handed (CRLH) substrate integrated waveguide (SIW) starting from the dispersion diagram and the equivalent circuit. These proposed CRLH resonators are realized by etching the interdigital slot on the surface of the SIW. The slot acts as a series capacitor as well as a radiator leading to a CRLH antenna application. Two types of slot antennas, which are open-ended and short-ended, respectively, are proposed and discussed. The short-ended antenna, which represents a quasi-quarter-wavelength resonator, is characterized by a cavity-backed slot antenna thus providing a high gain. On the other hand, the open-ended antenna exhibits a small size owing to a quasi-half-wavelength operation in the left-handed (LH) region. Four antennas with one or two unit cells are fabricated and measured. Compared with the existing CRLH patch antennas and waveguide slot antennas, our antennas show advantages in terms of simplicity, low-profile, high efficiency, easy fabrication and integration with other circuits.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Miniaturized Substrate Integrated Waveguide Slot Antennas Based on Negative Order Resonance","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2010.2078449","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8/5639211/05582221.pdf","startPage":"3856","endPage":"3864","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2010.2078449","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5639211","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5582221","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5582221/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 September 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2010","displayDocTitle":"Miniaturized Substrate Integrated Waveguide Slot Antennas Based on Negative Order Resonance","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"58","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/5582221/","dateOfInsertion":"03 December 2010","publicationDate":"Dec. 2010","accessionNumber":"11684747","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Miniaturized Substrate Integrated Waveguide Slot Antennas Based on Negative Order Resonance","sourcePdf":"tap-dong-2078449-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.141301S","chronDate":"Dec.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"5639211","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"116","xplore-issue":"5639211","articleId":"5582221","onlineDate":"23 September 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5582222,"authors":[{"name":"Stylianos Dosopoulos","affiliation":["Electroscience Laboratory Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Ohio State Uinversity, Columbus, OH, USA"],"firstName":"Stylianos","lastName":"Dosopoulos","id":"37302947300"},{"name":"Jin-Fa Lee","affiliation":["Electroscience Laboratory Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Ohio State Uinversity, Columbus, OH, USA"],"firstName":"Jin-Fa","lastName":"Lee","id":"37280305700"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-926X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2221"}],"articleNumber":"5582222","dbTime":"36 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":64,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":974},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society","url":"http://www.ieeeaps.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Numerical stability","Convergence","Approximation methods","Stability criteria","Maxwell equations","Time domain analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electromagnetic waves","finite element analysis","Galerkin method","Maxwell equations","time-domain analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["interior penalty discontinuous Galerkin finite element method","time-dependent first order Maxwell equations","conformal perfectly matched layer","time domain","local time-stepping strategy"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Conformal PML","discontinuous Galerkin (DG)","local time-stepping","Maxwell's equations","time-domain (TD)"]}],"abstract":"An interior penalty discontinuous Galerkin method is described with a conformal perfectly matched layer (PML) for solving the two first-order Maxwell's equations in the time domain.

Most existing region duplication detection methods are based on directly matching blocks of image pixels or transform coefficients, and are not effective when the duplicated regions have geometrical or illumination distortions. In this work, we describe a new region duplication detection method that is robust to distortions of the duplicated regions. Our method starts by estimating the transform between matched scale invariant feature transform (SIFT) keypoints, which are insensitive to geometrical and illumination distortions, and then finds all pixels within the duplicated regions after discounting the estimated transforms. The proposed method shows effective detection on an automatically synthesized forgery image database with duplicated and distorted regions. We further demonstrate its practical performance with several challenging forgery images created with state-of-the-art tools.","doi":"10.1109/TIFS.2010.2078506","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security","pdfPath":"/iel5/10206/5623286/05582232.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIFS.2010.2078506","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5623286","startPage":"857","endPage":"867","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Region Duplication Detection Using Image Feature Matching","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5582232","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Region Duplication Detection Using Image Feature Matching","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5582232/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 September 2010","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"5","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Dec. 2010","accessionNumber":"11641622","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5582232/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Region Duplication Detection Using Image Feature Matching","sourcePdf":"tifs-lyu-2078506-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.115079S","chronDate":"Dec.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"10206","isNumber":"5623286","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10206","citationCount":"254","xplore-issue":"5623286","articleId":"5582232","onlineDate":"23 September 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5582237,"authors":[{"name":"Nanbo Jin","affiliation":["Apple Computer, Inc., Cupertino, CA, USA","Department of Electrical Engineering, University of California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8/5639211/5582237/5582237-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Nanbo Jin (S'03-M'09) received the B.S. degree from Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, in 2003, and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees from University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), in 2005 and 2008, respectively, all in electrical engineering.","He has been with Apple Inc., Cupertino, CA, since 2008.

The axial geometry of the antenna is represented as a set of piecewise-linear lumped resistors. And the near fields around the antenna and the coaxial feed aperture are approximated to the quasi-static fields with the cylindrical behavior. From the cylindrical-to-Cartesian coordinate transformation of the quasi-static fields and the contour-path integration along FDTD unit cells in the vicinity of the antenna and its feed, the 3-D Cartesian FDTD equations are derived. These equations may correspond to a full coarse-grid FDTD approach with the equivalent corrections.

Conjugate symmetric beamforming weights are used so that the upper and non-convex lower bound constraints on the beampattern can be convex. Thus, a mainlobe of an arbitrary beamwidth and response ripple can be obtained. This method can achieve completely arbitrary sidelobe levels. By minimizing a re-weighted objective function based on the magnitudes of the elements in the beamforming weight vector iteratively, the proposed method selects certain antennas in an array to satisfy the prescribed beampattern specifications precisely. Interestingly, a sparse array with fewer antennas (compared to other methods) is produced. This method can design non-uniformly spaced arrays with inter-element spacings larger than one half-wavelength, without the appearance of grating lobes in the resulting beampattern.

A single-feed configuration based asymmetric-circular shaped slotted square microstrip patches are adopted to realize the compact circularly polarized microstrip antennas. The asymmetric-circular shaped slot(s) along the diagonal directions are embedded symmetrically onto a square microstrip patch for CP radiation and small antenna size. The CP radiation can be achieved by slightly asymmetric (unbalanced) patch along the diagonal directions by slot areas. Four symmetric-slits are also embedded symmetrically along the orthogonal directions of the asymmetric-circular shaped slotted patch to further reduce antenna size.

The complete design procedure is explained through a design example that exhibits a bandwidth of 113% while the absorber thickness is less than 10% of the free space wavelength at the lowest operating frequency.","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2010.2078452","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8/5639211/05582253.pdf","startPage":"3913","endPage":"3922","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2010.2078452","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5639211","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Wideband Microwave Absorber Based on a Two-Dimensional Periodic Array of Microstrip Lines","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5582253","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 September 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5582253/","displayDocTitle":"Wideband Microwave Absorber Based on a Two-Dimensional Periodic Array of Microstrip Lines","volume":"58","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 2010","accessionNumber":"11684769","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5582253/","dateOfInsertion":"03 December 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wideband Microwave Absorber Based on a Two-Dimensional Periodic Array of Microstrip Lines","sourcePdf":"tap-rashid-2078452-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.055261S","chronDate":"Dec.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"5639211","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"45","xplore-issue":"5639211","articleId":"5582253","onlineDate":"23 September 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5582258,"authors":[{"name":"Alvaro Valcarce","affiliation":["Centre of Wireless Network Design CWiND, Institute of Research on Applicable Computing IRAC, University of Bedfordshire, Luton, UK"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8/5639211/5582258/5582258-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Alvaro Valcarce (A'10) received the M.Eng. degree in telecommunications engineering from the University of Vigo (Spain), in 2006.","Between 2006 and 2007, he worked at the WiSAAR consortium in Saarbr\u00fccken (Germany), performing WiMAX field trials and analyzing radio coverage measurements.

WZVC exploits the statistics between the source frame and the SI frame at the decoder by utilizing their correlation information. This correlation information is important but also difficult to estimate due to the absence of the SI frame at the encoder, and the lack of the source frame at the decoder. In this paper, we focus on this problem and propose a novel transform-domain adaptive correlation estimation method called TRACE for WZVC. In TRACE, the correlation information is progressively learned during the decoding process of each frame. Within TRACE, we also propose a convex optimization based band-level correlation estimation method which is optimal in the sense of minimizing the theoretical bit rate. Experiments suggest that, when applied in motion compensated interpolation-based low complexity WZVC, TRACE yields competitive results against the state-of-the-art correlation estimation algorithms. More importantly, different from the existing coefficient-level correlation estimation algorithms, the proposed TRACE can be applied in many other WZVC schemes and can provide considerable gain over the popular band-level correlation estimation methods.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5582270/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 September 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2010","volume":"20","issue":"11","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11629525","dateOfInsertion":"04 November 2010","publicationDate":"Nov. 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5582270/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Transform-Domain Adaptive Correlation Estimation (TRACE) for Wyner\u2013Ziv Video Coding","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Transform-Domain Adaptive Correlation Estimation (TRACE) for Wyner\u2013Ziv Video Coding","sourcePdf":"tcsvt-fan-2077472-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.118775S","chronDate":"Nov.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"76","isNumber":"5621670","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"32","xplore-issue":"5621670","articleId":"5582270","onlineDate":"23 September 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":5582283,"authors":[{"name":"Francesc Aul\u00ec-Llin\u00e0s","affiliation":["Department of Information and Communications Engineering, Universitat Aut\u00f2noma de Barcelona, Spain"],"firstName":"Francesc","lastName":"Aul\u00ec-Llin\u00e0s","id":"38277741600"},{"name":"Ali Bilgin","affiliation":["Department of Biomedical Engineering and with the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ, USA"],"firstName":"Ali","lastName":"Bilgin","id":"37281700300"},{"name":"Michael W.

Thus, researchers have started looking at alternative switching devices and spintronics-based computing paradigms. Nanomagnet-based computing is one such paradigm with intrinsic switching energy close to thermal limits and scalability down to 5 nm. In this paper, we explore the possibility of nanomagnet-based design using nonmajority gates. The design approach can offer significant area, delay, and energy advantages compared to majority-gate-based designs. Moreover, new clock technologies and architectures are developed to improve computation robustness and power dissipation of nanomagnet systems. We also developed a comprehensive device/circuit/system compatible simulation framework to evaluate the functionality and architecture of a nanomagnet system and conducted a feasibility/comparison study to determine the effectiveness of the technology compared to standard digital electronics. Performance results from a nanomagnet-based 16-point discrete cosine transform (DCT) with enhanced clock architecture, narrow gap cladding of nanomagnets, or embedding nanomagnets in solenoid with steel core, together with near neighbor system architecture, show up to 10 \u00d7 improvement over subthreshold 15 nm CMOS (Vdd = 90 mV) design, using \u201cenergy-delay\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">0.5</sup>\n-area product (ED\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">0.5</sup>\n A)\u201d as comparison metric.

The neural network (NN), trained with five different flight flutter cases, is validated using 11 other flight flutter test (FFT) data. A total of 16 FFT cases were obtained for all three flight regimes (subsonic, transonic, and supersonic) at Mach numbers ranging between 0.85 and 1.30 and at altitudes of between 5000 and 25 000 ft. The results obtained highlight the efficiency of the multilayer perceptron NN in model identification. Optimization of the NN requires mixing of two proprieties: the hidden layer size reduction and four-layered NN performances. This paper shows that a four-layer NN with only 16 neurons is enough to create an accurate model. The fit coefficients were higher than 92% for both the identification and the validation test data, thus demonstrating accuracy of the NN.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5582299/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 September 2010","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11623356","pubMedId":"20875971","volume":"21","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/5582299/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"01 November 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"New Approach for the Identification and Validation of a Nonlinear F/A-18 Model by Use of Neural Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"New Approach for the Identification and Validation of a Nonlinear F/A-18 Model by Use of Neural Networks","sourcePdf":"tnn-botez-2071398-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.092827S","chronDate":"Nov.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"72","isNumber":"5617343","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"5617343","articleId":"5582299","onlineDate":"23 September 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":5582300,"authors":[{"name":"Rupert Ortner","affiliation":["Guger Technologies OEG, Schiedlberg, Austria"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7333/5710486/5582300/5582300-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Rupert Ortner received the M.S. degree in biomedical engineering from the Graz University of Technology, Graz, Austria, in 2008.

In this study, we demonstrate a BCI system for orthosis control. Our BCI was asynchronous, meaning that subjects could move the orthosis whenever they wanted, instead of pacing themselves to external cues. Seven subjects each performed two tasks with a BCI that relied on steady state visual evoked potentials (SSVEPs). Although none of the subjects had any training, six subjects showed good control with a positive predictive value (PPV) higher than 60%. The overall PPV for all subjects reached 78% \u00b110%. However, the false positive rate was high, and some subjects dislike the flickering lights required in SSVEP BCIs. In follow-up work, we hope to reduce both the false positive rate and the annoyance produced by flickering lights by hybridizing this BCI with a \u201cbrain switch,\u201d which could allow people to turn the SSVEP system on or off using a second type of brain activity when they do not wish to control the orthosis.

In this paper, we show that ISL can be very useful to improve the performance of population-based optimization algorithms. Our study focuses on two particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithms: a) the incremental particle swarm optimizer (IPSO), which is a PSO algorithm with a growing population size in which the initial position of new particles is biased toward the best-so-far solution, and b) the incremental particle swarm optimizer with local search (IPSOLS), in which solutions are further improved through a local search procedure. We first derive analytically the probability density function induced by the proposed initialization rule applied to new particles. Then, we compare the performance of IPSO and IPSOLS on a set of benchmark functions with that of other PSO algorithms (with and without local search) and a random restart local search algorithm. Finally, we measure the benefits of using incremental social learning on PSO algorithms by running IPSO and IPSOLS on problems with different fitness distance correlations.","doi":"10.1109/TSMCB.2010.2055848","pdfPath":"/iel5/3477/5730604/05582312.pdf","startPage":"368","endPage":"384","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSMCB.2010.2055848","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5730604","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Incremental Social Learning in Particle Swarms","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5582312/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 September 2010","displayDocTitle":"Incremental Social Learning in Particle Swarms","volume":"41","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"14 March 2011","accessionNumber":"11862720","pubMedId":"20875976","publicationDate":"April 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5582312/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Incremental Social Learning in Particle Swarms","sourcePdf":"tsmcb-montesdeoca-2055848-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.158144S","chronDate":"April  2011","xplore-pub-id":"3477","isNumber":"5730604","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3477","citationCount":"80","xplore-issue":"5730604","articleId":"5582312","onlineDate":"23 September 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":5582313,"authors":[{"name":"Chen Chen","affiliation":["School of Electronics Engineering and Computer Science, Peking University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Chen","lastName":"Chen","id":"37280736400"},{"name":"Lin Bai","affiliation":["School of Engineering, Swansea University, Swansea, UK"],"firstName":"Lin","lastName":"Bai","id":"37590586800"},{"name":"Bo Wu","affiliation":["School of Electronics Engineering and Computer Science, Peking University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Bo","lastName":"Wu","id":"37401207800"},{"name":"Jinho Choi","affiliation":["School of Engineering, Swansea University, Swansea, UK"],"firstName":"Jinho","lastName":"Choi","id":"37280083000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1053-587X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0476"}],"articleNumber":"5582313","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":884},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Throughput","Resource management","Downlink","Channel capacity","Rate-distortion","Quantization","Resource description framework"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel capacity","feedback","frequency division multiple access","iterative methods","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["downlink throughput maximization","OFDMA systems","feedback channel capacity constraints","orthogonal frequency-division multiple-access systems","information-theoretic lower bound","optimization problems","quantized channel state information","CSI","iterative approach","near-optimal outage throughput"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Limited feedback","orthogonal frequency-division multiple access (OFDMA)","quantized channel information","rate distortion","resource allocation"]}],"abstract":"In this correspondence, we study the downlink throughput maximization for orthogonal frequency-division multiple-access (OFDMA) systems in the presence of feedback channel capacity constraints. We establish an information-theoretic lower bound on the capacity of feedback channel and build the corresponding test channel that achieves this lower bound. Based on the derived test channel, we formulate two optimization problems that maximize the downlink throughput with quantized channel state information (CSI): i) one problem where throughput is defined with the ergodic throughput and ii) the other problem with the outage throughput, from which we can see the performance limit for given limit feedback channels. We solve the throughput maximization problem through an iterative approach, which achieves the optimal ergodic throughput and the near-optimal outage throughput. Numerical results show that the downlink throughput with a limited feedback of CSI can be close to that with perfect CSI by exploiting correlation properties of downlink CSI for quantization.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2010.2080270","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/5662471/05582313.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2010.2080270","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5662471","startPage":"441","endPage":"446","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Downlink Throughput Maximization for OFDMA Systems With Feedback Channel Capacity Constraints","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5582313","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Downlink Throughput Maximization for OFDMA Systems With Feedback Channel Capacity Constraints","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5582313/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 September 2010","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"59","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2011","accessionNumber":"11704214","dateOfInsertion":"17 December 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5582313/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Downlink Throughput Maximization for OFDMA Systems With Feedback Channel Capacity Constraints","sourcePdf":"tsp-bai-2080270-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.071084S","chronDate":"Jan.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"5662471","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"5662471","articleId":"5582313","onlineDate":"23 September 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5582314,"authors":[{"name":"Tadilo Endeshaw Bogale","affiliation":["Communication and Remote Sensing Laboratory, Universit\u00e9 Catholique de Louvain, Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgium"],"firstName":"Tadilo","lastName":"Endeshaw Bogale","id":"38193311400"},{"name":"Batu Krishna Chalise","affiliation":["Center for Advanced Communications, Villanova University, Villanova, PA, USA","Communication and Remote Sensing Laboratory, Universite Catholique de Louvain, Belgium"],"firstName":"Batu Krishna","lastName":"Chalise","id":"38517799300"},{"name":"Luc Vandendorpe","affiliation":["Communication and Remote Sensing Laboratory, Universit\u00e9 Catholique de Louvain, Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgium"],"firstName":"Luc","lastName":"Vandendorpe","id":"37269898400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1053-587X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0476"}],"articleNumber":"5582314","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":39,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":1541},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Downlink","Robustness","Resource management","Optimization","MIMO","Channel estimation","Antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","iterative methods","least mean squares methods","matrix algebra","MIMO communication","minimisation","transceivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["robust transceiver optimization","downlink multiuser MIMO systems","multiple-input multiple-output systems","channel state information","base station","mobile stations","antenna correlation","weighted sum mean-square-error","minimization","maximum weighted MSE","uplink-downlink duality","power allocation matrices","uplink channel","downlink channel","iterative algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Downlink","duality","mean-square error","multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)","multiuser","Robust Transceiver design"]}],"abstract":"This correspondence addresses the joint transceiver design for downlink multiuser multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, with imperfect channel state information (CSI) at the base station (BS) and mobile stations (MSs).

These problems are solved as follows: first, we establish three kinds of MSE uplink-downlink duality by transforming only the power allocation matrices from uplink channel to downlink channel and vice versa. Second, in the uplink channel, we formulate the power allocation part of each problem ensuring global optimality. Finally, based on the solution of the uplink power allocation and the MSE duality results, for each problem, we propose an iterative algorithm that performs optimization alternatively between the uplink and downlink channels.

However, it is an offline bound whose corresponding Fisher information matrix (FIM) is obtained by taking the expectation with respect to all the random variables, namely the measurements and the system states. As a result, this unconditional PCRLB is not well suited for adaptive resource management for dynamic systems. The new concept of conditional PCRLB is proposed and derived in this paper, which is dependent on the actual observation data up to the current time, and is implicitly dependent on the underlying system state. Therefore, it is adaptive to the particular realization of the underlying system state and provides a more accurate and effective online indication of the estimation performance than the unconditional PCRLB. Both the exact conditional PCRLB and its recursive evaluation approach including an approximation are derived. Further, a general sequential Monte Carlo solution is proposed to compute the conditional PCRLB recursively for nonlinear non-Gaussian sequential Bayesian estimation problems. The differences between this new bound and existing measurement dependent PCRLBs are investigated and discussed. Illustrative examples are also provided to show the performance of the proposed conditional PCRLB.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Conditional Posterior Cram\u00e9r\u2013Rao Lower Bounds for Nonlinear Sequential Bayesian Estimation","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2010.2080268","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/5662471/05582316.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"14","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2010.2080268","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5662471","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5582316","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5582316/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 September 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2011","displayDocTitle":"Conditional Posterior Cram\u00e9r\u2013Rao Lower Bounds for Nonlinear Sequential Bayesian Estimation","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"59","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/5582316/","dateOfInsertion":"17 December 2010","publicationDate":"Jan. 2011","accessionNumber":"11704216","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Conditional Posterior Cram\u00e9r\u2013Rao Lower Bounds for Nonlinear Sequential Bayesian Estimation","sourcePdf":"tsp-niu-2080268-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.077309S","chronDate":"Jan.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"5662471","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"75","xplore-issue":"5662471","articleId":"5582316","onlineDate":"23 September 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5582319,"authors":[{"name":"Chao-Yu Chen","affiliation":["Institute of Communications Engineering, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"bio":{"p":["Chao-Yu Chen was born in Keelung, Taiwan, R.O.C., in 1978.

For the purpose of developing semi-active controller, the theory of PID neural network control is adopted here to identify and control the semi-active suspension systems.

However, driver path selection is a multiple criteria decision process. This paper presents a multiobjective path optimisation (MOPO) model to make a more precise simulation of the decision-making behaviour of driver path selection. Three single-objective path optimisation (SOPO) models were taken into account to establish the MOPO model. They relate to cumulative distance (shortest-distance path), passed intersections (least-node path, LNP) and number of turns (minimum-turn path, MTP). To solve the proposed MOPO problem, a two-stage technique which incorporates a path genetic algorithm (PGA) and weight-sum method were developed. To demonstrate the advantages of the MOPO model in assisting drivers in path selection, several empirical studies were conducted using two real road networks with different roadway types and numbers of nodes and links. The experimental results demonstrate the advantage that the MOPO model provides drivers more diverse and richer information than the conventional SDP. It can be concluded that with the aids of the GIS, the optimal paths of the MOPO and SOPO problems can be easily identified by the PGA in just a matter of seconds, despite the fact that these problems are highly complex and difficult to solve manually.","doi":"10.1109/ICNC.2010.5582429","startPage":"2217","endPage":"2222","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 Sixth International Conference on Natural Computation","pdfPath":"/iel5/5564900/5582346/05582429.pdf","publicationTitle":"2010 Sixth International Conference on Natural Computation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNC.2010.5582429","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5582346","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A genetic algorithm for multiobjective path optimisation problem","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Biological cells","Driver circuits","Roads","Electronics packaging","Optimization","Encoding","Network topology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decision making","decision theory","genetic algorithms","road vehicles","transportation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiobjective path optimisation problem","shortest-distance path","driver path selection","multiple criteria decision process","multiobjective path optimisation model","SDP model","MOPO model","single-objective path optimisation model","SOPO model","decision making behaviour","cumulative distance","least-node path","weight-sum method","path genetic algorithm","PGA","road networks","GIS","car navigation systems"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Genetic Algorithm","Path optimisation","Shortest Path","Least Node","Minimum Turn"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5582429/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 Aug. 2010","displayDocTitle":"A genetic algorithm for multiobjective path optimisation problem","isConference":true,"volume":"5","htmlLink":"/document/5582429/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"23 September 2010","conferenceDate":"10-12 Aug. 2010","accessionNumber":"11554530","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A genetic algorithm for multiobjective path optimisation problem","confLoc":"Yantai, China","sourcePdf":"484.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059825S","chronDate":"10-12 Aug. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5564900","isNumber":"5582346","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5564900","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5582346","articleId":"5582429","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5582462,"authors":[{"name":"Panchi Li","affiliation":["School of Computer & Information Technology, Daqing Petroleum Institute, Daqing, Shaanxi, China"],"firstName":"Panchi","lastName":"Li","id":"37595356900"},{"name":"Kaoping Song","affiliation":["Post-Doctoral Research Center of Oil & Gas Engineering, Daqing Petroleum Institute, Daqing, Shaanxi, China"],"firstName":"Kaoping","lastName":"Song","id":"37330584600"},{"name":"Erlong Yang","affiliation":["Post-Doctoral Research Center of Oil & Gas Engineering, Daqing Petroleum Institute, Daqing, Shaanxi, China"],"firstName":"Erlong","lastName":"Yang","id":"37331229800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5961-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5958-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5959-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-9555"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-9563"}],"articleNumber":"5582462","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":122},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optimization","Biological cells","Algorithm design and analysis","Logic gates","Fuzzy control","Artificial neural networks","Fuzzy neural networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["backpropagation","control system synthesis","fuzzy control","genetic algorithms","neurocontrollers","nonlinear control systems","quantum gates"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["quantum genetic algorithm","normalized fuzzy neural controller","BP algorithm","quantum rotation gates","quantum nongates","probability amplitudes","inverted pendulum system"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["quantum genetic algorithm","fuzzy neural network","parameter optimization","fuzzy control"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5582462","abstract":"Aiming at the BP algorithm convergence difficulty for fuzzy neural controller with many parameters, a quantum genetic algorithm is proposed to optimize the parameters of a normalized fuzzy neural controller.

Now that most cell phones include at least one camera, consumers are starting to ask for better image quality and resolution - without compromising on the cost. Many applications including mobile electronics, automotive, medical, security and laptop computers, require reliable, small form factor, high level functionality integration and low manufacturing cost digital camera modules. To satisfy these demands, Tessera has developed Wafer-Level Camera (WLC) technology, which includes wafer level packaging of image sensor, wafer level optics (WLO) and wafer level integration of optics. This enables manufacturers to significantly advance the integration of miniaturized cameras. Compared to traditional camera module manufacturing technology, where optical lenses are made by either molded glass or injection molded plastics, in WLO, thousands of optical lenses or lens assemblies are fabricated simultaneously on a wafer-scale using photopolymer replication and wafer bonding technologies. Wafer-scale optics and wafer-scale integration offer a smaller form factor, lower manufacturing costs, and improved reliability over conventional designs.

UEP can be effectively used for graceful quality degradation under harsh network conditions. The Digital Video Broadcasting (DVB) organization recently introduced second generations of broadcast transmission technologies like DVB-T2 and DVB-S2. These technologies, due to the newly introduced and advanced tools, ensure better quality of service compared to their respective first generation counterparts. Among the important tools that directly affect the quality of service positively in these emerging technologies is the new physical layer-chained forward error correction coding. In both cases, the chained codes comprise of a Bose-Chaudhuri-Hocquenghem (BCH) code, which functions as the outer code, followed by a Low-Density Parity Check (LDPC) code as the inner code. To allow for improved graceful quality degradation in the second generation DVB broadcast technologies, this article proposes a novel method to extend deployed LDPC codes. This code extension enables the implementation of UEP schemes in an effective manner in these DVB broadcast systems. Furthermore, the proposed solution is backward compatible to legacy receivers. The performance evaluation of the proposed method is supported by results, obtained through simulations.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"LDPC FEC code extension for unequal error protection in 2nd generation DVB systems","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Multimedia and Expo","doi":"10.1109/ICME.2010.5582541","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Multimedia and Expo","pdfPath":"/iel5/5570012/5582530/05582541.pdf","startPage":"504","endPage":"509","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICME.2010.5582541","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5582530","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5582541","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5582541/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-23 July 2010","displayDocTitle":"LDPC FEC code extension for unequal error protection in 2nd generation DVB systems","conferenceDate":"19-23 July 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5582541/","dateOfInsertion":"23 September 2010","publicationDate":"July 2010","accessionNumber":"11555297","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"LDPC FEC code extension for unequal error protection in 2nd generation DVB systems","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"P1716.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047757S","chronDate":"19-23 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5570012","isNumber":"5582530","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5570012","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5582530","articleId":"5582541","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":5582543,"authors":[{"name":"Feng Lu","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Engineering, Northeastern University, Shenyang, China"],"firstName":"Feng","lastName":"Lu","id":"37535274800"},{"name":"Yanfeng Ge","affiliation":["Electric Power Company Limited, Shenyang, China"],"lastName":"Yanfeng Ge","id":"37535528500"},{"name":"LiQun Gao","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Engineering, Northeastern University, Shenyang, China"],"lastName":"LiQun Gao","id":"37274359700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5961-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5958-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5959-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-9555"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-9563"}],"articleNumber":"5582543","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":231},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Particle swarm optimization","Convergence","Simulation","Tuning","Heuristic algorithms","Optimization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","convergence","particle swarm optimisation","search problems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["self-adaptive particle swarm optimization algorithm","global optimization","PSO algorithm","population-based stochastic search technique","continuous search domain","optimization problem solving","premature convergence","SaPSO","deception multiple local optima","computational complexity","velocity update rule","negative feedback technique","benchmark test functions"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5582543","abstract":"Particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is a simple yet powerful population-based stochastic search technique for solving optimization problems in the continuous search domain.

In this paper, we propose a novel approach to tackling this problem based on the ergodic hidden Markov model (EHMM) supervector representation of facial images. First, the scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT) feature vectors are extracted from a dense grid of every facial images. Next, an EHMM is trained over all facial images in the training set and is referred to as the universal background model (UBM). The UBM is then maximum a posteriori adapted to each facial image in the training and test sets to produce the image-specific EHMMs. Based on these EHMMs, we derive a supervector representation of the facial images by means of an upper bound approximation of the Kullback-Leibler divergence rate between two EHMMs. Finally, facial expression recognition is performed in the linear discriminant subspace of the EHMM supervectors using the k-nearest-neighbor classification algorithm. Our experiments of recognizing six universal facial expressions over extensive multiview facial images with seven pan angles (-45\u00b0 ~ +45\u00b0) and five tilt angles (-30\u00b0 ~ +30\u00b0), which are synthesized from the BU-3DFE facial expression database, show promising results compared to the state of the arts recently reported.","doi":"10.1109/ICME.2010.5582576","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Multimedia and Expo","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Multimedia and Expo","pdfPath":"/iel5/5570012/5582530/05582576.pdf","startPage":"1202","endPage":"1207","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICME.2010.5582576","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5582530","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Non-frontal view facial expression recognition based on ergodic hidden Markov model supervectors","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5582576","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-23 July 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5582576/","displayDocTitle":"Non-frontal view facial expression recognition based on ergodic hidden Markov model supervectors","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2010","accessionNumber":"11555443","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5582576/","conferenceDate":"19-23 July 2010","dateOfInsertion":"23 September 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Non-frontal view facial expression recognition based on ergodic hidden Markov model supervectors","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"P1600.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.083331S","chronDate":"19-23 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5570012","isNumber":"5582530","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5570012","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"5582530","articleId":"5582576","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":5582633,"authors":[{"name":"Chen Xiaoyong","affiliation":["School of Mechanical & Electrical Engineering, Guilin University of Electronic Technology, Guangxi, P.

An uneven clustering result leads to severe energy imbalance in WSNs, which shortens the life time of networks. This paper presents a strategy to obtain good clustering result by directly using an improved DPSO algorithm. The phenomenon of premature stagnation of elementary Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is avoided by proposing mutant strategy and mixed dynamic inertia weight adjustment strategy, heuristic algorithms are also presented to help find global best solution efficiently in this paper. Remaining energy of cluster heads (CHs) is taken into consideration in the process of clustering too.

distance sorting based multiobjective particle swarm optimization algorithm","abstract":"Aiming at shortcomings in global searching capacity and diversity of Pareto set existing in the traditional MOPSO, a crowding distance sorting based multiobjective particle swarm optimization algorithm (DSMOPSO) is proposed. With the elitism strategy, the evolution of the external population is achieved based on individuals' crowding distance sorting by descending order, to delete the redundant individuals in the crowding area. The update of the global optimum is performed by selecting an individual with a relatively bigger crowding distance, to lead the particles evolving to the disperse region. A small ratio mutation is introduced to the inner swarm to enhance the global searching capacity. So the number of Pareto optimal solutions can be controlled, and the convergence and diversity of Pareto optimal set can be guaranteed as well. Effectiveness of the algorithm with two and three objectives is proved by the optimization of three standard test problems. Comparison results illustrate that it outperformed NSGA-II and SPEA2 in the convergence and diversity characteristics of Pareto optimal front. The sensitivity of control parameters is analyzed to illustrate the algorithm's robustness.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 Aug. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5582682/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11554559","isConference":true,"volume":"5","htmlLink":"/document/5582682/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"23 September 2010","conferenceDate":"10-12 Aug. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"DSMOPSO: A distance sorting based multiobjective particle swarm optimization algorithm","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"DSMOPSO: A distance sorting based multiobjective particle swarm optimization algorithm","confLoc":"Yantai, China","sourcePdf":"596.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048716S","chronDate":"10-12 Aug. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5564900","isNumber":"5582346","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5564900","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5582346","articleId":"5582682","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":5582713,"authors":[{"name":"J.

A tangent hyperbolic function is used as the activation function, and the back propagation error is approximated by a linear combination of error and error's differential. The simulation results reveal that the proposed speed regulator keeps motor in constant speed with high convergent speed, but the convergent speed is affected by the sampling frequency. In general, the high sampling frequency will make the speed control system have favor performance, but it will take lots of CPU time.

However, traditional methods called single-link traffic flow forecasting usually predict one link's unidirectional traffic flow at a time, which do not take the relevance of adjacent links into account and make the ITS have a low efficiency. In this paper, we propose a new approach named multi-link traffic flow forecasting using neural networks (NNs), which can predict traffic flows on all the road links of one junction simultaneously. Experimental results show that it can not only increase the efficiency of ITS but also improve the performance of prediction. Furthermore, we combine multi-task learning with the multi-link traffic flow forecasting and obtain a better performance of prediction. All these experiments indicate that the multi-link traffic flow forecasting is a much more effective approach for traffic flow forecasting.","doi":"10.1109/ICNC.2010.5582914","pdfPath":"/iel5/5564900/5582888/05582914.pdf","startPage":"398","endPage":"401","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 Sixth International Conference on Natural Computation","publicationTitle":"2010 Sixth International Conference on Natural Computation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNC.2010.5582914","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5582888","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-link traffic flow forecasting using neural networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5582914/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 Aug. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Multi-link traffic flow forecasting using neural networks","isConference":true,"volume":"1","dateOfInsertion":"23 September 2010","accessionNumber":"11555153","publicationDate":"Aug. 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5582914/","conferenceDate":"10-12 Aug. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-link traffic flow forecasting using neural networks","confLoc":"Yantai, China","sourcePdf":"88.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062451S","chronDate":"10-12 Aug. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5564900","isNumber":"5582888","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5564900","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"5582888","articleId":"5582914","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5582915,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaoli Liang","affiliation":["University Normal College, Eastern Liaoning University, Dandong, China"],"firstName":"Xiaoli","lastName":"Liang","id":"38195585200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5961-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5958-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5959-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-9555"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-9563"}],"articleNumber":"5582915","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":161},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5582915","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Nonlinear dynamical systems","Backstepping","Artificial neural networks","Robust control","Adaptive control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive control","control system analysis","control system synthesis","neurocontrollers","nonlinear control systems","robust control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["stability analysis","adaptive neural network backstepping control","adaptive neural network robust control","single-input-single-output nonlinear systems","completely unknown virtual control direction","unknown nonlinearities","unmodeled dynamics","dynamic disturbances","backstepping recursive design","dynamic signal","nonlinear damping terms","Nussbaum function"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["nonlinear system","neural network","adaptive control","backstepping method","stability analysis"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICNC.2010.5582915","pdfPath":"/iel5/5564900/5582885/05582915.pdf","publicationTitle":"2010 Sixth International Conference on Natural Computation","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 Sixth International Conference on Natural Computation","startPage":"1017","endPage":"1023","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5582885","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNC.2010.5582915","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design and stability analysis for an adaptive neural network backstepping control of nonlinear system","abstract":"In this paper, an adaptive neural network robust control approach is proposed for a class of SISO(single-input-single-output) nonlinear systems with completely unknown virtual control direction, unknown nonlinearities, unmodeled dynamics and dynamic disturbances.

It has been recognized as a reliable device fingerprint for source camera/scanner identification and image origin verification. However, one weakness of current sensor pattern noise-based camera fingerprints is that their construction only uses information from single color channel images. The resultant fingerprint can not comprehensively reflect characteristics of the camera sensor array. Taking into account the characteristics of the CFA (color filter array) structure, this work proposes a new way to construct camera fingerprints using information from all of the three single color channel images.

Herein, we propose a new classifier that is a neural network classifier based on prior evolution and iterative approximation, which can satisfy the aforementioned special requirements. Through the analyses of experiments, it is proved to do well in leaf recognition and shows its good classification performance.","doi":"10.1109/ICNC.2010.5582971","startPage":"1038","endPage":"1043","publicationTitle":"2010 Sixth International Conference on Natural Computation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNC.2010.5582971","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5582885","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 Sixth International Conference on Natural Computation","pdfPath":"/iel5/5564900/5582885/05582971.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A neural network classifier based on prior evolution and iterative approximation used for leaf recognition","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5582971/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A neural network classifier based on prior evolution and iterative approximation used for leaf recognition","isConference":true,"volume":"2","htmlLink":"/document/5582971/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11554928","publicationDate":"Aug. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"23 September 2010","conferenceDate":"10-12 Aug. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 Aug. 2010","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A neural network classifier based on prior evolution and iterative approximation used for leaf recognition","confLoc":"Yantai, China","sourcePdf":"229.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.082272S","chronDate":"10-12 Aug. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5564900","isNumber":"5582885","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5564900","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"5582885","articleId":"5582971","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":5582986,"authors":[{"name":"Qian Liu","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, State University of New York, University at Buffalo, Buffalo, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Qian","lastName":"Liu","id":"37713756900"},{"name":"Shujie Liu","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, State University of New York, University at Buffalo, Buffalo, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Shujie","lastName":"Liu","id":"37578512700"},{"name":"Chang Wen Chen","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, State University of New York, University at Buffalo, Buffalo, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Chang Wen","lastName":"Chen","id":"37280734300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7493-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7491-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-7492-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1945-788X"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1945-7871"},{"format":"CD","value":"1945-7871"}],"articleNumber":"5582986","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":14,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":311},"abstract":"Spatial multiplexing MIMO wireless system is an excellent choice for next generation broadband multimedia communications because of its parallel transmission capability. A major challenge for such MIMO system is that it usually requires appropriate decomposition of both wireless channels and multimedia data bitstreams. Existing approaches to MIMO channel decomposition have been passively based on simple channel feedback. To facilitate proper match between decomposed channels with compressed video that exhibit variable priority for different layer of bitstreams, it is necessary to proactively prioritize the decomposed MIMO channels. We present in this paper a novel pre-coding scheme capable of integrating both channel and source characteristics in order to achieve the desired prioritized spatial multiplexing. This pre-coding scheme is applied to the transmission of video data compressed with H.264 Scalable Video Coding (SVC) standard. Based on the desired bit-error-rate (BER) and signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) for each SVC video layer, the base layer video is proactively assigned the highest priority sub-channel to guarantee minimum required quality while enhancement layers are mapped to other lower priority sub-channels. Comparing with existing schemes, the proposed pre-coder has low computational complexity and is suitable for rapid hardware implementation. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed prioritized spatial multiplexing approach can efficiently enhance the quality of SVC video streaming over MIMO systems.","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Multimedia and Expo","pdfPath":"/iel5/5570012/5582530/05582986.pdf","startPage":"968","endPage":"973","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Multimedia and Expo","doi":"10.1109/ICME.2010.5582986","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICME.2010.5582986","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5582530","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5582986","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel prioritized spatial multiplexing for MIMO wireless system with application to H.264 SVC video","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Streaming media","MIMO","Bit error rate","Multiplexing","Signal to noise ratio","Static VAr compensators","Video sequences"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data compression","MIMO communication","multimedia communication","multiplexing","video coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["prioritized spatial multiplexing","MIMO wireless system","H.264 SVC video","broadband multimedia communications","video data compression","H.264 scalable video coding","precoder"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Prioritized spatial multiplexing","scalable video transmission","MIMO system","pre-coding matrix"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5582986/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-23 July 2010","displayDocTitle":"A novel prioritized spatial multiplexing for MIMO wireless system with application to H.264 SVC video","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5582986/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2010","accessionNumber":"11555457","dateOfInsertion":"23 September 2010","conferenceDate":"19-23 July 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel prioritized spatial multiplexing for MIMO wireless system with application to H.264 SVC video","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"P1905.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039738S","chronDate":"19-23 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5570012","isNumber":"5582530","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5570012","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"5582530","articleId":"5582986","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5582991,"authors":[{"name":"Li Wan","affiliation":["College of Science, Wuhan Textile University, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Li","lastName":"Wan","id":"37669369700"},{"name":"Qinghua Zhou","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics, Zhaoqing University, Zhaoqing, China"],"firstName":"Qinghua","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37875692500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5961-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5958-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5959-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-9555"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-9563"}],"articleNumber":"5582991","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":54},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Delay","Artificial neural networks","Asymptotic stability","Stability criteria","Recurrent neural networks","Stochastic processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["asymptotic stability","delays","recurrent neural nets","stability criteria","stochastic processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["exponential stability","stochastic recurrent neural network","time-varying delay","delay function"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5582991","abstract":"The stability of stochastic recurrent neural networks with time-varying delays is investigated.

The rich acoustic information they carry cannot be fully described with single or even multiple terms about the acoustic sources alone. For instance, the label birds assigned to a birds singing clip that includes sounds of trees and a small river does not properly capture the experience it creates in the person listening to it. In this paper we introduce a novel scheme where the subjective experience of listening to sound clips containing mixture of sources is captured using affective measures. Furthermore, in contrast to the conventional approach of simple label-based methods, the affective ratings are then used to evaluate the performance of an example-based audio retrieval system. We argue that audio retrieval systems can benefit from using affective measures which are well established in experimental psychology, especially when dealing with real world audio clips. We present experimental results of our pilot study to support this motivation where the latent indexing framework has been employed for example-based retrieval on a collection of clips from the BBC sound effects library. The result of our study indicates that using the scheme of affective measures for representation and evaluation is indeed a promising direction to explore.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Acoustics","Indexing","Libraries","Acoustic measurements","Feature extraction","Semantics","Motion pictures"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["audio signal processing","content-based retrieval"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["example-based audio retrieval system","affective dimensions","subjective listening experience","experimental psychology","BBC sound effects library"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Affective dimensions","latent analysis and indexing","indexing user generated content","unstructured audio","content-based processing","unit-document frequencies"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICME.2010.5583001","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Multimedia and Expo","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Multimedia and Expo","pdfPath":"/iel5/5570012/5582530/05583001.pdf","startPage":"573","endPage":"577","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5582530","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICME.2010.5583001","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Towards evaluation of example-based audio retrieval system using affective dimensions","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5583001","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Towards evaluation of example-based audio retrieval system using affective dimensions","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5583001/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5583001/","accessionNumber":"11555369","conferenceDate":"19-23 July 2010","dateOfInsertion":"23 September 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-23 July 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Towards evaluation of example-based audio retrieval system using affective dimensions","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"P1951.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04825S","chronDate":"19-23 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5570012","isNumber":"5582530","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5570012","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"5582530","articleId":"5583001","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5583006,"authors":[{"name":"Gary McKeown","affiliation":["Department of Psychology, Queen's University Belfast, UK"],"firstName":"Gary","lastName":"McKeown","id":"37670598600"},{"name":"Michel F.

One of the most important challenges for such stereophonic system is the problem of stereophonic acoustic echo cancellation (SAEC) where a pair of echo cancellers are deployed to estimate the acoustic impulse responses of the receiving room. We propose, in this paper, a neural network based adaptive filtering approach for SAEC. The neural network is employed to decorrelate the input vectors for efficient filter updating, resulting in a high convergence rate of the adaptive filters for this multi-channel acoustic application. To further enhance the efficiency of the proposed algorithm, we then utilize the joint-input correlation matrix of the stereophonic signals so as to simplify the proposed neural network. Simulation results show the improvement in performance of the proposed adaptive SAEC approach over the state-of-the-art algorithms.","doi":"10.1109/ICME.2010.5583025","pdfPath":"/iel5/5570012/5582530/05583025.pdf","startPage":"1172","endPage":"1177","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Multimedia and Expo","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Multimedia and Expo","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICME.2010.5583025","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5582530","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neural network based adaptive echo cancellation for stereophonic teleconferencing application","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5583025/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-23 July 2010","displayDocTitle":"Neural network based adaptive echo cancellation for stereophonic teleconferencing application","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"23 September 2010","accessionNumber":"11555417","publicationDate":"July 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5583025/","conferenceDate":"19-23 July 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural network based adaptive echo cancellation for stereophonic teleconferencing application","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"P1982.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.143214S","chronDate":"19-23 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5570012","isNumber":"5582530","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5570012","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5582530","articleId":"5583025","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":5583091,"authors":[{"name":"Chang-ming Ji","affiliation":["The New and Renewable Energy of Beijing Key Laboratory, North China Electric Power University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Chang-ming","lastName":"Ji","id":"37533521800"},{"name":"Wei Xie","affiliation":["The New and Renewable Energy of Beijing Key Laboratory, North China Electric Power University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Xie","id":"37669712800"},{"name":"Shan Yu","affiliation":["The New and Renewable Energy of Beijing Key Laboratory, North China Electric Power University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Shan","lastName":"Yu","id":"38195386600"},{"name":"Xin-liang Zhu","affiliation":["Hunan Dong Jiang Hydroelectric Power Station, Zixing, Hunan, China"],"firstName":"Xin-liang","lastName":"Zhu","id":"38195182400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5961-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5958-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5959-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-9555"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-9563"}],"articleNumber":"5583091","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":133},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Economics","Hydroelectric power generation","Particle swarm optimization","Artificial neural networks","Mathematical model","Power systems","Genetics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hydroelectric power stations","particle swarm optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["virus particle swarm optimization algorithm","hydropower station","virus evolutionary mechanism","particle swarm algorithm","host population","virus population","genetic information"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["PSO algorithm","virus evolutionary","economic operation","hydropower station"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5583091","abstract":"The virus particle swarm optimization algorithm (VPSO), which integrates the virus evolutionary mechanism into the particle swarm algorithm (PSO), is presented in this paper.

Some appropriate image processing algorithms are used to eliminate the noise. Then, single character image is obtained after character segmentation and character normalization. Finally, a three-layer back propagation (BP) neural network module is constructed. In order to improve the convergence rate of the network and avoid oscillation and divergence, the BP algorithm with momentum item is used. As a result, the SMT product character recognition system is developed, and its implementation method and steps are introduced with practical examples.

Experiment results indicate that RBF algorithm is better than the kalman filter, which can obtain more precise and more robust position information.","doi":"10.1109/ICNC.2010.5583145","publicationTitle":"2010 Sixth International Conference on Natural Computation","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 Sixth International Conference on Natural Computation","pdfPath":"/iel5/5564900/5582888/05583145.pdf","startPage":"480","endPage":"484","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5582888","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNC.2010.5583145","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Positions research of agriculture vehicle navigation system based on Radial Basis Function neural network and Particle Swarm Optimization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5583145/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 Aug. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Positions research of agriculture vehicle navigation system based on Radial Basis Function neural network and Particle Swarm Optimization","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5583145/","dateOfInsertion":"23 September 2010","publicationDate":"Aug. 2010","accessionNumber":"11555165","conferenceDate":"10-12 Aug. 2010","isConference":true,"volume":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Positions research of agriculture vehicle navigation system based on Radial Basis Function neural network and Particle Swarm Optimization","confLoc":"Yantai, China","sourcePdf":"106.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067697S","chronDate":"10-12 Aug. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5564900","isNumber":"5582888","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5564900","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5582888","articleId":"5583145","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5583151,"authors":[{"name":"Hongwei Liu","affiliation":["School of Information, Beijing Wuzi University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Hongwei","lastName":"Liu","id":"38195350100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5961-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5958-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5959-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-9555"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-9563"}],"articleNumber":"5583151","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":21,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":963},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5583151","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Artificial neural networks","Training","Biological neural networks","Neurons","Cost function","Jacobian matrices"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feedforward neural nets","optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Levenberg Marquardt training method","feedforward neural networks","neural networks literature","cost function","Matlab application"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICNC.2010.5583151","pdfPath":"/iel5/5564900/5582888/05583151.pdf","publicationTitle":"2010 Sixth International Conference on Natural Computation","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 Sixth International Conference on Natural Computation","startPage":"456","endPage":"460","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5582888","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNC.2010.5583151","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Levenberg-Marquardt training method for feed-forward neural networks","abstract":"The Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) training method is the most effective method for feed-forward neural networks with respect to the training precision.

Based on the random sampling lemma, the training dataset was firstly decomposed into subsets and each OC-SVM of subset was trained by Sequential Minimal Optimization (SMO). The combining lemmas of support vectors and outliers of OC-SVM were deduced. A new decision boundary was merged by decomposing and combining lemmas (DC).

In this sensor, the motion vector is detected by single pixel matching with a limited search range and high inter-frame correlation at a high frame rate. In this paper, we have proposed a new method of on-sensor motion detection for noise reduction and improvement of motion direction accuracy. In this method, we implemented two new functions on the sensor. We fabricated the prototype chip using a 0.35 um CMOS process. Furthermore, we explained the methods for estimating the motion trajectory of this imaging device by using the output from the sensor and for estimating the motion direction of a moving object along the depth direction; these two methods are the applications of this sensor. The simulation results show that the proposed on-sensor motion vector detection is more effective than our previously proposed method.","doi":"10.1109/ICME.2010.5583291","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Multimedia and Expo","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Multimedia and Expo","pdfPath":"/iel5/5570012/5582530/05583291.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICME.2010.5583291","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5582530","startPage":"872","endPage":"877","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High-speed-computational image sensor for detection of 2D motion vector by using single pixel matching","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5583291","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"High-speed-computational image sensor for detection of 2D motion vector by using single pixel matching","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-23 July 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5583291/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"19-23 July 2010","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2010","accessionNumber":"11555352","dateOfInsertion":"23 September 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5583291/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High-speed-computational image sensor for detection of 2D motion vector by using single pixel matching","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"P2126.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063455S","chronDate":"19-23 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5570012","isNumber":"5582530","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5570012","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5582530","articleId":"5583291","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":5583297,"authors":[{"name":"Ying Wu","affiliation":["Department of Automation and Systems Technology, Aalto University, Espoo, Finland","Department of Control Theory and Engineering, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Ying","lastName":"Wu","id":"37966281500"},{"name":"Xiao-Zhi Gao","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Aalto University, Espoo, Finland","Department of Control Theory and Engineering, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Xiao-Zhi","lastName":"Gao","id":"37334989400"},{"name":"Xian-Lin Huang","affiliation":["Department of Control Theory and Engineering, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Xian-Lin","lastName":"Huang","id":"37423927800"},{"name":"Kai Zenger","affiliation":["Department of Automation and Systems Technology, Aalto University, Espoo, Finland"],"firstName":"Kai","lastName":"Zenger","id":"37300024800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5961-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5958-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5959-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-9555"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-9563"}],"articleNumber":"5583297","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":190},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optimization","Particle swarm optimization","Convergence","Cultural differences","Neodymium","Programming"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["evolutionary computation","particle swarm optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hybrid optimization method","particle swarm optimization algorithm","cultural algorithm","PSOCCA","population component","differential evolution","unique mutation operator","variation ratio","swarm population","multipeak functions"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["cultural algorithm (CA)","particle swarm optimization (PSO)","differential evolution (DE)","hybrid optimization methods","mutation operator"]}],"abstract":"A novel hybrid optimization algorithm, PSOCCA, based on the fusion of the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Cultural Algorithm (CA), is proposed in this paper to enhance the convergence characteristics of the original PSO. In the PSOCCA, the particle swarm is considered to be a population component of the CA, and three knowledge sources are stored in the belief space to update the population space and establish the relationship between the two CA spaces. A unique mutation operator inspired by the Differential Evolution (DE) is used to mutate those particles with unsatisfactory performances in the population space. A new kind of knowledge, average value knowledge, that is stored in the belief space, is also introduced to regulate the variation ratio in the swarm population. The optimization performance of our PSOCCA is investigated using ten high-dimension and multi-peak functions. Simulation results demonstrate that it can be superior to the regular PSO.","publicationTitle":"2010 Sixth International Conference on Natural Computation","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 Sixth International Conference on Natural Computation","pdfPath":"/iel5/5564900/5582346/05583297.pdf","startPage":"2515","endPage":"2519","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A hybrid optimization method of Particle Swarm Optimization and Cultural Algorithm","doi":"10.1109/ICNC.2010.5583297","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5582346","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNC.2010.5583297","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5583297","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5583297/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 Aug. 2010","displayDocTitle":"A hybrid optimization method of Particle Swarm Optimization and Cultural Algorithm","dateOfInsertion":"23 September 2010","publicationDate":"Aug. 2010","accessionNumber":"11554562","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"5","conferenceDate":"10-12 Aug. 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5583297/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A hybrid optimization method of Particle Swarm Optimization and Cultural Algorithm","confLoc":"Yantai, China","sourcePdf":"547.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070966S","chronDate":"10-12 Aug. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5564900","isNumber":"5582346","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5564900","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5582346","articleId":"5583297","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5583300,"authors":[{"name":"Xing Wen","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Xing","lastName":"Wen","id":"37531544400"},{"name":"Oscar C.

The ME algorithms can be divided into full search ME (FS) and fast ME (FME). The FS is not suitable for high definition (HD) frame size videos because its relevant high computation load and hard to deal with complex motions in limited search range. A lot of FME algorithms have been proposed which can significantly reduce the computation load compared to FS. Though many kinds of hardware implementations of ME have been proposed, almost all of them fail to consider about the motion vector field (MVF) coherence and rate-distortion (RD) cost which have significant impact to the coding efficiency. In this paper, we propose a hardware friendly ME algorithm and corresponding highly data reusable hardware architecture. Simulation results show that the proposed ME algorithm performs better RD performance than conventional FME algorithm. The proposed reconfigurable ME hardware is implemented in VHDL and mapped to a low cost Xilinx XC3S1500 FPGA. It works at 100MHz and is capable to process 1920 \u00d7 1080 of 30fps video format in real time and have very high data reuse ratio.","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Multimedia and Expo","pdfPath":"/iel5/5570012/5582530/05583300.pdf","startPage":"220","endPage":"225","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Multimedia and Expo","doi":"10.1109/ICME.2010.5583300","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICME.2010.5583300","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5582530","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5583300","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A highly data reusable and standard-compliant motion estimation hardware architecture","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hardware","Clocks","Pixel","Arrays","Video coding","Motion estimation","Encoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer architecture","data compression","image processing equipment","motion estimation","video coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["highly data reusable","standard compliant motion estimation hardware architecture","video compression process","high definition frame size video","computation load reduction","motion vector field","MVF coherence","rate distortion cost","hardware friendly ME algorithm","data reusable hardware architecture","VHDL","low cost Xilinx XC3S1500 FPGA","30 fps video format","frequency 100 MHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["motion estimation","hardware implementation","VHDL"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5583300/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-23 July 2010","displayDocTitle":"A highly data reusable and standard-compliant motion estimation hardware architecture","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5583300/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2010","accessionNumber":"11555403","dateOfInsertion":"23 September 2010","conferenceDate":"19-23 July 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A highly data reusable and standard-compliant motion estimation hardware architecture","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"P2128.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.094932S","chronDate":"19-23 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5570012","isNumber":"5582530","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5570012","xplore-issue":"5582530","articleId":"5583300","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5583311,"authors":[{"name":"Ming Li","affiliation":["College of Marine Geo-science, Ocean University of China, OUC, Qingdao, China"],"firstName":"Ming","lastName":"Li","id":"37085937877"},{"name":"Jinliang Zhang","affiliation":["College of resources science & technology, Beijing Normal University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jinliang","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37311566300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5961-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5958-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5959-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-9555"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-9563"}],"articleNumber":"5583311","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":142},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5583311","abstract":"In recent years, artificial-neural-network (ANN) technology has been applied successfully to many petroleum engineering problems, including reservoir logging fluid identification.

We set the output vector as x and y, so that the train sample with fluid type can be reflected to a two-dimensional crossplot and create four point of intersections represent oil, oil & water, water and dry layer respectively. With this trained crossplot, inputting well logs of the layer to be identified, using Euclidean distance to calculate the distance between the result and the four fluid type crossing points and find the shortest one, we can obtain the fluid type of this layer.

In addition, the concept of elite strategy is adopted in HBPSO. HBPSO not only eliminates the redundancy of feature, but also solves the problem of SVM's parameters selection simultaneously. The proposed approach is tested on two datasets: Crohn's disease and Lung cancer.

Some mathematical methods such as memorial property, diversity and self-adaptive feature of the natural immune system are introduced which prevent premature problem of GA effectively and acquire global optimum with high speed during the iterative procedure. Moreover, a coding strategy, representing distribution system features, is adopted which codes the switches of the tie switch-decided loop in the same chromosome. The improved coding strategy can effectively prohibit invalid solution, reduce search space and accelerate speed. A 33-bus distribution system is tested and the corresponding results demonstrate the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed method for application.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 Aug. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5583359/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11555079","isConference":true,"volume":"1","htmlLink":"/document/5583359/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"23 September 2010","conferenceDate":"10-12 Aug. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"An immune genetic algorithm based approach for distribution system reconfiguration","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An immune genetic algorithm based approach for distribution system reconfiguration","confLoc":"Yantai, China","sourcePdf":"22.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039936S","chronDate":"10-12 Aug. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5564900","isNumber":"5582888","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5564900","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5582888","articleId":"5583359","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":5583387,"authors":[{"name":"Chenwei Deng","affiliation":["School of Computer Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Chenwei","lastName":"Deng","id":"37593808400"},{"name":"Weisi Lin","affiliation":["School of Computer Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Weisi","lastName":"Lin","id":"37278116000"},{"name":"Bu-sung Lee","affiliation":["School of Computer Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Bu-sung","lastName":"Lee","id":"37281110400"},{"name":"Chiew Tong Lau","affiliation":["School of Computer Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Chiew Tong","lastName":"Lau","id":"37278500700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7493-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7491-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-7492-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1945-788X"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1945-7871"},{"format":"CD","value":"1945-7871"}],"articleNumber":"5583387","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":23,"citationCountPatent":8,"totalDownloads":947},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image coding","Discrete wavelet transforms","Image reconstruction","Codecs","PSNR","Robustness","Decoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["codecs","combined source-channel coding","discrete wavelet transforms","image coding","image reconstruction","minimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["robust image compression","compressive sensing","image compression methods","JPEG2000","source coding","discrete wavelet transform","sparse representation","2D DWT","CS measurements","discrete wavelet coefficients","image reconstruction","minimization","CS-based image codec","error protection","joint source channel coding schemes","JSCC schemes"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Robust image compression","Compressive sensing","Packet-loss","Joint source channel coding"]}],"abstract":"The existing image compression methods (e.g., JPEG2000, etc.) are vulnerable to bit-loss, and this is usually tackled by channel coding that follows. However, source coding and channel coding have conflicting requirement. In this paper, we address the problem with an alternative paradigm, and a novel compressive sensing (CS) based compression scheme is therefore proposed. Discrete wavelet transform (DWT) is applied for sparse representation, and based on the property of 2-D DWT, a fast CS measurements taking method is presented.

Compressed sensing is proposed to effectuate such a reduction in image quality wherein certain images are acquired with random measurements at a reduced sampling rate via projection onto a random basis of lower dimension. To recover such projected images, compressed-sensing recovery incorporating disparity compensation is employed. Based on a recent compressed-sensing recovery algorithm for images that couples an iterative projection-based reconstruction with a smoothing step, the proposed algorithm drives image recovery using the projection-domain residual between the random measurements of the image in question and a disparity-based prediction created from adjacent, high-quality images. Experimental results reveal that the disparity-based reconstruction significantly outperforms direct reconstruction using simply the random measurements of the image alone.","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Multimedia and Expo","pdfPath":"/iel5/5570012/5582530/05583411.pdf","startPage":"1225","endPage":"1229","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Multimedia and Expo","doi":"10.1109/ICME.2010.5583411","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICME.2010.5583411","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5582530","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5583411","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Disparity-compensated compressed-sensing reconstruction for multiview images","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image reconstruction","PSNR","Prediction algorithms","Discrete wavelet transforms","Discrete cosine transforms","Image coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image reconstruction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["disparity-compensated compressed-sensing reconstruction","multiview images","image acquisition costs","image quality","reduced sampling rate","compressed-sensing recovery","disparity compensation","iterative projection-based reconstruction","smoothing step","image recovery","projection-domain residual","random measurement","high-quality images"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Compressed sensing","multiview","disparity compensation","directional transforms"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5583411/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-23 July 2010","displayDocTitle":"Disparity-compensated compressed-sensing reconstruction for multiview images","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5583411/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2010","accessionNumber":"11555237","dateOfInsertion":"23 September 2010","conferenceDate":"19-23 July 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Disparity-compensated compressed-sensing reconstruction for multiview images","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"P2208.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063402S","chronDate":"19-23 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5570012","isNumber":"5582530","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5570012","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"5582530","articleId":"5583411","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5583418,"authors":[{"name":"Xiuhong Wang","affiliation":["School of Management, Tianjin University, TJU, Tianjin, China"],"firstName":"Xiuhong","lastName":"Wang","id":"37424011100"},{"name":"Qingli Qiao","affiliation":["School of Biomedical Engineering, Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin, China"],"firstName":"Qingli","lastName":"Qiao","id":"37415423300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5961-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5958-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5959-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-9555"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-9563"}],"articleNumber":"5583418","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":119},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Artificial neural networks","Shortest path problem","Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","Neurons","Chaos","Routing","Transient analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","graph theory","matrix algebra","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["shortest path routing problem","fast searching strategy","hysteretic neural network","transient chaos","eigenvectors","weight matrix"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["hysteretic neural networks","transient chaos","fast searching strategy","shortest path problem"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5583418","abstract":"In this paper a new shortest path routing algorithm is presented.

Realization method of NGA is also designed. In this method, penalty function is used as constraints to reduce the production of non-feasible solution. The result of calculation example shows that NGA is feasible and efficient for daily commitment optimization and its convergence performance is better than GA, with a broad search space and fast convergence and good solution quality.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 Aug. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5583522/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11554514","isConference":true,"volume":"5","htmlLink":"/document/5583522/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"23 September 2010","conferenceDate":"10-12 Aug. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"New genetic algorithm for hydropower plants unit commitment optimization","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"New genetic algorithm for hydropower plants unit commitment optimization","confLoc":"Yantai, China","sourcePdf":"522.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047117S","chronDate":"10-12 Aug. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5564900","isNumber":"5582346","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5564900","xplore-issue":"5582346","articleId":"5583522","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5583525,"authors":[{"name":"Xinjie Wu","affiliation":["College of Physics, Liaoning University, Shenyang, China"],"firstName":"Xinjie","lastName":"Wu","id":"37678189200"},{"name":"Chao Xu","affiliation":["College of Physics, Liaoning University, Shenyang, China"],"firstName":"Chao","lastName":"Xu","id":"37674596400"},{"name":"Rongrong Fu","affiliation":["College of Physics, Liaoning University, Shenyang, China"],"firstName":"Rongrong","lastName":"Fu","id":"38194543800"},{"name":"Chengdong Wu","affiliation":["School of Information Science & Engineering, Northeastern University, Shenyang, China"],"firstName":"Chengdong","lastName":"Wu","id":"37290270000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5961-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5958-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5959-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-9555"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-9563"}],"articleNumber":"5583525","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":75},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Immune system","Blind source separation","Signal processing algorithms","Mathematical model","Mutual information","Polynomials"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["blind source separation","nonlinear functions","polynomials"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["immune clonal algorithm","mutual information","nonlinear blind source separation","global optimal solutions","local optimal solutions","odd polynomial function","nonlinear mixed function","nonlinear mixed signals"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["nonlinear mixture","blind source separation","immune clonal algorithm","mutual information"]}],"abstract":"In nonlinear blind source separation (NBSS), usually it is very difficulty to find the global optimal solutions of cost functions due to the existence of many local optimal solutions.

A novel method based on curvelet transform and support vector machine (SVM) is designed to recognize facial expression. Face recognition experiments with Yale database and facial expression recognition experiments with JAFFE database are carried out. The correct recognition rates are 93.33% and 94.73% respectively in \u201ccombined curvelet + SVM face recognition\u201d and \u201ccurvelet + SVM facial expression recognition\u201d.

Failure diagnosis of bearing faults is necessary and can often avoid more catastrophic failure consequences. Nowadays vibration condition monitoring is the most frequently used failure diagnostic method for rotating machinery. Several designs have been proposed in the literature and in this paper we propose a different approach using a radial basis function (RBF) neural network (NN) trained with extended minimum resource allocating network (EMRAN) algorithms, for pattern classification of 4 types of bearing health conditions: healthy, inner race, outer race and ball bearing faults. The input nodes of the NN consist of five features extracted from the time domain vibration data: peak, root mean square, standard deviation, kurtosis and normal negative log-likelihood value. Furthermore the NN is analyzed in terms of sensitivity to the different input features in order to remove significant and/or redundant inputs. The accuracy of the pattern classification technique is compared for both longitudinal and vertical accelerations. Using real experimental data from a machine fault simulator it was found that the EMRAN RBF NN requires only a few features and classifies the 4 types of bearing faults with good accuracy. The effectiveness of the approach proposed in this paper has illustrated its feasibility for real time condition monitoring of rotating machinery.","doi":"10.1109/ICNC.2010.5583833","pdfPath":"/iel5/5564900/5582888/05583833.pdf","startPage":"287","endPage":"291","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 Sixth International Conference on Natural Computation","publicationTitle":"2010 Sixth International Conference on Natural Computation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNC.2010.5583833","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5582888","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fault diagnosis of rolling element bearings using an EMRAN RBF neural network- demonstrated using real experimental data","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5583833/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 Aug. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Fault diagnosis of rolling element bearings using an EMRAN RBF neural network- demonstrated using real experimental data","isConference":true,"volume":"1","dateOfInsertion":"23 September 2010","accessionNumber":"11555076","publicationDate":"Aug. 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5583833/","conferenceDate":"10-12 Aug. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fault diagnosis of rolling element bearings using an EMRAN RBF neural network- demonstrated using real experimental data","confLoc":"Yantai, China","sourcePdf":"64.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060179S","chronDate":"10-12 Aug. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5564900","isNumber":"5582888","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5564900","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5582888","articleId":"5583833","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":5583838,"authors":[{"name":"Lixian Liu","affiliation":["Department Electrical & Electronics Engineering, Shijiazhuang Railway Institute, Shijiazhuang, China"],"firstName":"Lixian","lastName":"Liu","id":"37859136700"},{"name":"Bingxin Han","affiliation":["Department Electrical & Electronics Engineering, Shijiazhuang Railway Institute, Shijiazhuang, China"],"firstName":"Bingxin","lastName":"Han","id":"37857206300"},{"name":"Xiaobing Ren","affiliation":["Department Electrical & Electronics Engineering, Shijiazhuang Railway Institute, Shijiazhuang, China"],"firstName":"Xiaobing","lastName":"Ren","id":"38193397200"},{"name":"Zhanfeng Gao","affiliation":["Engineering Training Center, Shijiazhuang Railway Institute, Shijiazhuang, China"],"firstName":"Zhanfeng","lastName":"Gao","id":"37833366300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5961-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5958-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5959-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-9555"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-9563"}],"articleNumber":"5583838","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":840},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5583838","abstract":"Most research and application of recursive neural network is mostly the unit feedback recursive neural network, the dynamic process of the system is usually determined by the dynamic feedback, so it is difficult to control the dynamic process, which limits application.

However, there is also a need for developing techniques to identify general content-preserved manipulations, which are employed to conceal tampering trails frequently. In this paper, we propose a blind forensic algorithm to detect median filtering (MF), which is applied extensively for signal denoising and digital image enhancement. The probability of zero values on the first order difference map in texture regions can serve as MF statistical fingerprint, which distinguishes MF from other operations. Since anti-forensic techniques enjoy utilizing MF to attack the linearity assumption of existing forensics algorithms, blind detection of the non-linear MF becomes especially significant. Both theoretically reasoning and experimental results verify the effectiveness of our proposed MF forensics scheme.","doi":"10.1109/ICME.2010.5583869","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Multimedia and Expo","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Multimedia and Expo","pdfPath":"/iel5/5570012/5582530/05583869.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICME.2010.5583869","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5582530","startPage":"89","endPage":"94","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Forensic detection of median filtering in digital images","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5583869","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Forensic detection of median filtering in digital images","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-23 July 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5583869/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"19-23 July 2010","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2010","accessionNumber":"11555222","dateOfInsertion":"23 September 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5583869/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Forensic detection of median filtering in digital images","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"P1804.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058286S","chronDate":"19-23 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5570012","isNumber":"5582530","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5570012","citationCount":"76","xplore-issue":"5582530","articleId":"5583869","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-22"},{"_id":5583886,"authors":[{"name":"Fl\u00e1vio Ribeiro","affiliation":["Electronic Systems Eng.

Common to all published research is the observation that the accuracy of SSL degrades with reverberation. Indeed, early (strong) reflections can have amplitudes similar to the direct signal, and will often interfere with the estimation. In this paper, we show that reverberation is not the enemy, and can be used to improve estimation. More specifically, we are able to use early reflections to significantly improve range and elevation estimation. The process requires two steps: during setup, a loudspeaker integrated with the array emits a probing sound, which is used to obtain estimates of the ceiling height, as well as the locations of the walls. In a second step (e.g., during a meeting), the device incorporates this knowledge into a maximum likelihood SSL algorithm. Experimental results on both real and synthetic data show huge improvements in range estimation accuracy.","doi":"10.1109/ICME.2010.5583886","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Multimedia and Expo","pdfPath":"/iel5/5570012/5582530/05583886.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5582530","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICME.2010.5583886","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Multimedia and Expo","startPage":"731","endPage":"736","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Turning enemies into friends: Using reflections to improve sound source localization","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5583886","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-23 July 2010","displayDocTitle":"Turning enemies into friends: Using reflections to improve sound source localization","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5583886/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5583886/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2010","accessionNumber":"11555233","dateOfInsertion":"23 September 2010","conferenceDate":"19-23 July 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Turning enemies into friends: Using reflections to improve sound source localization","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"P1865.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05433S","chronDate":"19-23 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5570012","isNumber":"5582530","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5570012","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"5582530","articleId":"5583886","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5583889,"authors":[{"name":"Dong Zhao","affiliation":["Beijing Key Laboratory of Intelligent Telecommunications Software and Multimedia, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Dong","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37713302400"},{"name":"Huadong Ma","affiliation":["Beijing Key Laboratory of Intelligent Telecommunications Software and Multimedia, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Huadong","lastName":"Ma","id":"37277689100"},{"name":"Liang Liu","affiliation":["Beijing Key Laboratory of Intelligent Telecommunications Software and Multimedia, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Liang","lastName":"Liu","id":"37311090000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7493-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7491-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-7492-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1945-788X"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1945-7871"},{"format":"CD","value":"1945-7871"}],"articleNumber":"5583889","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":333},"abstract":"The audio surveillance is traditionally performed by using wired microphones.

A distance based decision fusion is used to combine the sensory information collected by the audio sensors.

In MCP enabled systems, the Base Stations (BSs) of the network form groups that jointly process user signals in order to reduce inter-cell interference and boost performance. Although MCP can lead to significant gains, it is also accompanied by overheads that are proportional to the number of BSs that are grouped together, called the cluster size. Thus it is crucial that BS clusters are of a limited size and formed in an intelligent way for achieving high performance. In this paper we present different dynamic clustering approaches for forming BS clusters of limited size. BS clustering is no longer based on geographical criteria, e.g. proximity-based static clustering, but on the channel conditions that users experience to different BSs. Dynamic clustering algorithms capture the effect of changing channel conditions and thus exploit the inherent macrodiversity of multicell wireless systems. More specifically, we propose a dynamic clustering scheme that provides significant gains while being resilient to inaccurate information on the state of wireless channels.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The value of dynamic clustering of base stations for future wireless networks","publicationTitle":"International Conference on Fuzzy Systems","doi":"10.1109/FUZZY.2010.5583933","displayPublicationTitle":"International Conference on Fuzzy Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5573642/5583929/05583933.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FUZZY.2010.5583933","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5583929","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5583933","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5583933/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-23 July 2010","displayDocTitle":"The value of dynamic clustering of base stations for future wireless networks","conferenceDate":"18-23 July 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5583933/","dateOfInsertion":"23 September 2010","publicationDate":"July 2010","accessionNumber":"11567226","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The value of dynamic clustering of base stations for future wireless networks","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"F0310.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062792S","chronDate":"18-23 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5573642","isNumber":"5583929","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5573642","citationCount":"44","xplore-issue":"5583929","articleId":"5583933","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5584017,"authors":[{"name":"Zhimin Liu","affiliation":["Geomatics College, Shandong University of Science and Technology, Qingdao, Shandong, China"],"firstName":"Zhimin","lastName":"Liu","id":"37593001500"},{"name":"Weidong Xiong","affiliation":["Economic and Technological Development Zone, Survey mapping and planning office, Qingdao, Shandong, China"],"firstName":"Weidong","lastName":"Xiong","id":"38194626900"},{"name":"Zhizhong Kang","affiliation":["Geomatics College, Shandong University of Science and Technology, Qingdao, Shandong, China"],"firstName":"Zhizhong","lastName":"Kang","id":"38192537900"},{"name":"Huizhan Zhang","affiliation":["Geomatics College, Shandong University of Science and Technology, Qingdao, Shandong, China"],"firstName":"Huizhan","lastName":"Zhang","id":"38195675500"},{"name":"Meng Qu","affiliation":["Geomatics College, Shandong University of Science and Technology, Qingdao, Shandong, China"],"firstName":"Meng","lastName":"Qu","id":"38192583700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5961-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5958-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5959-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-9555"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-9563"}],"articleNumber":"5584017","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":204},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Global Positioning System","Algorithm design and analysis","Genetics","Mathematical model","Estimation","Optimization","Equations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","Global Positioning System","least squares approximations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["GPS ambiguity resolution","single epoch data","genetic algorithms","correct integer values","carrier phase observables","control parameters","non-Linear least-square principle"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["GPS Ambiguity Resolution","Genetic Algorithms","Non-Linear Least-square Principle","single epoch positioning"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5584017","abstract":"The ambiguities resolved to their correct integer values are very important for the high accuracy of the double-differenced Global Positioning System (GPS) carrier phase observables.

Nowadays, they are assembled with no dimensional control, obtaining a final product with high physical deviations. Since the car manufacturer is requiring more and more precision, the number of faulty headlamps is increasing, and thus the cost to the headlamp producer. To solve this problem, a new automatic assembly machine was built. It integrated different technologies such as sensor systems, linear actuators and computational capacities. This work presents the conception, design and development of a fuzzy control algorithm for an automatic machine capable of correcting the dimensional tolerances of vehicle headlamps during its assembly process. Particulary, this paper describes the problem of modeling and control an industrial system, with a high complex dynamics and unknown model, by a rule-based model constructed from measured data. To validate the proposed control system, different experimental tests were carried out in both the lab and the assembly line in the factory.

The Taguchi method is an experimental design method, which is inserted between the crossover and the mutation operations of a GA to enhance the genetic algorithm so that better potential offspring can be generated. The TGA searches for the best feature set using principles of evolutionary process, after which these optimal features are then passed to the FSVM to calculate classification accuracy.

When the structure is failed, the distribution of bispectrum will be changed. bispectrum entropy can reflect this change and achieve good separation of the different types of fault. In this paper, the vibration signal in different states of a secondary drive gearbox is compared and analyzed, bispectrum and bispectrum entropy are extracted.

A sampled-data output-feedback polynomial fuzzy controller is proposed to control the nonlinear plant represented by the polynomial fuzzy model. The proposed sampled-data output-feedback polynomial fuzzy controller makes use of the system output for control. Furthermore, due to the sampling activity, the control signal will be kept constant during the sampling period which complicates the system dynamics and makes the stability analysis difficult. The system stability is investigated based on the Lyapunov stability theory using the sum-of-squares (SOS) approach. SOS-based stability conditions are derived to guarantee the system stability and aid the stable design of the sampled-data output-feedback polynomial fuzzy controller. With the third-party Matlab toolbox SOSTOOLS, the solution to the SOS-based stability conditions can be found numerically. A simulation example is given to demonstrate the merits of the proposed control approach.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Polynomials","Stability analysis","Control systems","Numerical stability","Mathematical model","Thermal stability","Lyapunov method"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["control system synthesis","feedback","fuzzy control","Lyapunov methods","nonlinear control systems","polynomials","sampled data systems","stability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["stability analysis","sampled-data output-feedback polynomial fuzzy-model-based control system","nonlinear plant","system output","sampling activity","control signal","sampling period","system dynamics","Lyapunov stability theory","sum-of-squares","SOS-based stability condition","system stability","controller design","third-party Matlab toolbox SOSTOOLS"]}],"doi":"10.1109/FUZZY.2010.5584181","publicationTitle":"International Conference on Fuzzy Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"International Conference on Fuzzy Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5573642/5583929/05584181.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5583929","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FUZZY.2010.5584181","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Stability analysis of sampled-data output-feedback polynomial fuzzy-model-based control systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5584181","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Stability analysis of sampled-data output-feedback polynomial fuzzy-model-based control systems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5584181/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5584181/","accessionNumber":"11567407","conferenceDate":"18-23 July 2010","dateOfInsertion":"23 September 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-23 July 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Stability analysis of sampled-data output-feedback polynomial fuzzy-model-based control systems","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"F0174.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06689S","chronDate":"18-23 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5573642","isNumber":"5583929","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5573642","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5583929","articleId":"5584181","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5584194,"authors":[{"name":"Linze Wang","affiliation":["Institute of Computer Application Technology, HangZhou DianZi University, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Linze","lastName":"Wang","id":"37280763800"},{"name":"Ziming Li","affiliation":["Institute of Computer Application Technology, HangZhou DianZi University, Hangzhou, China"],"lastName":"Ziming Li","id":"37087630868"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5961-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5958-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5959-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-9555"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-9563"}],"articleNumber":"5584194","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":87},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Frequency measurement","Force","Noise","Chaos","Signal detection","Oscillators","Noise measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frequency measurement","genetic algorithms","signal detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frequency measurement","weak sinusoidal signal","genetic algorithm","optimal theory","modified ADVP model"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["measurement frequency","weak sinusoidal signal","genetic algorith","chaotic oscillator","detection"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5584194","abstract":"Improving the method of measurement frequency based on the optimal theory when applying it to measuring the weak sinusoidal signal frequency based on the modified ADVP model.

In this paper, a technique of diagnosing target systems is proposed by using a fuzzified neural network which is trained with time-series data with reliability grades recorded by the sensor system which has already existed. Reliability grades are beforehand given to the recorded data by domain experts. The state of a target system is determined based on the fuzzy output value from the trained fuzzified neural network. Our proposed technique makes us determine easily the state of the target systems. Our proposed technique is flexibly applicable to various types of systems by considering some parameters for failure determination of target systems.","doi":"10.1109/FUZZY.2010.5584318","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","displayPublicationTitle":"International Conference on Fuzzy Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5573642/5583929/05584318.pdf","publicationTitle":"International Conference on Fuzzy Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FUZZY.2010.5584318","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5583929","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Development of a fault diagnosis system based on fuzzified neural networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Artificial neural networks","Valves","Chemicals","Fault diagnosis","Sensors","Chemical sensors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["chemical industry","condition monitoring","fault diagnosis","fuzzy neural nets","reliability theory","time series"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fault diagnosis system","fuzzified neural network","condition monitoring","time-series data","reliability grade","circulatory systems","chemical plants"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5584318/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-23 July 2010","displayDocTitle":"Development of a fault diagnosis system based on fuzzified neural networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5584318/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2010","dateOfInsertion":"23 September 2010","conferenceDate":"18-23 July 2010","accessionNumber":"11567254","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Development of a fault diagnosis system based on fuzzified neural networks","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"F0364.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067299S","chronDate":"18-23 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5573642","isNumber":"5583929","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5573642","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5583929","articleId":"5584318","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5584323,"authors":[{"name":"Zhiqiang Liu","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Machine Perception, School of Electronics Engineering and Computer Science, Ministry of Education, Peking University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zhiqiang","lastName":"Liu","id":"38194522500"},{"name":"Hongyan Li","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Machine Perception, School of Electronics Engineering and Computer Science, Ministry of Education, Peking University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Hongyan","lastName":"Li","id":"37423713600"},{"name":"Gaoshan Miao","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Machine Perception, School of Electronics Engineering and Computer Science, Ministry of Education, Peking University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Gaoshan","lastName":"Miao","id":"37664010100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5961-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5958-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5959-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-9555"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-9563"}],"articleNumber":"5584323","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":30,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1362},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5584323","abstract":"Large scale mobile data are generated continuously by multiple mobile devices in daily communications. Classification on such data possesses high significance for analyzing the behaviors of mobile customers. However, the natural properties of mobile data presents three non-trivial challenges: large data scale leads it difficult to keep both efficiency and accuracy; similar data increases the system load; and noise in the data set is also an important influence factor of the processing result. To resolve the above problems, this paper integrates conventional backpropagation neural network in the cloud computing environment. A MapReduce-based method called MBNN (i.e. MapReduce-based Backpropagation Neural Network) is proposed to process classifications on large-scale mobile data. It utilizes a diversity-based algorithm to decrease the computational loads. Moreover, the Adaboosting mechanism is introduced to further ameliorate the performance of classifications. Extensive experiments on gigabyte of realistic mobile data are performed on a cloud computing platform. And the results show that MBNN is characterized by superior efficiency, good scalability and anti-noise.","doi":"10.1109/ICNC.2010.5584323","startPage":"1726","endPage":"1730","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 Sixth International Conference on Natural Computation","pdfPath":"/iel5/5564900/5582329/05584323.pdf","publicationTitle":"2010 Sixth International Conference on Natural Computation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNC.2010.5584323","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5582329","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MapReduce-based Backpropagation Neural Network over large scale mobile data","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Mobile communication","Artificial neural networks","Training","Backpropagation","Cloud computing","Scalability","Classification algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["backpropagation","Internet","mobile computing","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mapreduce-based backpropagation neural network","large scale mobile data","mobile devices","mobile customer behavior","cloud computing environment","diversity-based algorithm","adaboosting mechanism"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MapReduce","large-scale data","Backpropagation neural network","Adaboosting"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5584323/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 Aug. 2010","displayDocTitle":"MapReduce-based Backpropagation Neural Network over large scale mobile data","isConference":true,"volume":"4","htmlLink":"/document/5584323/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"23 September 2010","conferenceDate":"10-12 Aug. 2010","accessionNumber":"11554393","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MapReduce-based Backpropagation Neural Network over large scale mobile data","confLoc":"Yantai, China","sourcePdf":"378.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073415S","chronDate":"10-12 Aug. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5564900","isNumber":"5582329","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5564900","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"5582329","articleId":"5584323","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5584347,"authors":[{"name":"Jian Deng","affiliation":["School of Business Administration, Changchun Taxation College, Changchun, China"],"firstName":"Jian","lastName":"Deng","id":"37600359900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5961-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5958-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5959-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-9555"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-9563"}],"articleNumber":"5584347","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":201},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Artificial neural networks","Biological system modeling","Data models","Predictive models","Economic indicators","Linear regression"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["backpropagation","energy consumption","multilayer perceptrons","power engineering computing","power system economics","regression analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["China electricity consumption","artificial neural network topology","multilayer perceptron","backpropagation training algorithm","tangent-sigmoid functions","pure-linear transfer functions","economic indicators","absolute mean square error","multiple linear regression model"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["china energy demand","artificial neural network","linear regression model"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5584347","abstract":"Artificial Neural Networks are proposed to model and predict electricity consumption of China.

Performance comparison among the ANN and multiple linear models is made based on absolute mean square error. The ANN model also has much better RMSE for the forecasted energy demands than multiple linear regressions. Energy demand of China is predicted until 2050 using data from 1990 to 2008 along with other economic indicators. The results show that energy demands would peak during 2026-2035 and decrease gradually. This decreasing trend of energy demand appears very unique because all independent variables are increasing.

However, the traditional GA is always subjected to the low convergence velocity and deceptions of multiple local optima. To overcome such inconvenience, a novel GA is proposed which entitled self-adaptive genetic algorithms (SaGA) in this paper. During the execution of the search process, the whole populations are classified into subgroups by sufficiently analyzed the individuals' state. Each individual in a different subset is assigned to the appropriate attribute (probabilities of crossover and mutation, p\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">c</sub>\n, p\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">m</sub>\n). Self-adaptive update the subgroups and adjust the control parameters, which are considered to be an optimal balance between exploration and exploitation. The empirical values and negative feedback technique are also used in parameters selection, which relieve the burden of specifying the parameters values. The new method is tested on a set of well-known benchmark test functions, and the simulation results suggest that it outperforms to other state-of-the-art techniques referred to in this paper in terms of the quality of the final solutions.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 Aug. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5584437/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11554476","isConference":true,"volume":"5","htmlLink":"/document/5584437/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"23 September 2010","conferenceDate":"10-12 Aug. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A novel Genetic Algorithm with multiple sub-population parallel search mechanism","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel Genetic Algorithm with multiple sub-population parallel search mechanism","confLoc":"Yantai, China","sourcePdf":"491.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071159S","chronDate":"10-12 Aug. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5564900","isNumber":"5582346","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5564900","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5582346","articleId":"5584437","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":5584439,"authors":[{"name":"Taher M.

The method makes an easy way to control complex systems with an automatic low complicated design.

This type of fuzzy controller is made optimal by the use of hierarchical minimal association of input rule bases, learned fuzzy inferences and the configuration of aggregation processes. The proposed strategy of design with learned fuzzy rule bases guarantee an interpretable behavioral decomposition. The effect of the growth of fuzzy rules number in terms of the algorithmic complexity has been studied.

However, several studies have shown that the genetic algorithm (GA) performs more favorably. In this paper, a new crossover operator for clustering GA is proposed. It combines string-coded crossover operator and real-coded crossover operator. Results from a series of experiments on benchmark data are quite encouraging, including that the newly proposed crossover operator performs better than both string-coded crossover operator and two versions of real-coded crossover operators. The way of coefficient selection for the combination is presented.

Our results will be very useful in selecting the parameters of the membership functions to achieve a desired continuity (e.g., for most traditional modeling and control applications) or discontinuity (e.g., for hybrid and switched systems modeling and control).","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Examining the continuity of type-1 and interval type-2 fuzzy logic systems","publicationTitle":"International Conference on Fuzzy Systems","doi":"10.1109/FUZZY.2010.5584482","displayPublicationTitle":"International Conference on Fuzzy Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5573642/5583929/05584482.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FUZZY.2010.5584482","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5583929","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5584482","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5584482/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-23 July 2010","displayDocTitle":"Examining the continuity of type-1 and interval type-2 fuzzy logic systems","conferenceDate":"18-23 July 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5584482/","dateOfInsertion":"23 September 2010","publicationDate":"July 2010","accessionNumber":"11567448","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Examining the continuity of type-1 and interval type-2 fuzzy logic systems","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"F0040.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.235567S","chronDate":"18-23 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5573642","isNumber":"5583929","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5573642","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"5583929","articleId":"5584482","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5584492,"authors":[{"name":"Changhui Deng","affiliation":["School of Information Engineering, Dalian Fisheries University, Dalian, China"],"firstName":"Changhui","lastName":"Deng","id":"37275460400"},{"name":"Yanping Gao","affiliation":["School of Information Engineering, Dalian Fisheries University, Dalian, China"],"firstName":"Yanping","lastName":"Gao","id":"37597945100"},{"name":"Jun Gu","affiliation":["School of Information Engineering, Dalian Fisheries University, Dalian, China"],"firstName":"Jun","lastName":"Gu","id":"37308553100"},{"name":"Xinying Miao","affiliation":["School of Information Engineering, Dalian Fisheries University, Dalian, China"],"firstName":"Xinying","lastName":"Miao","id":"37587980800"},{"name":"Songsong Li","affiliation":["School of Information Engineering, Dalian Fisheries University, Dalian, China"],"lastName":"Songsong Li","id":"38195367100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5961-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5958-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5959-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-9555"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-9563"}],"articleNumber":"5584492","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":242},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5584492","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Aquaculture","Organisms","Artificial neural networks","Expert systems","Biological system modeling","Training"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["aquaculture","economics","expert systems","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["growth model","aquaculture organisms","aquaculture water","economic value","artificial neural network expert system","growing state model","water quality parameters","bottleneck problem"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["intensive aquaculture","artificial neural network","expert system","water quality parameters","growing state of aquaculture organisms"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICNC.2010.5584492","pdfPath":"/iel5/5564900/5582329/05584492.pdf","publicationTitle":"2010 Sixth International Conference on Natural Computation","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 Sixth International Conference on Natural Computation","startPage":"1812","endPage":"1815","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5582329","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNC.2010.5584492","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Research on the growth model of aquaculture organisms based on neural network expert system","abstract":"In intensive aquaculture, the growing state of aquaculture organisms is affected by many factors.

Prior work shows that the lack of precise time synchronization is a critical hindrance to reliable model generation or estimation in networked distributed systems. This paper explores the use of IEEE 1588 Precision Time Protocol (PTP) to improve the fidelity of model estimates and the reliability of control messaging. The implemented controller is tested on a control system testbed augmented with PTP based time stamping and shows substantially improved tracking performance when compared to a similar controller without precise time knowledge. This improvement was achieved by building a propagated estimation of the master system to provide a reference tracking signal for the slave system, a technique that would not be feasible without time synchronization.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5584532/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 Aug. 2010","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"21-24 Aug. 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5584532/","dateOfInsertion":"21 October 2010","publicationDate":"Aug. 2010","accessionNumber":"11555833","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A practical implementation of distributed system control over an asynchronous Ethernet network using time stamped data","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A practical implementation of distributed system control over an asynchronous Ethernet network using time stamped data","confLoc":"Toronto, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"0282.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050995S","chronDate":"21-24 Aug. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5570123","isNumber":"5583939","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5570123","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5583939","articleId":"5584532","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5584540,"authors":[{"name":"Libo Song","affiliation":["School of Business Administration, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Libo","lastName":"Song","id":"38194341600"},{"name":"Xuejun Xu","affiliation":["School of Business Administration, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Xuejun","lastName":"Xu","id":"38194842300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5961-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5958-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5959-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-9555"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-9563"}],"articleNumber":"5584540","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":289},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Schedules","Job shop scheduling","Biological cells","Chaotic communication","Search problems","Algorithm design and analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","job shop scheduling","search problems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["flexible job shop scheduling","genetic algorithm","chaotic local search","MAKESPAN criterion","logistic chaotic sequence"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Flexible job shop scheduling","Genetic algorithms","Chaotic Sequence","Chaotic Search"]}],"abstract":"Flexible job shop scheduling problem (FJSP) is a generalization of the classical job shop scheduling problem, and provides a closer approximation to real world scheduling situations.

classification using probabilistic neural networks","abstract":"Traffic classification, a branch of passive network measurement, becomes more and more important for network management. As traditional traffic classification techniques like port-based and payload-based techniques become ineffective for complicated internet applications which use dynamic port number and encryption techniques to avoid detection, machine learning based techniques gained more and more attentions in the past few years. But there are few studies that focus on applying neural computation techniques for traffic classification. In this paper, we use a distributed host based traffic collection platform (DHTCP) to gather traffic samples with accurate application information on user hosts. Then probabilistic neural network was used to traffic classification. Web and P2P traffics were studied since they are the most predominant internet traffic types. experimental results show that probabilistic neural network is an effective machine learning technique for traffic identification.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 Aug. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5584648/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11554359","isConference":true,"volume":"4","htmlLink":"/document/5584648/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"23 September 2010","conferenceDate":"10-12 Aug. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Traffic classification using probabilistic neural networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Traffic classification using probabilistic neural networks","confLoc":"Yantai","sourcePdf":"420.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.081756S","chronDate":"10-12 Aug. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5564900","isNumber":"5582329","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5564900","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"5582329","articleId":"5584648","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":5584660,"authors":[{"name":"Qingle Pang","affiliation":["School of Information and Electronic Engineering, Shandong Institute of Business and Technology, Yantai, China"],"firstName":"Qingle","lastName":"Pang","id":"37528872700"},{"name":"Xinyun Liu","affiliation":["School of Information and Electronic Engineering, Shandong Institute of Business and Technology, Yantai, China"],"firstName":"Xinyun","lastName":"Liu","id":"37835777200"},{"name":"Min Zhang","affiliation":["College of Computer Science, Liaocheng University, China"],"firstName":"Min","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37089055024"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5961-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5958-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5959-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-9555"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-9563"}],"articleNumber":"5584660","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":403},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5584660","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Forecasting","Artificial neural networks","Predictive models","Data models","Accuracy","Information processing","Transportation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automated highways","neural nets","rough set theory","traffic engineering computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["traffic flow forecasting model","rough set","forecasting accuracy","intelligent transportation systems","traffic flow deviation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Intelligent transportation systems","traffic flow forecasting","rough set","neural network"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICNC.2010.5584660","pdfPath":"/iel5/5564900/5582329/05584660.pdf","publicationTitle":"2010 Sixth International Conference on Natural Computation","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 Sixth International Conference on Natural Computation","startPage":"1920","endPage":"1924","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5582329","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNC.2010.5584660","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Traffic flow forecasting based on rough set and neural network","abstract":"As intelligent transportation systems (ITS) are implemented widely throughout the world, managers of transportation systems have access to large amounts of real-time status data. A variety of methods and techniques have been developed to forecast traffic flow. The traffic flow forecasting model based on neural network has been applied widely in ITS because of its high forecasting accuracy and self-learning ability. But the forecasting errors of the traffic flow curve near peaks are large, especially at the large slope difference on both side of the peak. As such, the traffic flow forecasting based on rough set and neural network is proposed. The traffic flow in the current time interval, traffic flow in the previous time interval, traffic flow deviation between the current time interval and the previous time interval and current time is regarded as an input of a neural network respectively. The forecasting traffic flow in the following time interval is the output of the neural network. The trained neural network is the traffic flow forecasting model based on neural network. Then, the forecasting traffic flow in the following time interval obtained by the neural network based traffic flow forecasting model is compensated by rough set to increase the forecasting accuracy. The simulation experiments show that the presented traffic flow forecasting based on rough set and neural network can improve the forecasting accuracy significantly.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components,

Quantum behaved PSO has been proved efficient compared with PSO. In this paper, three mutation operators including Gaussian, Chaotic, Cauchy and Levy combined with PSO are studied. And three mechanisms are adopted as approach for constraints which are H, J and P strategy. Turbulence operations are come up in PSO which improves the exploratory capabilities. Self-adaptive parameters are adopted in improved H strategy and constraints violates sum is used instead of minimum and maximum fitness values is brought up in improved P strategy, both of the two improved strategies achieved better performances compared with GA in optimizing benchmark functions.

Most algorithms that automatically develop a rule-based model are not well suited to deal with incomplete data. The usual technique is to disregard the missing values or substitute them by a best guess estimate, which can bias the results. In this paper we propose a new method for estimating the parameters of a Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy model in the presence of incomplete data. We also propose an inference mechanism that can deal with the incomplete data. The presented method has the added advantage that it does not require imputation or iterative guess-estimate of the missing values. This methodology is applied to fuzzy modeling of a classification and regression problem. The performance of the obtained models are comparable with the results obtained when using a complete data set.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5584894/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-23 July 2010","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"18-23 July 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5584894/","dateOfInsertion":"23 September 2010","publicationDate":"July 2010","accessionNumber":"11567098","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A new approach to dealing with missing values in data-driven fuzzy modeling","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new approach to dealing with missing values in data-driven fuzzy modeling","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"F0576.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.093127S","chronDate":"18-23 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5573642","isNumber":"5583929","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5573642","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"5583929","articleId":"5584894","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5584904,"authors":[{"name":"Chunman Yan","affiliation":["Institute of Intelligent Control and Image Engineering, Xidian University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Chunman","lastName":"Yan","id":"37894742900"},{"name":"Baolong Guo","affiliation":["Institute of Intelligent Control and Image Engineering, Xidian University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Baolong","lastName":"Guo","id":"37401775300"},{"name":"Meng Yi","affiliation":["Institute of Intelligent Control and Image Engineering, Xidian University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Meng","lastName":"Yi","id":"37894480500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5961-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5958-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5959-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-9555"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-9563"}],"articleNumber":"5584904","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":220},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Filter bank","Image reconstruction","Transforms","PSNR","Filtering theory","Frequency response"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel bank filters","image representation","optimisation","transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["directional filter bank","nonsubsampled contourlet transform","directional multiresolution image representation","human visual system"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["contourlet transform","directional filter banks (DFB)","nonsubsampled contourlet transform (NSCT)","optimization"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5584904","doi":"10.1109/ICNC.2010.5584904","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNC.2010.5584904","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5583481","publicationTitle":"2010 Sixth International Conference on Natural Computation","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 Sixth International Conference on Natural Computation","pdfPath":"/iel5/5564900/5583481/05584904.pdf","startPage":"4135","endPage":"4138","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimization for the directional filter bank of the nonsubsampled contourlet transform","abstract":"The contourlet Transform is an efficient directional multiresolution image representation, but it is not shift-invariant.

A predistortion method, based on alignment of the nonlinear characteristics between the first- and the second-stage amplifiers, has been proposed and analyzed in order to enhance the linearization aspects. The resistors in the active bias circuits of both the stages are optimized to achieve the best cancellation conditions for the third-order intermodulation components. The two-stage amplifier IC, which is based on an InGaP/GaAs hetero-junction bipolar transistor (HBT) technology, has been designed and implemented for the 900 MHz band. An output 1 dB compression point (P1dB) of 29.6 dBm, a maximum third-order output intercept point (OIP3) of as high as 48.7 dBm at a two-tone average output power of 21 dBm have been obtained while having a quiescent current of 375 mA and a single bias supply of 5.5 V.

A comparison of offset-cancellation techniques shows that neither chopping nor auto-zeroing is an ideal solution for general-purpose CFIAs, since chopping results in output ripple, and auto-zeroing is associated with increased low-frequency noise. The presented CFIA mitigates these unintended side effects through a combination of these techniques. A ping-pong auto-zeroed input stage with slow-settling offset-nulling loops is applied to limit the bandwidth of the increased noise to less than half of the auto-zeroing frequency. This noise is then modulated away from DC by chopping the input stage at half the auto-zeroing frequency, reducing the low-frequency noise to the 27 nV/ white-noise level, without introducing extra output ripple. The auto-zeroing is augmented with settling phases to further reduce output transients. The CFIA was realized in a 0.5 \u03bcm analog CMOS process and achieves a typical offset of 2.8 \u03bcV and a CMRR of 140 dB in a common-mode voltage range that includes the negative supply.","doi":"10.1109/JSSC.2010.2060253","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSSC.2010.2060253","startPage":"2044","endPage":"2056","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel5/4/5584926/05584958.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5584926","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 140 dB-CMRR Current-Feedback Instrumentation Amplifier Employing Ping-Pong Auto-Zeroing and Chopping","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5584958/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 September 2010","displayDocTitle":"A 140 dB-CMRR Current-Feedback Instrumentation Amplifier Employing Ping-Pong Auto-Zeroing and Chopping","volume":"45","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"23 September 2010","accessionNumber":"11535257","publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5584958/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 140 dB-CMRR Current-Feedback Instrumentation Amplifier Employing Ping-Pong Auto-Zeroing and Chopping","sourcePdf":"jssc-pertijs-2060253-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.052805S","chronDate":"Oct.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"4","isNumber":"5584926","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"73","xplore-issue":"5584926","articleId":"5584958","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5584961,"authors":[{"name":"Ki-Tae Park","affiliation":["Flash Product and Technology Division, Memory Business, Samsung Electronics Company Limited, Hwasung, Gyeonggi, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/5584926/5584961/5584961-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ki-Tae Park received the B.S. degree in electronics engineering from Kyoungbook National University, Korea, in 1993, and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in machine intelligence and system engineering from Tohoku University, Japan, in 1993 and 1999, respectively.","From 1999 to 2001, he was a Research Associate and worked on nano-CMOS devices, low-power circuits, three-dimensional shared memories and artificial retina chips at Tohoku University.

Simple two-step dynamic Vpass control technique is used and over 40% program failure reduction after 30 k P/E cycling is achieved in the proposed scheme, compared to conventional method. A major pattern dependency of program disturbance in MLC NAND flash is also described in this paper. In order to achieve high immunity for the data pattern dependency in program disturbance, optimizing erase Vth and its distribution using ISPP-after-erase with a precise negative Vth sensing scheme are proposed. The proposed schemes are demonstrated using 42 nm MLC NAND flash test chip and about 2 times better Vpass window margin is obtained compared to conventional scheme.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5584961/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 September 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2010","dateOfInsertion":"23 September 2010","publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11535266","htmlLink":"/document/5584961/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"45","issue":"10","isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic Vpass Controlled Program Scheme and Optimized Erase Vth Control for High Program Inhibition in MLC NAND Flash Memories","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic Vpass Controlled Program Scheme and Optimized Erase Vth Control for High Program Inhibition in MLC NAND Flash Memories","sourcePdf":"jssc-park-2062311-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.057037S","chronDate":"Oct.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"4","isNumber":"5584926","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5584926","articleId":"5584961","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5584962,"authors":[{"name":"Bob Verbruggen","affiliation":["SSET/WL IMEC, Leuven, Belgium","department ETRO, Vrije Universiteit Brussel, Belgium"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/5584926/5584962/5584962-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Bob Verbruggen (S'07\u2013M'09) received the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from the Vrije Universiteit Brussel, Belgium, in 2005 and 2010, respectively.

However, NAND-ROM suffers from code-dependent read noises and cannot survive at low supply voltages (VDDs). These code-dependent read noises are primarily due to the charge-sharing effect, bitline leakage current, and crosstalk between bitlines, which become worse at lower VDD. This study proposes a dynamic split source-line (DSSL) scheme for NAND-ROM. The proposed scheme overcomes code-dependent read noises while improving the read access time and suppressing the active-mode gate leakage current, with only a 1% area penalty in the cell array. Experiments on a fabricated 256 Kb macro using a 90 nm industrial logic process demonstrate that the proposed DSSL scheme achieves 100% code-pattern coverage under a small sensing margin. Additionally, the DSSL NAND-ROM works with a wide range of supply voltages (1-0.31 V) with a 38%, 45.8%, and 37% improvement in speed, power, and standby current, respectively, at VDD = 1 V.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSSC.2010.2060279","doi":"10.1109/JSSC.2010.2060279","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel5/4/5584926/05584963.pdf","startPage":"2142","endPage":"2155","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5584926","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Noise-Immune Embedded NAND-ROM Using a Dynamic Split Source-Line Scheme for VDDmin and Speed Improvements","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Noise-Immune Embedded NAND-ROM Using a Dynamic Split Source-Line Scheme for VDDmin and Speed Improvements","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5584963/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2010","isJournal":true,"volume":"45","issue":"10","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11535270","dateOfInsertion":"23 September 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5584963/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 September 2010","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Noise-Immune Embedded NAND-ROM Using a Dynamic Split Source-Line Scheme for VDDmin and Speed Improvements","sourcePdf":"jssc-chang-2060279-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.100519S","chronDate":"Oct.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"4","isNumber":"5584926","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"5584926","articleId":"5584963","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5584964,"authors":[{"name":"Jonathan Borremans","affiliation":["IMEC, Leuven, Belgium"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/5584926/5584964/5584964-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jonathan Borremans (S'06\u2013M'08) received the M.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from the Vrije Universiteit Brussel, Brussels, Belgium, in 2004 and 2008, respectively, in collaboration with IMEC, Belgium.","He joined IMEC's wireless group, where his research interests are analog, mixed-signal and RF circuit design for multi-standard radios and millimeter-wave applications, in advanced CMOS technologies, as well as integrated MEMS-based systems and components."]},"firstName":"Jonathan","lastName":"Borremans","id":"37293802900"},{"name":"Kameswaran Vengattaramane","affiliation":["IMEC, Leuven, Belgium","Department ESAT, Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Leuven, Belgium"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/5584926/5584964/5584964-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Kameswaran Vengattaramane (S'02) received the B.E (E.E.) degree from Bangalore University, India, in 2002, and the M.S.

An enterprise solid-state drive (SSD) for a data center is a future promising market of NAND flash memories. The critical problem for such an enterprise SSD is a slow random write. The write unit in a NAND flash memory is a page, 4-8 KBytes. Because the minimum write unit of the operating system is a sector, 512 Bytes, a random write to write a smaller data than a page size frequently happens, which creates a garbage. As a garbage accumulates, a garbage collection is performed to increase a workable memory capacity. The garbage collection takes as much as 100 ms, which is 100 times longer than a page program time, 800 \u03bcs, and thus causes a serious performance degradation. In the proposed Fe-NAND flash memory, the data fragmentation in a random write is removed by introducing a batch write algorithm where a page buffer in the Fe-NAND flash memory temporarily stores a program data. The memory cell program starts after the program data as much as the page size accumulates in page buffers. As the data fragmentation is eliminated, the SSD performance can double. In addition, the nonvolatile page buffer realizes a power-outage-immune highly reliable operation. With a low program/erase voltage of 6 V and a high endurance of 100 million cycles, the proposed Fe-NAND flash memory is most suitable for a highly reliable highspeed low-power data-center-application enterprise SSD.","doi":"10.1109/JSSC.2010.2061650","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel5/4/5584926/05584966.pdf","startPage":"2156","endPage":"2164","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSSC.2010.2061650","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5584926","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Ferroelectric (Fe)-NAND Flash Memory With Batch Write Algorithm and Smart Data Store to the Nonvolatile Page Buffer for Data Center Application High-Speed and Highly Reliable Enterprise Solid-State Drives","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 September 2010","displayDocTitle":"Ferroelectric (Fe)-NAND Flash Memory With Batch Write Algorithm and Smart Data Store to the Nonvolatile Page Buffer for Data Center Application High-Speed and Highly Reliable Enterprise Solid-State Drives","volume":"45","issue":"10","dateOfInsertion":"23 September 2010","accessionNumber":"11535261","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5584966/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5584966/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ferroelectric (Fe)-NAND Flash Memory With Batch Write Algorithm and Smart Data Store to the Nonvolatile Page Buffer for Data Center Application High-Speed and Highly Reliable Enterprise Solid-State Drives","sourcePdf":"jssc-hatanaka-2061650-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.127225S","chronDate":"Oct.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"4","isNumber":"5584926","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"5584926","articleId":"5584966","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5584968,"authors":[{"name":"Ockgoo Lee","affiliation":["Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA","Qualcomm, San Diego, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/5584926/5584968/5584968-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ockgoo Lee (S'05) received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from Sungkyunkwan University in 2001, and the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from Korea Advanced Institute of Technology (KAIST), Daejeon, Korea, in 2005, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical and computer engineering at Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, in 2009.","In the spring and summer of 2008, he was an intern with Qualcomm.

However, it causes a power loss due to the slow transition of a common-gate device from the triode region to the cut-off region. To minimize the power loss of cascode class-E CMOS PAs, we propose a charging acceleration technique, CAT. This method incorporates a capacitive element between the drain and the source of a common-gate device in a cascode configuration, accelerating the charging speed responsible for turning off a common-gate device instantly after a common-source device is turned off and thus minimizing power loss from the device. We compared the performance of the proposed cascode class-E PA to that of the conventional cascode class-E PA using a 0.18- CMOS process. With a 3.3-V power supply, the proposed fully-integrated CMOS PA achieves 30.7 dBm of maximum output power and 45.6% of power-added efficiency (PAE) with a dynamic range of 40 dB at 1.6 GHz. According to measurements, the proposed cascode class-E PA shows improvement in PAE over the conventional class-E PA of between 5% and 9% in a 1.5 to 2.0 GHz range.","doi":"10.1109/JSSC.2010.2060257","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel5/4/5584926/05584968.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSSC.2010.2060257","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5584926","startPage":"2184","endPage":"2197","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Charging Acceleration Technique for Highly Efficient Cascode Class-E CMOS Power Amplifiers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5584968","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Charging Acceleration Technique for Highly Efficient Cascode Class-E CMOS Power Amplifiers","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5584968/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 September 2010","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"45","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11535264","dateOfInsertion":"23 September 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5584968/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Charging Acceleration Technique for Highly Efficient Cascode Class-E CMOS Power Amplifiers","sourcePdf":"jssc-lee-2060257-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.123837S","chronDate":"Oct.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"4","isNumber":"5584926","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"5584926","articleId":"5584968","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5584969,"authors":[{"name":"Chi Ho Law","affiliation":["Exar Corporation, Fremont, CA, USA","University of California, Davis, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Chi Ho","lastName":"Law","id":"38195410200"},{"name":"Paul J.

Rolling shutter has traditionally been considered as a disadvantage to image quality since it often introduces skew artifact. In this paper, we show that by controlling the readout timing and the exposure length for each row, the row-wise exposure discrepancy in rolling shutter can be exploited to flexibly sample the 3D space-time volume of scene appearance, and can thus be advantageous for computational photography. The required controls can be readily implemented in standard CMOS sensors by altering the logic of the control unit. We propose several coding schemes and applications: (1) coded readout allows us to better sample time dimension for high-speed photography and optical flow based applications; and (2) row-wise control enables capturing motion-blur free high dynamic range images from a single shot. While a prototype chip is currently in development, we demonstrate the benefits of coded rolling shutter via simulation using images of real scenes.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Coded rolling shutter photography: Flexible space-time sampling","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Computational Photography (ICCP)","doi":"10.1109/ICCPHOT.2010.5585094","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Computational Photography (ICCP)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5551847/5585087/05585094.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCPHOT.2010.5585094","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5585087","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5585094","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5585094/","chronOrPublicationDate":"29-30 March 2010","displayDocTitle":"Coded rolling shutter photography: Flexible space-time sampling","conferenceDate":"29-30 March 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5585094/","dateOfInsertion":"23 September 2010","publicationDate":"March 2010","accessionNumber":"11553751","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Coded rolling shutter photography: Flexible space-time sampling","confLoc":"Cambridge, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"origresearch07.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078847S","chronDate":"29-30 March 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5551847","isNumber":"5585087","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5551847","citationCount":"55","xplore-issue":"5585087","articleId":"5585094","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5585097,"authors":[{"name":"Yoav HaCohen","affiliation":["Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Israel"],"firstName":"Yoav","lastName":"HaCohen","id":"38193733300"},{"name":"Raanan Fattal","affiliation":["Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Israel"],"firstName":"Raanan","lastName":"Fattal","id":"37728395400"},{"name":"Dani Lischinski","affiliation":["Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Israel"],"firstName":"Dani","lastName":"Lischinski","id":"37418740700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7023-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7022-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-7021-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5585097","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":54,"citationCountPatent":9,"totalDownloads":595},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image segmentation","Image edge detection","Pixel","Databases","Image resolution","Image color analysis","Interpolation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image resolution","image sampling","image texture"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image upsampling","texture hallucination","sharpness","salient edges","image analysis","image synthesis","patch-based image model"]}],"abstract":"Image upsampling is a common yet challenging task, since it is severely underconstrained. While considerable progress was made in preserving the sharpness of salient edges, current methods fail to reproduce the fine detail typically present in the textured regions bounded by these edges, resulting in unrealistic appearance. In this paper we address this fundamental shortcoming by integrating higher-level image analysis and custom low-level image synthesis. Our approach extends and refines the patch-based image model of Freeman et al. and interprets the image as a tiling of distinct textures, each of which is matched to an example in a database of relevant textures. The matching is not done at the patch level, but rather collectively, over entire segments. Following this model fitting stage, which requires some user guidance, a higher-resolution image is synthesized using a hybrid approach that incorporates principles from example-based texture synthesis. We show that for images that comply with our model, our method is able to reintroduce consistent fine-scale detail, resulting in enhanced appearance textured regions.","doi":"10.1109/ICCPHOT.2010.5585097","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Computational Photography (ICCP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Computational Photography (ICCP)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5551847/5585087/05585097.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCPHOT.2010.5585097","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5585087","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Image upsampling via texture hallucination","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5585097","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"29-30 March 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5585097/","displayDocTitle":"Image upsampling via texture hallucination","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2010","accessionNumber":"11553754","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5585097/","conferenceDate":"29-30 March 2010","dateOfInsertion":"23 September 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Image upsampling via texture hallucination","confLoc":"Cambridge, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"origresearch06.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.094716S","chronDate":"29-30 March 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5551847","isNumber":"5585087","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5551847","citationCount":"54","xplore-issue":"5585087","articleId":"5585097","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5585123,"authors":[{"name":"Di Zhou","affiliation":["Department of Information Technology, Jiangnan University, Wuxi, Jiangsu, China"],"lastName":"Di Zhou","id":"37427981000"},{"name":"Jun Sun","affiliation":["Department of Information Technology, Jiangnan University, Wuxi, Jiangsu, China"],"lastName":"Jun Sun","id":"37087143433"},{"name":"Wenbo Xu","affiliation":["Department of Information Technology, Jiangnan University, Wuxi, Jiangsu, China"],"lastName":"Wenbo Xu","id":"37087182075"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6337-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6334-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6336-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5585123","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":113},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Mathematical model","Equations","Optimization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["particle swarm optimisation","quantum computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization","cooperative strategy","CQPSO","distribution algorithm estimation","EDA","standard particle swarm optimization algorithm","SPSO","communication frequency"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5585123","abstract":"In this paper, Quantum-behaved Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm (QPSO) is investigated from the perspective of Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (EDAs) for the first time, which proves that QPSO is a combination of EDA and Standard Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm (SPSO).

Neuron output feedback coefficient implies the dynamic evolution performance of the neural network. And different feedback coefficients express the dynamic performance of different neurons. Therefore, the Study for dynamic characteristics and learning strategies of output feedback neural network is of great theoretical significance and application value.","doi":"10.1109/IWACI.2010.5585172","startPage":"21","endPage":"25","displayPublicationTitle":"Third International Workshop on Advanced Computational Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel5/5573998/5585103/05585172.pdf","publicationTitle":"Third International Workshop on Advanced Computational Intelligence","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IWACI.2010.5585172","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5585103","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A neural network structure and learning algorithms with the neuron output feedback","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Artificial neural networks","Neurons","Output feedback","Heuristic algorithms","Biological neural networks","Nonlinear dynamical systems","Mathematical model"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feedback","learning (artificial intelligence)","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural network structure","learning algorithm","output feedback neural model","static knowledge learning","dynamic knowledge learning","dynamic neural network","minimum variance theory","static mapping","neuron output feedback coefficient","dynamic evolution performance"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5585172/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 Aug. 2010","displayDocTitle":"A neural network structure and learning algorithms with the neuron output feedback","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5585172/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"23 September 2010","conferenceDate":"25-27 Aug. 2010","accessionNumber":"11553925","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A neural network structure and learning algorithms with the neuron output feedback","confLoc":"Suzhou, China","sourcePdf":"paper218.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065921S","chronDate":"25-27 Aug. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5573998","isNumber":"5585103","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5573998","xplore-issue":"5585103","articleId":"5585172","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":5585206,"authors":[{"name":"Wei-jiang Wang","affiliation":["School of Information and Electronics, Beijing Institute of Technology, China"],"lastName":"Wei-jiang Wang","id":"37292854700"},{"name":"Wei Zuo","affiliation":["School of Information and Electronics, Beijing Institute of Technology, China"],"lastName":"Wei Zuo","id":"38196402000"},{"name":"Xue-mei Yan","affiliation":["School of Information and Electronics, Beijing Institute of Technology, China"],"lastName":"Xue-mei Yan","id":"37653294100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6337-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6334-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6336-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5585206","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":232},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Watermarking","Quaternions","Gray-scale","Fourier transforms","Discrete wavelet transforms","Color"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Fourier transforms","Gray codes","image coding","image colour analysis","watermarking"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["gray scale watermarking algorithm","color image","quaternion Fourier transform","RGB carrier image","color component","imaginary quaternion","carrier image","2D-QFT"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["QFT","RGB image","Gray-scale watermark","imperceptbility"]}],"abstract":"A scheme of embedding gray-scale watermark image into an RGB carrier image based on the fast Quaternion Fourier Transform (QFT) is proposed.

In this paper, we propose two strategies to enhance PSO via probabilistic models. Firstly, we exploit problem structures in PSO to repel premature convergence, where problem specific interactions among variables are represented as a mixture of multivariate normal distributions. Secondly, the authors propose a hybrid constraint handling method for PSO via combining \u201cfeasibility and dominance\u201d (FAD) rules with sampling from a mixture of Truncated Multivariate Normal Distributions (mixed TMNDs), where the constraints are restricted to linear inequalities and represented as mixed TMNDs.

The evaluation shows that the proposed algorithm performs very closely to the optimal PTS in many cases with much lower complexity.","doi":"10.1109/ICAL.2010.5585297","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Automation and Logistics","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Automation and Logistics","pdfPath":"/iel5/5570126/5585273/05585297.pdf","startPage":"302","endPage":"305","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICAL.2010.5585297","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5585273","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"PAPR reduction with phase factors suboptimization for OFDM systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5585297","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-20 Aug. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5585297/","displayDocTitle":"PAPR reduction with phase factors suboptimization for OFDM systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2010","accessionNumber":"11556168","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5585297/","conferenceDate":"16-20 Aug. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"23 September 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"PAPR reduction with phase factors suboptimization for OFDM systems","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"0054.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056863S","chronDate":"16-20 Aug. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5570126","isNumber":"5585273","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5570126","xplore-issue":"5585273","articleId":"5585297","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5585303,"authors":[{"name":"Emil Petre","affiliation":["Department of Automatic Control, University of Craiova, Craiova, Romania"],"firstName":"Emil","lastName":"Petre","id":"37542139000"},{"name":"Dan Seli\u015fteanu","affiliation":["Department of Automatic Control, University of Craiova, Craiova, Romania"],"firstName":"Dan","lastName":"Seli\u015fteanu","id":"37547660100"},{"name":"Dorin \u015eendrescu","affiliation":["Department of Automatic Control, University of Craiova, Craiova, Romania"],"firstName":"Dorin","lastName":"\u015eendrescu","id":"37542131500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8376-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8375-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8374-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-8151"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-816X"}],"articleNumber":"5585303","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":54},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5585303","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Substrates","Adaptive control","Artificial neural networks","Pollution measurement","Inductors","Biomass","Silicon compounds"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive control","bioreactors","delays","linearisation techniques","nonlinear control systems","radial basis function networks","time-varying systems","wastewater treatment"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive control","time delay","bioeletrochemical process","nonlinear control strategy","time varying wastewater treatment bioprocess","radial basis function neural network","input-output feedback linearization technique"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Nonlinear systems","Bioprocesses","Nonlinear control","Neural networks","Adaptive control"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICAL.2010.5585303","pdfPath":"/iel5/5570126/5585273/05585303.pdf","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Automation and Logistics","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Automation and Logistics","startPage":"335","endPage":"340","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5585273","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICAL.2010.5585303","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive control of a time delay bioeletrochemical process using neural networks","abstract":"This paper studies the design and the analysis of a nonlinear and neural adaptive control strategy for a complex nonlinear and time varying wastewater treatment bioprocess.

However, the lack of a simple hardware design that is capable of modifying the fuzzy controller's parameters to adapt for any changes in the operation environment, or behavior of the plant system limits the applicability of fuzzy based control systems in the automotive and industrial environments. The design and implementation of an FPGA based fuzzy logic controller, that allows real-time modification of its membership functions and rule base is introduced in this paper. The development of the controller's architecture is carried out on a National Instruments Intelligent DAQ board (PCI-7833R) with a reconfigurable Xilinx Virtex-II FPGA. The proposed design combines the performance advantages of existing static FPGA based fuzzy control architectures, with the flexibility and ease of implementation of conventional micro-controllers and general purpose processors. To test the efficiency of the controller and its ability to stabilize a highly dynamic system, a semi-active suspension system was developed. Simulation results for the proposed FPGA controller showed a 56% characteristic enhancement over the standard passive suspension system.","doi":"10.1109/ICAL.2010.5585344","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICAL.2010.5585344","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Automation and Logistics","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Automation and Logistics","pdfPath":"/iel5/5570126/5585273/05585344.pdf","startPage":"539","endPage":"544","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5585273","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5585344/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-20 Aug. 2010","displayDocTitle":"FPGA based real-time adaptive fuzzy logic controller","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"16-20 Aug. 2010","accessionNumber":"11556193","htmlLink":"/document/5585344/","dateOfInsertion":"23 September 2010","publicationDate":"Aug. 2010","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FPGA based real-time adaptive fuzzy logic controller","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"0099.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047607S","chronDate":"16-20 Aug. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5570126","isNumber":"5585273","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5570126","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5585273","articleId":"5585344","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-09"},{"_id":5585365,"authors":[{"name":"Ren Yuan","affiliation":["College of Electromechenical Engineering, Henan University of Science and Technology, Luoyang, Henan, China"],"lastName":"Ren Yuan","id":"37087919028"},{"name":"Zhong Zhidan","affiliation":["College of Electromechenical Engineering, Henan University of Science and Technology, Luoyang, Henan, China"],"lastName":"Zhong Zhidan","id":"37087919055"},{"name":"Zhang Bo","affiliation":["College of Electromechenical Engineering, Henan University of Science and Technology, Luoyang, Henan, China"],"lastName":"Zhang Bo","id":"37087271983"},{"name":"Lv Feng","affiliation":["College of Electromechenical Engineering, Henan University of Science and Technology, Luoyang, Henan, China"],"lastName":"Lv Feng","id":"37087282647"},{"name":"Xu Huili","affiliation":["College of Electromechenical Engineering, Henan University of Science and Technology, Luoyang, Henan, China"],"lastName":"Xu Huili","id":"37087917928"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8376-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8375-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8374-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-8151"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-816X"}],"articleNumber":"5585365","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":199},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fuel cells","Optimization","Particle swarm optimization","Atmospheric modeling","Mathematical model","Fuels","Equations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["costing","fuel cell power plants","fuzzy set theory","particle swarm optimisation","power generation economics","proton exchange membrane fuel cells"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiobjective fuzzy particle swarm optimization","MOFPSO","proton exchange membrane fuel cells generation system","PEM fuel cell generation economic aspects","generation cost"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cells (PEMFC)","Multi-Objective Fuzzy Particle Swarm Optimizer (MOFPSO)"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5585365","abstract":"This paper proposed multi-objective fuzzy particle swarm optimization (MOFPSO) for the Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cells (PEMFC) generation system.

RBF neural networks constitute a subset of the neuronal networks, which has a great potential in reducing the size of the network. Pulse mode neural networks reduce significantly hardware resources by replacing the conventional huge multiplier by a simple frequency multiplier. As application, we approximate with the proposed RBF network, a Canny operator based edge detection, which is an important step in image processing.

These risk components were used as an input to the feed forward NN trained with Back Propagation algorithm (BPNN). The accuracy of the network was found to be equal to 96% for the proposed system.

In this paper, we propose a new technique for the optimal location and design of two kinds of Flexible AC Transmission System Devices (FACTS) namely: Satitic Var Compensator (SVC) and Thyristor Controlled Series Compensator (TCSC) handling the minimization of transmission losses in electrical network. Using the proposed scheme, the type, the location and the rating of FACTS devices are optimized simultaneously. The problem to solve is multi criteria under constraints related to the load flow equations, the voltages, the transformer turn ratios, the active and reactive productions and the compensation devices. Its resolution requires the employ of the advanced algorithms. Thus, we propose an approach based on the evolutionary algorithms (EA) to solve this problem multi criterion. It is about the NSGA-II method (Ellitist Non Dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm). The Pareto front is obtained for continuous, discrete and multiple of five MVArs of compensator devices for the IEEE 57-bus test system.","doi":"10.1109/SSD.2010.5585557","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SSD.2010.5585557","publicationTitle":"2010 7th International Multi- Conference on Systems, Signals and Devices","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 7th International Multi- Conference on Systems, Signals and Devices","pdfPath":"/iel5/5573999/5585495/05585557.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5585495","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5585557/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 June 2010","displayDocTitle":"FACTS placement multiobjective optimization for reactive power system compensation","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"27-30 June 2010","accessionNumber":"11558689","htmlLink":"/document/5585557/","dateOfInsertion":"27 September 2010","publicationDate":"June 2010","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FACTS placement multiobjective optimization for reactive power system compensation","confLoc":"Amman, Jordan","sourcePdf":"1569288547.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.138454S","chronDate":"27-30 June 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5573999","isNumber":"5585495","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5573999","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"5585495","articleId":"5585557","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5585576,"authors":[{"name":"Hassine Amira","affiliation":["Syscom Laboratory, ENIT Tunis, Tunis, Tunisia"],"firstName":"Hassine","lastName":"Amira","id":"37062530600"},{"name":"Rhouma Rhouma","affiliation":["Syscom Laboratory, ENIT Tunis, Tunis, Tunisia"],"firstName":"Rhouma","lastName":"Rhouma","id":"37640764800"},{"name":"Safya Belghith","affiliation":["Syscom Laboratory, ENIT Tunis, Tunis, Tunisia"],"firstName":"Safya","lastName":"Belghith","id":"37399602700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7534-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7532-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-7533-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5585576","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":194},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Watermarking"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","image coding","watermarking"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["eigenvalue based watermarking scheme","tamper detection","gray level images","digital content","fragile watermarking technique","collage attack","intelligent attacks","vector quantization attack","logistic map"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["fragile watermarking","tamper detection","Eigen value","VQ attack","chaos"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5585576","doi":"10.1109/SSD.2010.5585576","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SSD.2010.5585576","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5585495","publicationTitle":"2010 7th International Multi- Conference on Systems, Signals and Devices","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 7th International Multi- Conference on Systems, Signals and Devices","pdfPath":"/iel5/5573999/5585495/05585576.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An eigen value based watermarking scheme for tamper detection in gray level images","abstract":"Fragile watermarking is used to determine if a digital content has been tampered, and localize tampered regions without referring to the original content. In this paper, we present a novel fragile watermarking technique for tamper detection in gray level images. The proposed method is efficient for simple and intelligent attacks such as collage attack and Vector quantization attack. The embedding process of the watermark starts from computing the Eigen values of the chaotically mixed image and that stands for the watermark, followed by inserting it into the LSBs chosen using the logistic map. The chaotic map is used to improve the security of our algorithm and to contribute with the Eigen values computation by making the watermark as unique as possible in order to face off intelligent attacks.

In this technique, the amplitude excitations of some side elements are reduced while those of the others are increased by proper power division or weighting in the feed network of the array. Theoretical analysis and computer simulations are presented to verify the proposed idea. A 3-element array is studied first, then the idea is extended to a 7-element array.

In this paper, a Neural Network based PI controller and Neural Network based PID controller are designed and simulated to increase the position accuracy in a pneumatic servo actuator. In these designs, a well-trained Neural Network provides these controllers with suitable gains depending on feedback representing changes in position error and changes in external load force. These gains should keep the positional response within minimum overshoot, minimum rise time and minimum steady state error. A comparison between Neural Network based PI controller and Neural Network based PID controller was made to find the best controller that can be generated with simple structure according to the number of hidden layers and the number of neurons per layer. It was concluded that the Neural Network based PID controller was trained and generated with simpler structure and minimum Mean Square Error compared with the trained and generated one used with PI controller.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 June 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5585598/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11558628","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5585598/","publicationDate":"June 2010","dateOfInsertion":"27 September 2010","conferenceDate":"27-30 June 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Comparison between Neural Network based PI and PID controllers","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparison between Neural Network based PI and PID controllers","confLoc":"Amman, Jordan","sourcePdf":"1569283209.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061147S","chronDate":"27-30 June 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5573999","isNumber":"5585495","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5573999","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"5585495","articleId":"5585598","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5585601,"authors":[{"name":"Hikmat N.

It decouples the precoder design problem and makes closed-form solution available. In this letter, we present a new linear precoding scheme by slightly relaxing the SLNR maximization for MU-MIMO systems with multiple data streams per user. The precoding matrices are obtained by a general form of simultaneous diagonalization of two Hermitian matrices. The new scheme reduces the gap between the per-stream effective channel gains, an inherent limitation in the original SLNR precoding scheme. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed precoding achieves considerable gains in error performance over the original one for multi-stream transmission while maintaining almost the same achievable sum-rate.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A New SLNR-Based Linear Precoding for Downlink Multi-User Multi-Stream MIMO Systems","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","doi":"10.1109/LCOMM.2010.091710.100868","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/4234/5623935/05585624.pdf","startPage":"1008","endPage":"1010","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCOMM.2010.091710.100868","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5623935","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5585624","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5585624/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 September 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"November  2010","displayDocTitle":"A New SLNR-Based Linear Precoding for Downlink Multi-User Multi-Stream MIMO Systems","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"14","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/5585624/","dateOfInsertion":"09 November 2010","publicationDate":"November 2010","accessionNumber":"11630146","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A New SLNR-Based Linear Precoding for Downlink Multi-User Multi-Stream MIMO Systems","sourcePdf":"1008-cl1011-cheng.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033529S","chronDate":"November  2010","xplore-pub-id":"4234","isNumber":"5623935","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4234","citationCount":"52","xplore-issue":"5623935","articleId":"5585624","onlineDate":"27 September 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5585625,"authors":[{"name":"Changkyu Seol","affiliation":["Division of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Pohang University of Science and Technology, South Korea","Semiconductor Business, Samsung Electronics Company Limited, South Korea"],"firstName":"Changkyu","lastName":"Seol","id":"37294615300"},{"name":"Kyungwhoon Cheun","affiliation":["Division of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Pohang University of Science and Technology, Pohang, South Korea"],"firstName":"Kyungwhoon","lastName":"Cheun","id":"37294128700"},{"name":"Sungnam Hong","affiliation":["Division of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Pohang University of Science and Technology, Pohang, South Korea"],"firstName":"Sungnam","lastName":"Hong","id":"37856951100"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"5585625","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":489},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decoding","Measurement","Rayleigh channels","Loading","Mobile communication","Shadow mapping"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","frequency division multiple access","OFDM modulation","Rician channels","statistical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["downlink cellular OFDMA networks","log-normal shadowing","Ricean fading","orthogonal frequency division multiple access","Gaussian distribution","statistical intercell interference model"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Multiple access interference","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM)","orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA)","soft decision decoding"]}],"abstract":"In this letter, an approximation to the performance of downlink cellular orthogonal frequency division multiple access networks under log-normal shadowing and Ricean fading is evaluated.

A passive anti-PUE approach, similar to the random frequency hopping in traditional anti-jamming schemes, is proposed and called dogfight in spectrum. In this scheme, the defenders randomly choose channels to sense and avoid the PUE attack. It is assumed that the channel statistics like availability probabilities are known; then the PUE attack and the random hopping are modeled as a zero-sum game between the attacker and defending secondary user(s). The Nash equilibrium of the game is found. The anti-jamming efficiency is also obtained. Numerical simulations demonstrated the performances of the proposed schemes for both the single defender, multiple defender and multiple round cases.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5585629/","chronOrPublicationDate":"November  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 September 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"9","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"November 2010","dateOfInsertion":"11 November 2010","accessionNumber":"11638071","htmlLink":"/document/5585629/","displayDocTitle":"Dogfight in Spectrum: Combating Primary User Emulation Attacks in Cognitive Radio Systems, Part I: Known Channel Statistics","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dogfight in Spectrum: Combating Primary User Emulation Attacks in Cognitive Radio Systems, Part I: Known Channel Statistics","sourcePdf":"3566-tw1011-li.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.077631S","chronDate":"November  2010","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"5626930","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"74","xplore-issue":"5626930","articleId":"5585629","onlineDate":"27 September 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5585631,"authors":[{"name":"Hui Shen","affiliation":["Department of Corporate Research, Huawei Technologies Company Limited, Shenzhen, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/5626930/5585631/5585631-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Hui Shen (M'09) was born in 1975.

In practical systems, the design of specific interference alignment schemes is subject to various criteria and constraints. In this paper, we propose novel transceiver schemes for the MIMO interference channel based on the mean square error (MSE) criterion. Our objective is to optimize the system performance under a given and feasible degree of freedom. Both the total MSE and the maximum per-user MSE are chosen to be the objective functions to minimize. We show that the joint design of transmit precoding matrices and receiving filter matrices with both objectives can be realized through efficient iterative algorithms. The convergence of the proposed algorithms is proven as well. Simulation results show that the proposed schemes outperform the existing IA schemes in terms of BER performance. Considering the imperfection of channel state information (CSI), we also extend the MSE-based transceiver schemes for the MIMO interference channel with CSI estimation error. The robustness of the proposed algorithms is confirmed by simulations.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MSE-Based Transceiver Designs for the MIMO Interference Channel","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2010.091510.091836","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/5626930/05585631.pdf","startPage":"3480","endPage":"3489","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2010.091510.091836","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5626930","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5585631","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5585631/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 September 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"November  2010","displayDocTitle":"MSE-Based Transceiver Designs for the MIMO Interference Channel","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"9","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/5585631/","dateOfInsertion":"11 November 2010","publicationDate":"November 2010","accessionNumber":"11638085","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MSE-Based Transceiver Designs for the MIMO Interference Channel","sourcePdf":"3480-tw1011-shen.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073719S","chronDate":"November  2010","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"5626930","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"167","xplore-issue":"5626930","articleId":"5585631","onlineDate":"27 September 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5585632,"authors":[{"name":"Alberto Rabbachin","affiliation":["Institute for the Protection and Security of the Citizen of the Joint Research Center, European Commission, Ispra Varese, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/5626930/5585632/5585632-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Alberto Rabbachin (S'03-M'07) received the M.S. degree from the University of Bologna (Italy) in 2001 and the Ph.D. degree from the University of Oulu (Finland) in 2008.

However, the presence of narrowband (NB) interference severely degrades the communication performance since the energy of the interfering signals is also collected by the receiver. In this paper, we compare the performance of two non-coherent UWB receiver structures - the autocorrelation receiver (AcR) and the energy detection receiver (EDR) - in terms of the bit error probability (BEP). The AcR is based on the transmitted reference signaling with binary pulse amplitude modulation, while the EDR is based on the binary pulse position modulation. We analyze the BEPs for these two non-coherent systems in a multipath fading channel, both in the absence and presence of NB interference. We consider two cases: a) single NB interferer, where the interfering node is located at a fixed distance from the receiver, and b) multiple NB interferers, where the interfering nodes with the same carrier frequency are scattered according to a spatial Poisson process. Our framework is simple enough to enable a tractable analysis and provide insights that are of value in the design of practical UWB systems subject to interference.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2010.091510.080203","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/5626930/05585632.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2010.091510.080203","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5626930","startPage":"3365","endPage":"3379","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Non-Coherent UWB Communication in the Presence of Multiple Narrowband Interferers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5585632","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Non-Coherent UWB Communication in the Presence of Multiple Narrowband Interferers","chronOrPublicationDate":"November  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5585632/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 September 2010","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"9","issue":"11","publicationDate":"November 2010","accessionNumber":"11638088","dateOfInsertion":"11 November 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5585632/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Non-Coherent UWB Communication in the Presence of Multiple Narrowband Interferers","sourcePdf":"3365-tw1011-rabbachin.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.112317S","chronDate":"November  2010","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"5626930","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"44","xplore-issue":"5626930","articleId":"5585632","onlineDate":"27 September 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5585633,"authors":[{"name":"H.

The analysis is of interest in practical applications of multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, where a perfect estimate of the channel correlation matrix is not available. The channel estimation mean square error (MSE) is analytically analyzed assuming a general structure for the estimated channel correlation matrix used to implement the LMMSE channel estimator. The obtained results are successively detailed to the case of channel correlation matrices derived by sample correlation estimation methods. It is observed that the use of a coarse estimate of the channel correlation matrix can lead to a severe degradation on the LMMSE channel estimator performance, whereas the simpler least-square (LS) channel estimator may provide comparatively better results. Nevertheless, it is shown that a robust approach, although suboptimal, relies on implementing the LMMSE channel estimator by assuming transmissions over uncorrelated channels, since, with such an assumption, the resulting estimation MSE is certainly smaller than for the LS channel estimator.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2010.091510.100026","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/5626930/05585634.pdf","startPage":"3313","endPage":"3319","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2010.091510.100026","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5626930","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Robustness of MIMO LMMSE Channel Estimation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5585634","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 September 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"November  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5585634/","displayDocTitle":"On the Robustness of MIMO LMMSE Channel Estimation","volume":"9","issue":"11","publicationDate":"November 2010","accessionNumber":"11646679","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5585634/","dateOfInsertion":"11 November 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Robustness of MIMO LMMSE Channel Estimation","sourcePdf":"3313-tw1011-assalini.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.081559S","chronDate":"November  2010","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"5626930","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"5626930","articleId":"5585634","onlineDate":"27 September 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5585636,"authors":[{"name":"Sarath Gopi","affiliation":["Spann Laboratory, Department of Electrical Engineering, IIT Bombay, Mumbai, India"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/5626930/5585636/5585636-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Sarath Gopi received the BE in electronics and communication engineering from the National Institute of Technology, Calicut, India in 2002, and the MTech in electrical engineering from IIT Bombay, India in 2008.

In the proposed E-PULRP, sensor nodes report events to a stationary sink node using on the fly routing. E-PULRP consists of a layering phase and communication phase. In the layering phase, a layering structure is presented wherein nodes occupy different layers in the form of concentric shells, around a sink node. The layer widths and transmission energy of nodes in each layer are chosen taking into consideration the probability of successful packet transmission and minimization of overall energy expenditure in packet transmission. During the communication phase, we propose a method to select intermediate relay nodes on the fly, for delivering packets from the source node to sink node. We develop a mathematical framework to analyse the energy optimization achieved by E-PULRP. We further obtain expressions for throughput, delay and derive performance bounds for node densities and packet forwarding probabilities, for given traffic conditions. A comparison is made between the results obtained based on simulations and analytical expressions. The energy efficiency is also demonstrated in comparison with existing routing protocol for underwater sensor networks.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2010.091510.090452","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/5626930/05585636.pdf","startPage":"3391","endPage":"3401","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5626930","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2010.091510.090452","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"November  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 September 2010","displayDocTitle":"E-PULRP: Energy Optimized Path Unaware Layered Routing Protocol for Underwater Sensor Networks","volume":"9","issue":"11","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5585636/","dateOfInsertion":"11 November 2010","publicationDate":"November 2010","accessionNumber":"11638089","isJournal":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5585636/","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"E-PULRP: Energy Optimized Path Unaware Layered Routing Protocol for Underwater Sensor Networks","sourcePdf":"3391-tw1011-gopi.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.068332S","chronDate":"November  2010","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"5626930","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"47","xplore-issue":"5626930","articleId":"5585636","onlineDate":"27 September 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-16"},{"_id":5585637,"authors":[{"name":"Husheng Li","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Tennessee, Knoxville, TN, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/5626930/5585637/5585637-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Husheng Li (S'00-M'05) received the BS and MS degrees in electronic engineering from Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, in 1998 and 2000, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from Princeton University, Princeton, NJ, in 2005.","From 2005 to 2007, he worked as a senior engineer at Qualcomm Inc., San Diego, CA.

Therefore, it is necessary to detect potential attacker(s) and then exclude the attacker's report for spectrum sensing. Many existing attacker-detection schemes are based on the knowledge of the attacker's strategy and thus apply the Bayesian attacker detection. However, in practical cognitive radio systems the data fusion center typically does not know the attacker's strategy. To alleviate the problem of the unknown strategy of attacker(s), an abnormality-detection approach, based on the abnormality detection in data mining, is proposed. The performance of the attacker detection in the single-attacker scenario is analyzed explicitly. For the case in which the attacker does not know the reports of honest secondary users (called independent attack), it is shown that the attacker can always be detected as the number of spectrum sensing rounds tends to infinity. For the case in which the attacker knows all the reports of other secondary users, based on which the attacker sends its report (called dependent attack), an approach for the attacker to perfectly avoid being detected is found, provided that the attacker has perfect information about the miss-detection and false-alarm probabilities. This motivates cognitive radio networks to protect the reports of secondary users. The performance of attacker detection in the general case of multiple attackers is demonstrated using numerical simulations.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5585637/","chronOrPublicationDate":"November  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 September 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"9","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"November 2010","dateOfInsertion":"11 November 2010","accessionNumber":"11638076","htmlLink":"/document/5585637/","displayDocTitle":"Catch Me if You Can: An Abnormality Detection Approach for Collaborative Spectrum Sensing in Cognitive Radio Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Catch Me if You Can: An Abnormality Detection Approach for Collaborative Spectrum Sensing in Cognitive Radio Networks","sourcePdf":"3554-tw1011-li.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.069187S","chronDate":"November  2010","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"5626930","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"102","xplore-issue":"5626930","articleId":"5585637","onlineDate":"27 September 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5585638,"authors":[{"name":"Bhargav Medepally","affiliation":["ST-Ericsson, Bangalore, India"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/5626930/5585638/5585638-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Bhargav Medepally received his Bachelor of Engineering degree in Electronics and Communications Engineering from the Vasavi College of Engineering, Hyderabad, India in 2007.

It harnesses the spatial diversity of a multi-relay network and addresses the vexing problem of a relay's batteries getting drained in forwarding information to the destination. We consider a cooperative system in which EH nodes volunteer to serve as amplify-and-forward relays whenever they have sufficient energy for transmission. For a general class of stationary and ergodic EH processes, we introduce the notion of energy constrained and energy unconstrained relays and analytically characterize the symbol error rate of the system. Further insight is gained by an asymptotic analysis that considers the cases where the signal-to-noise-ratio or the number of relays is large. Our analysis quantifies how the energy usage at an EH relay and, consequently, its availability for relaying, depends not only on the relay's energy harvesting process, but also on its transmit power setting and the other relays in the system. The optimal static transmit power setting at the EH relays is also determined. Altogether, our results demonstrate how a system that uses EH relays differs in significant ways from one that uses conventional cooperative relays.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2010.091510.100447","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5626930","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2010.091510.100447","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/5626930/05585638.pdf","startPage":"3543","endPage":"3553","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Voluntary Energy Harvesting Relays and Selection in Cooperative Wireless Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 September 2010","displayDocTitle":"Voluntary Energy Harvesting Relays and Selection in Cooperative Wireless Networks","volume":"9","issue":"11","chronOrPublicationDate":"November  2010","dateOfInsertion":"11 November 2010","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5585638/","publicationDate":"November 2010","accessionNumber":"11638077","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5585638/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Voluntary Energy Harvesting Relays and Selection in Cooperative Wireless Networks","sourcePdf":"3543-tw1011-medepally.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.137014S","chronDate":"November  2010","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"5626930","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"254","xplore-issue":"5626930","articleId":"5585638","onlineDate":"27 September 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5585639,"authors":[{"name":"Zhikun Xu","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Information Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/5626930/5585639/5585639-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Zhikun Xu received his B.S. degree in electronics engineering in 2007 and now is pursuing his Ph.D. degree in signal and information processing, both in the School of Electronics and Information Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, China.

In this paper, we jointly optimize secondary transceivers assuming that the frequency offset between the secondary transmitter (ST) and the primary receiver (PR) and different channel information from the ST to the PR are known at the ST. We first derive unified interference constraints and obtain the secondary transceivers minimizing the mean square error through convex optimization techniques. We then derive closed-form transceivers for several special cases to reveal the impact of the frequency offset on the secondary transceivers. We show that when there is no frequency offset between the ST and the PR, the optimal processing at the ST is power allocation. Otherwise, both power allocation and precoding are necessary. The impact of the frequency offset on the performance of both systems increases as the interference constraints become tighter and the bandwidth of the primary system becomes smaller. When the proposed transceivers are used, the performance of the secondary system is robust to the frequency offset and the performance of the primary system degrades little due to the remanent frequency offset.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5585639/","chronOrPublicationDate":"November  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 September 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5585639/","dateOfInsertion":"11 November 2010","publicationDate":"November 2010","accessionNumber":"11638081","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"9","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Secondary Transceiver Design in the Presence of Frequency Offset between Primary and Secondary Systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Secondary Transceiver Design in the Presence of Frequency Offset between Primary and Secondary Systems","sourcePdf":"3461-tw1011-xu.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.095431S","chronDate":"November  2010","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"5626930","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5626930","articleId":"5585639","onlineDate":"27 September 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":5585644,"authors":[{"name":"Yuelan Lu","affiliation":["Department of Physics, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, ONT, Canada"],"bio":{"p":["Yuelan Lu was born in Heilongjiang, China, in 1968.

The device estimates the DoA by identifying the peak of received signal strength indicator (RSSI) measurements using an actuated parabolic reflector. Automatic localization is an important requirement for deployment of wireless sensor networks. Localization from distance measurement alone is a challenging problem, but becomes easier if relative angular position measurements between pairs of radio nodes are available. Methods of DoA estimation such as phased arrays are unsuitable for wireless sensor networks due to size, cost and complexity limitations. The device and the algorithm we describe is compact and simple enough to be suitable for WSNs. Experimental results show that the error in the measured DoA has a mean smaller than 4\u00b0 and standard deviation of smaller than 8\u00b0, in both indoor and outdoor environments in line of sight situations.

The successful results indicate that biomimetic sensors may have a role in the quest to miniaturize the autopilots of small unmanned aerial vehicles.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Biomimetic Attitude and Orientation Sensors","publicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","doi":"10.1109/JSEN.2010.2078806","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","pdfPath":"/iel5/7361/6094080/05585652.pdf","startPage":"289","endPage":"297","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSEN.2010.2078806","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6094080","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5585652","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5585652/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 September 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2012","displayDocTitle":"Biomimetic Attitude and Orientation Sensors","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"12","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/5585652/","dateOfInsertion":"05 December 2011","publicationDate":"Feb. 2012","accessionNumber":"12403948","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Biomimetic Attitude and Orientation Sensors","sourcePdf":"jsen-chahl-2078806-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.071345S","chronDate":"Feb.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"7361","isNumber":"6094080","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7361","citationCount":"62","xplore-issue":"6094080","articleId":"5585652","onlineDate":"27 September 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-22"},{"_id":5585658,"authors":[{"name":"Saverio De Vito","affiliation":["Daeimi Department, University of Cassino, Cassino, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7361/5708787/5585658/5585658-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Saverio De Vito received the M.S. degree in informatics engineering from the University of Naples, \u201cFederico II,\u201d Naples, Italy, in 1998.","During 1998 and 1999, he was a Research Fellow at the Artificial Vision and Intelligent Systems Laboratory, University of Naples \u201cFederico II,\u201d working on breast cancer computer-aided diagnosis.

The PEA imagers are more sensitive by a few orders of magnitude than regular CCD cameras and by an order of magnitude than most sensitive scientific LLLI CCD cameras. The Electron-Bombarded CMOS Image Sensor (EB-CMOS-IS) is a novel PEA technology and has just recently become commercially available. The EB-CMOS-IS technology is a best price/performance combination among concurrent technologies such as EBCCD, EMCCD, Intensified CCD, and Intensified CMOS image sensors. Although the EB-CMOS-IS-based applications demonstrate outstanding sensitivity, they are exploited today far from their maximal potential. In this study, we developed a comprehensive model of the EB-CMOS-IS used for simulation of the sensor performance as a function of the device parameters, e.g., photocathode quantum efficiency, acceleration bias, electrons-to-voltage conversion factor, and operation parameters, e.g., amplifier gain, offset, and exposure time. We selected parameters enabling a single photon imaging (SPI) mode and performed imaging simulations for an object under various low-level illumination conditions.

Sensor networks provide a new technological support for a substantial increase in an amount and quality of information that might be collected and communicated in complex adaptive systems. Their application may significantly raise the degree of intelligence in system design and implementation into the levels where effects of cognition will start kicking in. The paper describes the results of an empirical study aiming to demonstrate that a cognition ability may be treated as a generic sensor network feature. The new architecture with neural networks distributed over the sensor network platforms was developed for sensor network engineering applications. The detection system learns to detect the change of not only the signal levels but also sensor signal shapes and parameters that represent a more complicated task. The architecture allows for a significant reduction in resource consumption without compromising the change detection performance. Implemented as an agent controlling the sensor network self-adjustment to the objects under measurement in the sensor network composed from typical sensor motes, the novel neural network structures may achieve a significant saving in power consumption and an increase in a possible network deployment time from a few days to a few years. The experiments prove that a neural-network-based change detection system is feasible for sensor networks application designs and could be successfully implemented on the technological platforms currently available on the market.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5585679/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 September 2010","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11804761","volume":"11","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/5585679/","publicationDate":"March 2011","dateOfInsertion":"31 January 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Distributed Neural Networks for Signal Change Detection: On the Way to Cognition in Sensor Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed Neural Networks for Signal Change Detection: On the Way to Cognition in Sensor Networks","sourcePdf":"jsen-reznik-2070837-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.068378S","chronDate":"March  2011","xplore-pub-id":"7361","isNumber":"5697312","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7361","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5697312","articleId":"5585679","onlineDate":"27 September 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5585703,"authors":[{"name":"Masayuki Terai","affiliation":["LSI Research Laboratory, Renesas Electronics Corporation, Kanagawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Masayuki","lastName":"Terai","id":"37285407000"},{"name":"Yukihiro Sakotsubo","affiliation":["LSI Research Laboratory, Renesas Electronics Corporation, Kanagawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Yukihiro","lastName":"Sakotsubo","id":"37394255800"},{"name":"Yukihiro Saito","affiliation":["Device Platforms Research Laboratories, NEC Corporation Limited, Kanagawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Yukihiro","lastName":"Saito","id":"38189289900"},{"name":"Setsu Kotsuji","affiliation":["Device Platforms Research Laboratories, NEC Corporation Limited, Kanagawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Setsu","lastName":"Kotsuji","id":"37297615700"},{"name":"Hiromitsu Hada","affiliation":["Device Platforms Research Laboratories, NEC Corporation Limited, Kanagawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Hiromitsu","lastName":"Hada","id":"37294548900"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0741-3106"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0563"}],"articleNumber":"5585703","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":13,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1196},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Electron Devices Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/eds/"}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Memory-State Dependence of Random Telegraph Noise of -

The OSNR, CD, and PMD monitoring range and root-mean-square (rms) errors are 10-30 and 0.43 dB, 0-400 and 9.82 ps/nm, and 0-10 and 0.92 ps, respectively, for RZ-DQPSK systems. For 16-QAM system, the monitoring range and rms errors are 10-30 and 0.2 dB, 0-400 and 9.66 ps/nm, and 0-30 and 0.65 ps for OSNR, CD, and PMD, respectively. As the generation of AAH does not require any clock or timing recovery, the proposed technique can serve as a low-cost option to realize in-service multiparameter monitoring for the next-generation transparent optical networks.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5585710/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.15,  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 September 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"22","issue":"22","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov.15, 2010","dateOfInsertion":"21 October 2010","accessionNumber":"11597228","htmlLink":"/document/5585710/","displayDocTitle":"Optical Performance Monitoring Using Artificial Neural Network Trained With Asynchronous Amplitude Histograms","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optical Performance Monitoring Using Artificial Neural Network Trained With Asynchronous Amplitude Histograms","sourcePdf":"lpt-shen-2078804-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.046824S","chronDate":"Nov.15,  2010","xplore-pub-id":"68","isNumber":"5607254","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"68","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"5607254","articleId":"5585710","onlineDate":"27 September 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5585715,"authors":[{"name":"Heesun Park","affiliation":["Scientific Computing Laboratory, Department of Electrical Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Heesun","lastName":"Park","id":"38086606000"},{"name":"Joohwan Chun","affiliation":["Scientific Computing Laboratory, Department of Electrical Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Joohwan","lastName":"Chun","id":"37272877200"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1070-9908"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2361"}],"articleNumber":"5585715","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":413},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Receiving antennas","MIMO","Transmitting antennas","Channel capacity","Computational complexity"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel capacity","eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","MIMO communication","receiving antennas","transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["two-stage antenna subset selection scheme","amplify-and-forward MIMO relay systems","channel capacity","receive antenna","transmit antenna"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Amplify-and-forward multiple-input multiple-output relay","antenna selection","channel capacity"]}],"abstract":"A two-stage antenna subset selection scheme is proposed to maximize the channel capacity of amplify-and-forward multiple-input multiple-output relay systems.

As a feedback to the feature extraction stage, top confusions of this system are identified, and a second set of filters are designed specifically to address these confusions. Phoneme recognition experiments on TIMIT show that the features derived from the combined set of discriminative filters outperform conventional speech recognition features, and also contain significant complementary information.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Feature extraction","Speech","Speech recognition","Context","Hidden Markov models","Acoustics","Speech processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feature extraction","filtering theory","hidden Markov models","multilayer perceptrons","speech recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feedback based spectro-temporal features","feature extraction","automatic speech recognition","spectro-temporal filters","hidden Markov model","multilayer perceptron","discriminative filters"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Confusion analysis","discriminative filters","spectro-temporal features","speech recognition"]}],"doi":"10.1109/LSP.2010.2079930","publicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/97/5559660/05585716.pdf","startPage":"957","endPage":"960","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5559660","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LSP.2010.2079930","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Data-Driven and Feedback Based Spectro-Temporal Features for Speech Recognition","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5585716","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Data-Driven and Feedback Based Spectro-Temporal Features for Speech Recognition","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5585716/","volume":"17","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5585716/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"11560856","dateOfInsertion":"04 October 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 September 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Data-Driven and Feedback Based Spectro-Temporal Features for Speech Recognition","sourcePdf":"lsp-garimella-2079930-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.061062S","chronDate":"Nov.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"97","isNumber":"5559660","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"97","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"5559660","articleId":"5585716","onlineDate":"27 September 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5585718,"authors":[{"name":"Sergey Dashkovskiy","affiliation":["Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science, University of Brethemen, Bremen, Germany"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/9/5784391/5585718/5585718-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Sergey Dashkovskiy received the M.Sc. degree from the Moscow (Lomonosov) State University, Moscow, Russia, in 1996 and the Ph.D. degree from the University of Jena, Germany, in 2002, both in mathematics, and the Habilitation degree in mathematics from the University of Bremen, Germany, in 2009.","He is Senior Researcher in Systems and Control Theory at the Center of Industrial Mathematics, University of Bremen.

Sufficient conditions of small-gain type are provided guaranteeing that the interconnection is ISS with respect to the external input. To this end we extend recently obtained small-gain theorems to a more general type of interconnections. The small-gain theorem provided here is applicable to situations where the ISS conditions are formulated differently for each subsystem and are either given in the maximization or the summation sense. Furthermore, it is shown that the conditions are compatible in the sense that it is always possible to transform sum formulations to maximum formulations without destroying a given small-gain condition. An example shows the advantages of our results in comparison with the known ones.","doi":"10.1109/TAC.2010.2080110","startPage":"1247","endPage":"1258","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/9/5784391/05585718.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAC.2010.2080110","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5784391","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Small-Gain Condition for Interconnections of ISS Systems With Mixed ISS Characterizations","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Stability criteria","Nonlinear systems","Indexes","Construction industry","Lyapunov method","Gain"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["interconnected systems","nonlinear control systems","optimisation","stability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["small-gain condition","ISS systems","ISS characterizations","interconnected nonlinear systems","sufficient conditions","small-gain type","small-gain theorems","maximization","summation sense","sum formulations","maximum formulations","input-to-state stable subsystems"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Control systems","large-scale systems","Lyapunov methods","nonlinear systems","stability criteria"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5585718/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 September 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2011","displayDocTitle":"A Small-Gain Condition for Interconnections of ISS Systems With Mixed ISS Characterizations","volume":"56","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/5585718/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","dateOfInsertion":"07 June 2011","accessionNumber":"12047061","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Small-Gain Condition for Interconnections of ISS Systems With Mixed ISS Characterizations","sourcePdf":"tac-dashkovskiy-2080110-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.085289S","chronDate":"June  2011","xplore-pub-id":"9","isNumber":"5784391","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9","citationCount":"37","xplore-issue":"5784391","articleId":"5585718","onlineDate":"27 September 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5585721,"authors":[{"name":"Angelia Nedic","affiliation":["Industrial and Enterprise Systems Engineering Department, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, IL, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/9/5784391/5585721/5585721-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Angelia Nedi\u0107 (M'07) received the B.S. degree from the University of Montenegro in 1987 and the M.S. degree from the University of Belgrade in 1990, both in mathematics.

We propose an asynchronous broadcast-based algorithm where the communications over the network are subject to random link failures. We investigate the convergence properties of the algorithm for a diminishing (random) stepsize and a constant stepsize, where each agent chooses its own stepsize independently of the other agents. Under some standard conditions on the gradient errors, we establish almost sure convergence of the method to an optimal point for diminishing stepsize. For constant stepsize, we establish some error bounds on the expected distance from the optimal point and the expected function value.

Though increasingly data-driven, emotion analysis still relies on critical expert knowledge in order to isolate the emotional keywords or keysets necessary to the construction of affective categories. This makes it vulnerable to any discrepancy between the ensuing taxonomy of affective states and the underlying domain of discourse. This paper proposes a more general framework, latent affective mapping, which exploits two separate levels of semantic information: the first one encapsulates the foundations of the domain considered, while the second one specifically accounts for the overall affective fabric of the language. Exposing the emergent relationship between these two levels advantageously steers the emotion classification process. Empirical evidence suggests that this approach is effective for automatic emotion analysis in text. This bodes well for its deployability toward naturally expressive speech synthesis.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5762410","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TASL.2010.2078808","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/10376/5762410/05585725.pdf","startPage":"1113","endPage":"1122","doi":"10.1109/TASL.2010.2078808","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Data-Driven Affective Analysis Framework Toward Naturally Expressive Speech Synthesis","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2011","displayDocTitle":"A Data-Driven Affective Analysis Framework Toward Naturally Expressive Speech Synthesis","volume":"19","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/5585725/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 2011","accessionNumber":"11972218","dateOfInsertion":"02 May 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5585725/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 September 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Data-Driven Affective Analysis Framework Toward Naturally Expressive Speech Synthesis","sourcePdf":"tasl-bellegarda-2078808-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.07651S","chronDate":"July  2011","xplore-pub-id":"10376","isNumber":"5762410","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10376","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"5762410","articleId":"5585725","onlineDate":"27 September 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5585726,"authors":[{"name":"Emily Mower","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Southern California, University Park, Los Angeles, California, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/10376/5762410/5585726/5585726-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Emily Mower (S'07) received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from Tufts University, Boston, MA, in 2004 and the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from the University of Southern California (USC), Los Angeles, in 2007.

Well-designed emotion recognition systems have the potential to augment HMI systems by providing additional user state details and by informing the design of emotionally relevant and emotionally targeted synthetic behavior. This paper describes an emotion classification paradigm, based on emotion profiles (EPs). This paradigm is an approach to interpret the emotional content of naturalistic human expression by providing multiple probabilistic class labels, rather than a single hard label. EPs provide an assessment of the emotion content of an utterance in terms of a set of simple categorical emotions: anger; happiness; neutrality; and sadness. This method can accurately capture the general emotional label (attaining an accuracy of 68.2% in our experiment on the IEMOCAP data) in addition to identifying underlying emotional properties of highly emotionally ambiguous utterances. This capability is beneficial when dealing with naturalistic human emotional expressions, which are often not well described by a single semantic label.","doi":"10.1109/TASL.2010.2076804","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TASL.2010.2076804","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5762410","startPage":"1057","endPage":"1070","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/10376/5762410/05585726.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5585726","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Feature extraction","Humans","Accuracy","Support vector machines","Databases","Eyebrows","Hidden Markov models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["emotion recognition","human computer interaction","image classification"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automatic human emotion classification","automatic emotion recognition","affect-sensitive human-machine interaction systems","HMI systems","emotion profiles","multiple probabilistic class labels","single hard label","human emotional expressions","single semantic label"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Emotion profiles","multimodal emotion classification","nonprototypical emotions"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Framework for Automatic Human Emotion Classification Using Emotion Profiles","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2011","isJournal":true,"volume":"19","issue":"5","publicationDate":"July 2011","accessionNumber":"11972219","dateOfInsertion":"02 May 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5585726/","isStaticHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 September 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5585726/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Framework for Automatic Human Emotion Classification Using Emotion Profiles","sourcePdf":"tasl-mower-2076804-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.08869S","chronDate":"July  2011","xplore-pub-id":"10376","isNumber":"5762410","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10376","citationCount":"126","xplore-issue":"5762410","articleId":"5585726","onlineDate":"27 September 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-25"},{"_id":5585733,"authors":[{"name":"Wei-Min Chao","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/76/5621670/5585733/5585733-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Wei-Min Chao was born in Taoyuan, Taiwan, in 1977.

This paper presents a novel pyramid architecture to efficiently process a system that the image pipeline is between an image sensor and video coding engine. By utilizing the features of the pyramid structure and block-based video/image encoders, the proposed architecture is scalable from low to high image resolution and filter size. The input image is first partitioned into floors of tiles to reduce the frame line buffer. Two computing schemes, immediate result reuse and vertical snack scan, are utilized to reduce the overlapping redundant computations. A 90 nm CMOS chip design with 7 \u00d7 5 filter support for 3840 \u00d7 2160 quad full high definition video at 30 frames/s is designed to demonstrate the performance of power and area efficiency. Compared with traditional architectures with frame line buffers, the proposed design has shown that the power consumption is reduced by 25% to 108 mW from 145 mW. The chip area is reduced by 65% to 309 K from 888 K logic gates. The external memory bandwidth increases to 8286 Mbit/s from 5972 Mbit/s for YUV4:2:0, from 7963 Mbit/s for YUV4:2:2, and is reduced by 30% from 11944 Mbit/s for YUV4:4:4.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/76/5621670/05585733.pdf","startPage":"1499","endPage":"1508","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","doi":"10.1109/TCSVT.2010.2077770","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSVT.2010.2077770","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5621670","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5585733","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Pyramid Architecture for 3840 X 2160 Quad Full High Definition 30 Frames/s Video Acquisition","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computer architecture","Pipelines","Streaming media","Image color analysis","Signal processing algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image resolution","image sensors","video coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["pyramid architecture","video acquisition","image pipeline processing","quality image","complementary metaloxide-semiconductor","charge-coupled device sensor","on-chip line buffer","power dissipation","filter window buffering","image resolution","image sensor","video coding engine","block-based video encoder","block-based image encoder","frame line buffer","vertical snack scan","CMOS chip design","quad full high definition video","logic gates","size 90 nm","power 108 mW to 145 mW"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Camcorder","digital image processing pipeline","digital still camera","high definition video","VLSI architecture"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5585733/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 September 2010","displayDocTitle":"Pyramid Architecture for 3840 X 2160 Quad Full High Definition 30 Frames/s Video Acquisition","volume":"20","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/5585733/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2010","accessionNumber":"11629514","dateOfInsertion":"04 November 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Pyramid Architecture for 3840 X 2160 Quad Full High Definition 30 Frames/s Video Acquisition","sourcePdf":"tcsvt-chao-2077770-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.082423S","chronDate":"Nov.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"76","isNumber":"5621670","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"5621670","articleId":"5585733","onlineDate":"27 September 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5585740,"authors":[{"name":"Kalyanmoy Deb","affiliation":["Department of Business Technology, School of Economics, Aalto University, Helsinki, Finland","Department of Mechanical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur, India"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4235/5592185/5585740/5585740-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Kalyanmoy Deb is currently the Deva Raj Chair Professor of Mechanical Engineering with the Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur, Kanpur, India.

The progress toward the most preferred solution is made by accepting preference based information progressively from the DM after every few generations of an evolutionary multiobjective optimization algorithm. This preference information is used to model a strictly monotone value function, which is used for the subsequent iterations of the evolutionary multiobjective optimization (EMO) algorithm. In addition to the development of the value function which satisfies DM's preference information, the proposed progressively interactive EMO-approach utilizes the constructed value function in directing EMO algorithm's search to more preferred solutions. This is accomplished using a preference-based domination principle and utilizing a preference-based termination criterion. Results on two- to five-objective optimization problems using the progressively interactive NSGA-II approach show the simplicity of the proposed approach and its future promise. A parametric study involving the algorithm's parameters reveals interesting insights of parameter interactions and indicates useful parameter values. A number of extensions to this paper are also suggested.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Delta modulation","Optimization","Decision making","Polynomials","Economics","Clustering algorithms","Probability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["evolutionary computation","iterative methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["interactive evolutionary multiobjective optimization method","approximated value functions","preference-based methodology","decision maker","monotone value function","subsequent iterations","preference-based domination principle","preference-based termination criterion","interactive NSGA-II approach"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Evolutionary multiobjective optimization (EMO) algorithms","interactive multiobjective optimization algorithm","multiple criteria decision-making","preference-based multiobjective optimization","sequential quadratic programming (SQP)"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5585740","doi":"10.1109/TEVC.2010.2064323","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation","pdfPath":"/iel5/4235/5592185/05585740.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEVC.2010.2064323","startPage":"723","endPage":"739","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5592185","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Interactive Evolutionary Multiobjective Optimization Method Based on Progressively Approximated Value Functions","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"An Interactive Evolutionary Multiobjective Optimization Method Based on Progressively Approximated Value Functions","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5585740/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 September 2010","volume":"14","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/5585740/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"30 September 2010","publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11559787","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Interactive Evolutionary Multiobjective Optimization Method Based on Progressively Approximated Value Functions","sourcePdf":"tevc-deb-2064323-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.092194S","chronDate":"Oct.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"4235","isNumber":"5592185","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4235","citationCount":"133","xplore-issue":"5592185","articleId":"5585740","onlineDate":"27 September 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5585742,"authors":[{"name":"J.P.

This regulator guarantees asymptotic tracking of time-varying references and rejection of disturbances while maintaining the closed-loop stability. Such a regulator is based on a continuous fuzzy error feedback controller, which updates its states at each sampling period and relies on the existence of an internal model. The internal model is obtained by determining, if possible, an observable generalized immersion of the exosystem dynamics. A key feature is that this immersion allows the generation of all the possible steady-state inputs for all admissible values of the system parameters. The robustness of the proposed fuzzy controller, under parameter uncertainties and changes on disturbance signals, is tested in an illustrative example.","doi":"10.1109/TFUZZ.2010.2079938","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TFUZZ.2010.2079938","startPage":"1170","endPage":"1177","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/91/5646375/05585742.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5646375","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Structurally Stable Output Regulation Problem With Sampled-Output Measurements Using Fuzzy Immersions","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 September 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2010","displayDocTitle":"Structurally Stable Output Regulation Problem With Sampled-Output Measurements Using Fuzzy Immersions","publicationDate":"Dec. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"29 November 2010","volume":"18","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"11670177","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5585742/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Structurally Stable Output Regulation Problem With Sampled-Output Measurements Using Fuzzy Immersions","sourcePdf":"tfuzz-castillotoledo-2079938-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.075086S","chronDate":"Dec.  2010","isNumber":"5646375","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"91","citationCount":"3","articleId":"5585742","onlineDate":"27 September 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-23"},{"_id":5585746,"authors":[{"name":"Xuesong Liu","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Fudan University, Shanghai, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/36/5695081/5585746/5585746-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Xuesong Liu received the B.S. degree from Fudan University, Shanghai, China, in 2008, where he is currently working toward the M.S. degree in the Department of Electronic Engineering.","His main research interests are hyperspectral image analysis, artificial neural networks, and image processing."]},"firstName":"Xuesong","lastName":"Liu","id":"37599931100"},{"name":"Wei Xia","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Fudan University, Shanghai, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/36/5695081/5585746/5585746-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Wei Xia received the B.E. degree from Shandong University, Shandong, China, in 2008.

However, the algorithm has a large amount of local minima due to the obvious nonconvexity of the objective function. In order to improve its performance, auxiliary constraints can be introduced into the algorithm. In this paper, we propose a new approach named abundance separation and smoothness constrained NMF by introducing two constraints, namely, abundance separation and smoothness, into the NMF algorithm. These constraints are based on two properties of hyperspectral imagery. First, usually, every ground object presents dominance in a specific region of the entire image scene and the correlation is weak between different endmembers. Second, moving through various regions, ground objects usually vary slowly and abrupt changes rarely appear. We also propose a learning algorithm to further improve the performance of our method, from which the auxiliary constraints are removed at an appropriate time. The proposed algorithm retains all the advantages of NMF and effectively overcomes the shortcoming of local minima at the same time. Experimental results based on synthetic and real hyperspectral data show the superiority of the proposed algorithm with respect to other state-of-the-art approaches.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5585746/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 September 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","publicationDate":"Feb. 2011","accessionNumber":"11769613","htmlLink":"/document/5585746/","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"49","issue":"2","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"An approach based on constrained nonnegative matrix factorization to unmix hyperspectral data","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An approach based on constrained nonnegative matrix factorization to unmix hyperspectral data","sourcePdf":"tgrs-wang-2068053-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.090547S","chronDate":"Feb.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"5695081","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"126","xplore-issue":"5695081","articleId":"5585746","onlineDate":"27 September 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":5585749,"authors":[{"name":"Philippe Godignon","affiliation":["National Center of Microelectronics IMB-CNM (CSIC), Barcelona, Spain"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/5873561/5585749/5585749-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Philippe Godignon was born in Lyon, France, in 1963.

Different endurance tests have been performed to evaluate the diode behavior when working at a high temperature and under severe thermal cycling conditions (ranged from -170 \u00b0C to 270 \u00b0C). The radiation hardness capability has been also tested. It has been found that the hermeticity of the package in a neutral atmosphere is a key aspect to avoid an electrical parameter drift. Moreover, the use of gold metallization and gold wire bonds on the anode allows reducing the diode surface and bonding degradation when compared to Al-containing technology. On the back-side cathode contact, the Ti/Ni/Au metallization and AuGe combination have shown a very good behavior. As a result, the manufactured diodes demonstrated high stability for a continuous operation at 285 \u00b0C.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/5873561/05585749.pdf","startPage":"2582","endPage":"2590","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"SiC Schottky Diodes for Harsh Environment Space Applications","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2010.2080252","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5873561","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2010.2080252","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5585749","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5585749/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 September 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2011","displayDocTitle":"SiC Schottky Diodes for Harsh Environment Space Applications","dateOfInsertion":"13 June 2011","publicationDate":"July 2011","accessionNumber":"12049318","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"58","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/5585749/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SiC Schottky Diodes for Harsh Environment Space Applications","sourcePdf":"tie-godignon-2080252-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.064295S","chronDate":"July  2011","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"5873561","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"72","xplore-issue":"5873561","articleId":"5585749","onlineDate":"27 September 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5585756,"authors":[{"name":"S.

Accurate estimation of the sub-pixel motion between the LR images significantly affects the performance of the reconstructed HR image. In this paper, we propose novel super resolution methods where the HR image and the motion parameters are estimated simultaneously. Utilizing a Bayesian formulation, we model the unknown HR image, the acquisition process, the motion parameters and the unknown model parameters in a stochastic sense. Employing a variational Bayesian analysis, we develop two novel algorithms which jointly estimate the distributions of all unknowns. The proposed framework has the following advantages: 1) Through the incorporation of uncertainty of the estimates, the algorithms prevent the propagation of errors between the estimates of the various unknowns; 2) the algorithms are robust to errors in the estimation of the motion parameters; and 3) using a fully Bayesian formulation, the developed algorithms simultaneously estimate all algorithmic parameters along with the HR image and motion parameters, and therefore they are fully-automated and do not require parameter tuning. We also show that the proposed motion estimation method is a stochastic generalization of the classical Lucas-Kanade registration algorithm. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approaches are very effective and compare favorably to state-of-the-art SR algorithms.","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2010.2080278","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/83/5733951/05585756.pdf","startPage":"984","endPage":"999","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2010.2080278","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5733951","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Variational Bayesian Super Resolution","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5585756","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 September 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5585756/","displayDocTitle":"Variational Bayesian Super Resolution","volume":"20","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 2011","accessionNumber":"11874757","pubMedId":"20876021","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5585756/","dateOfInsertion":"17 March 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Variational Bayesian Super Resolution","sourcePdf":"tip-babacan-2080278-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.137043S","chronDate":"April  2011","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"5733951","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"172","xplore-issue":"5733951","articleId":"5585756","onlineDate":"27 September 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-27"},{"_id":5585760,"authors":[{"name":"Nikolaos Stamatopoulos","affiliation":["Institute of Informatics and Telecommunications, National Center for Scientific Research Demokritos, Athens, Greece"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/83/5733951/5585760/5585760-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Nikolaos Stamatopoulos was born in Athens, Grecce in 1984.

In this paper, we present a goal-oriented rectification methodology to compensate for undesirable document image distortions aiming to improve the OCR result. Our approach relies upon a coarse-to-fine strategy. First, a coarse rectification is accomplished with the aid of a computationally low cost transformation which addresses the projection of a curved surface to a 2-D rectangular area. The projection of the curved surface on the plane is guided only by the textual content's appearance in the document image while incorporating a transformation which does not depend on specific model primitives or camera setup parameters. Second, pose normalization is applied on the word level aiming to restore all the local distortions of the document image. Experimental results on various document images with a variety of distortions demonstrate the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed rectification methodology using a consistent evaluation methodology that encounters OCR accuracy and a newly introduced measure using a semi-automatic procedure.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image

The spline formalism offers an attractive framework for solving this problem; the currently available methods, however, are hard to deploy for large-scale interpolation problems in dimensions greater than two (3-D, 3-D+time) because of an exponential increase of their computational cost (curse of dimensionality). Here, we revisit the standard regularized least-squares formulation of the interpolation problem, and propose to perform the reconstruction in a uniform tensor-product B-spline basis as an alternative to the classical solution involving radial basis functions. Our analysis reveals that the underlying multilinear system of equations admits a tensor decomposition with an extreme sparsity of its one dimensional components. We exploit this property for implementing a parallel, memory-efficient system solver. We show that the computational complexity of the proposed algorithm is essentially linear in the number of measurements and that its dependency on the number of dimensions is significantly less than that of the original sparse matrix-based implementation. The net benefit is a substantial reduction in memory requirement and operation count when compared to standard matrix-based algorithms, so that even 4-D problems with millions of samples become computationally feasible on desktop PCs in reasonable time. After validating the proposed algorithm in 3-D and 4-D, we apply it to a concrete imaging problem: the reconstruction of medical ultrasound images (3-D+time) from a large set of irregularly sampled measurements, acquired by a fast rotating ultrasound transducer.","doi":"10.1109/TMI.2010.2078832","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMI.2010.2078832","startPage":"366","endPage":"374","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","pdfPath":"/iel5/42/5705633/05585770.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5705633","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reconstruction of Large, Irregularly Sampled Multidimensional Images.

Different from traditional Euclidean distance, which is constrained by the orthogonality assumption, TD measures the distance between data points by considering the relationships among different coordinates. To preserve the natural tensor structure in low-dimensional space, MLPMIE directly works on the high-order form of input data and iteratively learns the transformation matrices. In order to preserve the local geometry and to maximize the global discrimination simultaneously, MLPMIE keeps both local and global structures in a manifold model. By integrating TD into tensor embedding, TD-MLPMIE performs tensor-based DR through the whole learning procedure, and achieves stable performance improvement on various standard datasets.","doi":"10.1109/TNN.2010.2066574","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/72/5617343/05585773.pdf","startPage":"1848","endPage":"1854","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5617343","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNN.2010.2066574","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5585773","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Tensor Distance Based Multilinear Locality-Preserved Maximum Information Embedding","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5585773/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 September 2010","displayDocTitle":"Tensor Distance Based Multilinear Locality-Preserved Maximum Information Embedding","volume":"21","issue":"11","accessionNumber":"11623355","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"01 November 2010","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2010","pubMedId":"20876016","htmlLink":"/document/5585773/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Tensor Distance Based Multilinear Locality-Preserved Maximum Information Embedding","sourcePdf":"tnn-liu-2066574-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.094611S","chronDate":"Nov.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"72","isNumber":"5617343","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"45","xplore-issue":"5617343","articleId":"5585773","onlineDate":"27 September 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5585774,"authors":[{"name":"Fei-Yue Wang","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Complex Systems and Intelligence Science, Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy and Sciences, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/72/5680555/5585774/5585774-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Fei-Yue Wang (S'87\u2013M'89\u2013S'94\u2013F'03) received the Ph.D. degree in computer and systems engineering from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Troy, NY, in 1990.","He joined the University of Arizona, Tuscon, in 1990, and became a Professor and Director of the Robotics and Automation Laboratory and the Program for Advanced Research in Complex Systems.

SWAT merges the Bienenstock-Cooper-Munro (BCM) learning rule with spike timing dependent plasticity (STDP). The STDP/BCM rule yields a unimodal weight distribution where the height of the plasticity window associated with STDP is modulated causing stability after a period of training. The SNN uses a single training neuron in the training phase where data associated with all classes is passed to this neuron. The rule then maps weights to the classifying output neurons to reflect similarities in the data across the classes. The SNN also includes both excitatory and inhibitory facilitating synapses which create a frequency routing capability allowing the information presented to the network to be routed to different hidden layer neurons. A variable neuron threshold level simulates the refractory period. SWAT is initially benchmarked against the nonlinearly separable Iris and Wisconsin Breast Cancer datasets. Results presented show that the proposed training algorithm exhibits a convergence accuracy of 95.5% and 96.2% for the Iris and Wisconsin training sets, respectively, and 95.3% and 96.7% for the testing sets, noise experiments show that SWAT has a good generalization capability. SWAT is also benchmarked using an isolated digit automatic speech recognition (ASR) system where a subset of the TI46 speech corpus is used. Results show that with SWAT as the classifier, the ASR system provides an accuracy of 98.875% for training and 95.25% for testing.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/72/5617343/05585775.pdf","startPage":"1817","endPage":"1830","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","doi":"10.1109/TNN.2010.2074212","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNN.2010.2074212","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5617343","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5585775","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"SWAT: A Spiking Neural Network Training Algorithm for Classification Problems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neurons","Topology","Frequency shift keying","Network topology","Benchmark testing","Automatic speech recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cancer","learning (artificial intelligence)","medical computing","pattern classification","speech recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["SWAT","spiking neural network training algorithm","classification problems","synaptic weight association training algorithm","SNN","Bienenstock-Cooper-Munro learning rule","BCM learning rule","spike timing dependent plasticity window","STDP","unimodal weight distribution","frequency routing capability","variable neuron threshold level","Wisconsin breast cancer datasets","iris datasets","isolated digit automatic speech recognition system","TI46 speech corpus","ASR system"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Automatic speech recognition","Bienenstock\u2013Cooper\u2014Munro","dynamic synapses","spike timing dependent plasticity","spiking neural networks"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Action Potentials","Algorithms","Artificial Intelligence","Brain","Computer Simulation","Nerve Net","Neural Networks (Computer)","Neuronal Plasticity","Neurons","Pattern Recognition, Automated","Plant Extracts","Software Design","Speech Recognition Software","Synaptic Transmission","Teaching"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5585775/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 September 2010","displayDocTitle":"SWAT: A Spiking Neural Network Training Algorithm for Classification Problems","volume":"21","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/5585775/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2010","accessionNumber":"11623351","pubMedId":"20876015","dateOfInsertion":"01 November 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SWAT: A Spiking Neural Network Training Algorithm for Classification Problems","sourcePdf":"tnn-wade-2074212-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.116708S","chronDate":"Nov.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"72","isNumber":"5617343","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"91","xplore-issue":"5617343","articleId":"5585775","onlineDate":"27 September 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5585778,"authors":[{"name":"Audrey S.

However, noninvasive BCIs have not been able to demonstrate such mastery of 3-D space. Here, we report our work, which demonstrates that human subjects can use a noninvasive BCI to fly a virtual helicopter to any point in a 3-D world. Through use of intelligent control strategies, we have facilitated the realization of controlled flight in 3-D space. We accomplished this through a reductionist approach that assigns subject-specific control signals to the crucial components of 3-D flight. Subject control of the helicopter was comparable when using either the BCI or a keyboard. By using intelligent control strategies, the strengths of both the user and the BCI system were leveraged and accentuated. Intelligent control strategies in BCI systems such as those presented here may prove to be the foundation for complex BCIs capable of doing more than we ever imagined.","doi":"10.1109/TNSRE.2010.2077654","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Systems and Rehabilitation Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Systems and Rehabilitation Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/7333/5658599/05585778.pdf","startPage":"581","endPage":"589","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNSRE.2010.2077654","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5658599","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"EEG Control of a Virtual Helicopter in 3-Dimensional Space Using Intelligent Control Strategies","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5585778","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 September 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5585778/","displayDocTitle":"EEG Control of a Virtual Helicopter in 3-Dimensional Space Using Intelligent Control Strategies","volume":"18","issue":"6","publicationDate":"Dec. 2010","accessionNumber":"11692546","pubMedId":"20876032","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5585778/","dateOfInsertion":"06 December 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"EEG Control of a Virtual Helicopter in 3-Dimensional Space Using Intelligent Control Strategies","sourcePdf":"tnsre-he-2077654-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.062052S","chronDate":"Dec.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"7333","isNumber":"5658599","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7333","citationCount":"135","xplore-issue":"5658599","articleId":"5585778","onlineDate":"27 September 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5585779,"authors":[{"name":"Sang Wook Lee","affiliation":["Department of Biomedical Engineering, Catholic University of America, Washington D.C., DC, USA","Center of Applied Biomechanics and Rehabilitation Research, National Rehabilitation Hospital, Washington D.C., DC, USA","Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago, IL, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7333/6036729/5585779/5585779-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Sang Wook Lee received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in mechanical design and production engineering from Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea, in 1997 and 1999, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in mechanical engineering from University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, in 2006.","He was a postdoctoral research fellow at the Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago, Chicago, IL, from 2006 to 2010.

These classifications will enable volitional control of assistive devices, thereby improving their functionality. Twenty subjects with chronic hemiparesis participated in the study. Subjects were instructed to perform six functional tasks while their muscle activation patterns were recorded by ten surface electrodes placed on the forearm and hand of the impaired limb. In order to identify intended functional tasks, a pattern classifier using linear discriminant analysis was applied to the EMG feature vectors. The classification accuracy was mainly affected by the impairment level of the subject. Mean classification accuracy was 71.3% for moderately impaired subjects (Chedoke Stage of Hand 4 and 5), and 37.9% for severely impaired subjects (Chedoke Stage of Hand 2 and 3). Most misclassification occurred between grip tasks of similar nature, for example, among pinch, key, and three-fingered grips, or between cylindrical and spherical grips. EMG signals from the intrinsic hand muscles significantly contributed to the inter-task variability of the feature vectors, as assessed by the inter-task squared Euclidean distance, thereby indicating the importance of intrinsic hand muscles in functional manual tasks. This study demonstrated the feasibility of the EMG pattern classification technique to discern the intent of stroke survivors. Future work should concentrate on the construction of a subject-specific EMG classification paradigm that carefully considers both functional and physiological impairment characteristics of each subject in the target task selection and electrode placement procedures.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Systems and Rehabilitation Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/7333/6036729/05585779.pdf","startPage":"558","endPage":"566","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Systems and Rehabilitation Engineering","doi":"10.1109/TNSRE.2010.2079334","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNSRE.2010.2079334","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6036729","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5585779","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Subject-Specific Myoelectric Pattern Classification of Functional Hand Movements for Stroke Survivors","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Muscles","Electromyography","Training","Accuracy","Electrodes","Fingers","Pattern classification"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electromyography","medical disorders","medical signal processing","pattern classification"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["subject-specific myoelectric pattern classification","functional hand movements","stroke survivors","electromyography","muscle activation patterns","volitional control","assistive devices","chronic hemiparesis","surface electrodes","linear discriminant analysis","EMG feature vectors","classification accuracy","grip tasks","Euclidean distance"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Electromyography (EMG)","functional task","hand","pattern classification","stroke"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Aged","Algorithms","Electrodes","Electromyography","Electromyography","Feasibility Studies","Female","Hand","Hand Strength","Humans","Male","Middle Aged","Movement","Paresis","Psychomotor Performance","Stroke","Stroke","Survivors"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5585779/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 September 2010","displayDocTitle":"Subject-Specific Myoelectric Pattern Classification of Functional Hand Movements for Stroke Survivors","volume":"19","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/5585779/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12288272","pubMedId":"20876030","dateOfInsertion":"10 October 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Subject-Specific Myoelectric Pattern Classification of Functional Hand Movements for Stroke Survivors","sourcePdf":"tnsre-lee-2079334-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.070516S","chronDate":"Oct.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"7333","isNumber":"6036729","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7333","citationCount":"84","xplore-issue":"6036729","articleId":"5585779","onlineDate":"27 September 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5585782,"authors":[{"name":"Qingchun Zhang","affiliation":["Cree Research, Inc., NC, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/5675792/5585782/5585782-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Qingchun (Jon) Zhang received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in 1992 and 1997, respectively, from Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from the University of South Carolina, Columbia, in 2001.","He joined the SiC power device research (diodes, JFETs, UMOSFETs, GTOs) at Rockwell Scientific Company, Thousand Oaks, CA, in 2001.

Waveform and ripple of the winding current in a coupled inductor converter can be easily determined using the developed model similar to those obtained in an uncoupled inductor converter. Influence of coupling coefficient on converter steady state and transient performance is readily predicted by the proposed model.

Performance is evaluated by simulation so that comparison can be made with known optimal coherent/differential detection. Compared with known decision-directed Kalman-based estimation and two pilot-aided OFDM schemes (block pilots and comb pilots), the presented technique performs better for regions with mid to high signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). Its robustness to the time variation of the channel is also quantified by simulation, showing only small degradation in performance relative to the quasistatic case of wireless local area network (WLAN) systems.

It is shown that frequency diversity inherent in a frequency-selective fading channel can be extracted and exploited by the proposed FSFD-MMSE receiver. This diversity advantage outweighs the effect of intercarrier interference generated by frequency-domain oversampling, due largely to the MMSE receiver's interference suppression capability. Numerical results show that the FSFD-MMSE receiver outperforms the conventional MMSE receiver under both ideal and practical situations (i.e., with frequency offset, channel estimation errors, and even doubly selective channel fading). In addition, the FSFD-MMSE receiver only needs a fast Fourier transform size that is no larger than N + Q -1 (TV = number of data subcarriers, and Q = number of resolvable multipath components).","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/5613993/05585796.pdf","startPage":"4400","endPage":"4407","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2010.2078846","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2010.2078846","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5613993","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5585796","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fractionally Spaced Frequency-Domain MMSE Receiver for OFDM Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Mean square error methods","Frequency domain analysis","Channel estimation","Bit error rate","Frequency diversity","Fading"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Bayes methods","channel estimation","diversity reception","fading channels","fast Fourier transforms","interference suppression","least mean squares methods","OFDM modulation","radio receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frequency-domain oversampling","Bayesian Gauss-Markov theorem","fractionally spaced frequency-domain minimum mean-square error","orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing","frequency diversity","frequency-selective fading channel","intercarrier interference","interference suppression","doubly selective channel fading","channel estimation errors","fast Fourier transform"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Doubly selective fading","frequency-domain oversampling","minimum mean square error (MMSE) receiver","orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5585796/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 September 2010","displayDocTitle":"Fractionally Spaced Frequency-Domain MMSE Receiver for OFDM Systems","volume":"59","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/5585796/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2010","accessionNumber":"11630039","dateOfInsertion":"09 November 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fractionally Spaced Frequency-Domain MMSE Receiver for OFDM Systems","sourcePdf":"tvt-liu-2078846-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.07538S","chronDate":"Nov.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"5613993","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"5613993","articleId":"5585796","onlineDate":"27 September 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5585799,"authors":[{"name":"Chang-Yi Yang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, National Penghu University of Science and Technology, Penghu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chang-Yi","lastName":"Yang","id":"37984647100"},{"name":"Bor-Sen Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Bor-Sen","lastName":"Chen","id":"37280633300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9545"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1939-9359"}],"articleNumber":"5585799","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":509},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Vehicular Technology Society","url":"http://www.vtsociety.org/"}],"abstract":"An unscented Kalman filter (UKF)-based channel-tracking method is proposed for a fast time-varying multipath fading channel in a multicarrier code-division multiple-access (MC-CDMA) system. The mobile radio channel is modeled as an autoregressive (AR) random process. The parameters of the AR process and the channel gain are simultaneously estimated by the proposed method. One-step-ahead prediction can also be obtained during channel estimation. It is useful for the decision-directed channel-tracking design, particularly in the fast-fading channel. Meanwhile, the estimated parameters can enhance the minimum mean-square error (MMSE) equalizer for symbol detection.

The level of the clock frequency of the combined pulse train of the two polarizations is proposed as the error signal for the PMDC. It enables the PMDC to work in the cancellation mode. Two separate control loops are proposed for the polarization de-multiplexer and the PMDC to allow them to work independently.

We analyze a dynamic coalition formation game based on a Markovian model for the spectrum sharing problem in an interference channel. Our model is dynamic in the sense that distributed transmitter/receiver pairs, with partial channel knowledge, reach stable coalition structures (CSs) through a time-evolving sequence of steps. Depending on an interference environment, we show that the game process either converges to the absorbing state of the grand coalition or to the absorbing state of internal and external stability. We also show that, due to myopic links, it is possible that the core of the game is nonempty, but links cannot form the grand coalition to utilize the core rate allocations. We then formulate a condition for the formation of the stable grand coalition. Using simulation we show that coalition formation yields significant gains in terms of average rates per link for different network sizes. We also show average maximum coalition sizes for different distances between the transmitters and their own receivers. Finally, we analyze the mean and variance of the time for the game to reach the stable coalition structures.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCIAIG.2010.2080358","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5730536","startPage":"17","endPage":"30","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computational Intelligence and AI in Games","pdfPath":"/iel5/4804728/5730536/05585818.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modeling the Dynamics of Coalition Formation Games for Cooperative Spectrum Sharing in an Interference Channel","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5585818/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 September 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5585818/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Modeling the Dynamics of Coalition Formation Games for Cooperative Spectrum Sharing in an Interference Channel","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2011","accessionNumber":"11873151","dateOfInsertion":"14 March 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"3","issue":"1","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modeling the Dynamics of Coalition Formation Games for Cooperative Spectrum Sharing in an Interference Channel","sourcePdf":"tciaig-khan-2080358-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.077589S","chronDate":"March  2011","xplore-pub-id":"4804728","isNumber":"5730536","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4804728","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"5730536","articleId":"5585818","onlineDate":"27 September 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5585822,"authors":[{"name":"Gustavo D.

Typically, the Montgomery's modular-multiplication algorithm is used since no trial division is necessary, and the carry-save addition (CSA) is employed to reduce the critical path. In this paper, we optimize the Montgomery's multiplication and propose architectures to perform the least significant bit first and the most significant bit first algorithms. The developed architecture has the following distinctive characteristics: 1) use of digit serial approach for Montgomery multiplication. 2) Conversion of the CSA representation of intermediate multiplication using carry-skip addition. This allows the critical path to be reduced, albeit with a small-area speed penalty; and 3) precompute the quotient value in Montgomery's iteration in order to speed up the operating frequency. In this paper, we present results in Xilinx Virtex 5 and in 0.18-\u03bcm application-specified integrated circuit technologies. For fair comparison with previous works, Xilinx Virtex 2 results are reported. Experimental results show that the proposed modular exponentiation and modular-multiplication design obtain the best delay performance compared with the published works and outperform them in terms of area-time complexity as well.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5873561","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/5873561/05585822.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2010.2080653","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2010.2080653","startPage":"3101","endPage":"3109","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modular Multiplication and Exponentiation Architectures for Fast RSA Cryptosystem Based on Digit Serial Computation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 September 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5585822/","displayDocTitle":"Modular Multiplication and Exponentiation Architectures for Fast RSA Cryptosystem Based on Digit Serial Computation","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5585822/","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"58","issue":"7","accessionNumber":"12049322","dateOfInsertion":"13 June 2011","publicationDate":"July 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modular Multiplication and Exponentiation Architectures for Fast RSA Cryptosystem Based on Digit Serial Computation","sourcePdf":"tie-sutter-2080653-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.09382S","chronDate":"July  2011","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"5873561","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"52","xplore-issue":"5873561","articleId":"5585822","onlineDate":"27 September 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5585823,"authors":[{"name":"Hui-Yu Huang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, National Formosa University, Yunlin, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/10206/5623286/5585823/5585823-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Hui-Yu Huang (M'05) received the B.S. degree in electronic engineering from Feng Chia University, Taiwan, in 1992, the M.S. degree in electrical and computer engineering from Yuan-Ze University, in 1994, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from National Tsing Hua University, Taiwan, in 2002.","Since 2005, she has been with the Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, National Formosa University, Taiwan, where she is now an Assistant Professor.

And people are very aware for media ownership. However, digital watermarking is an efficient and promising means to protect intellectual properties. Based on the intellectual property attention in the information era, how to protect the personal ownership is extremely important and a necessary scheme. In this paper, we propose an effective video watermarking method based on a pseudo-3-D discrete cosine transform (DCT) and quantization index modulation (QIM) against several attacks. The watermark is mainly inserted into the uncompressed domain by adjusting the correlation between DCT coefficients of the selected blocks, and the watermark extraction is blind. This approach consists of a pseudo-3-D DCT, watermark embedding, and extraction. A pseudo-3-D DCT, which is taken DCT transformation twice, will be first utilized to calculate the embedding factor and to obtain the useful messages. Using the QIM, we embed the watermark into the quantization regions from the successive raw frames in the uncompressed domain and record the relative information to create a secret embedding key. This secret embedding key will further apply to extraction. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can survive filtering, compressions, luminance change, and noise attacks with a good invisibility and robustness.","doi":"10.1109/TIFS.2010.2080675","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security","pdfPath":"/iel5/10206/5623286/05585823.pdf","startPage":"625","endPage":"637","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIFS.2010.2080675","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5623286","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Video Watermarking Technique Based on Pseudo-3-D DCT and Quantization Index Modulation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5585823","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 September 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5585823/","displayDocTitle":"A Video Watermarking Technique Based on Pseudo-3-D DCT and Quantization Index Modulation","volume":"5","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Dec. 2010","accessionNumber":"11641616","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5585823/","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Video Watermarking Technique Based on Pseudo-3-D DCT and Quantization Index Modulation","sourcePdf":"tifs-huang-2080675-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.068623S","chronDate":"Dec.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"10206","isNumber":"5623286","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10206","citationCount":"66","xplore-issue":"5623286","articleId":"5585823","onlineDate":"27 September 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5585828,"authors":[{"name":"Hai Chen","affiliation":["Integrated System Design Laboratory (ISDL), Texas Analog Center of Excellence (TxACE), University of Texas, Dallas, Richardson, TX, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/5675792/5585828/5585828-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Hai Chen (M'10) received the B.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China, in 2004 and 2009, respectively.","He is currently a Visiting Research Scientist at the University of Texas at Dallas, Richardson.

The system employs supercapacitors to form a multienergy-source structure, and thus features multidirectional power delivery capability, which in turn allows the implementation of such state-of-the-art power management techniques as dynamic voltage scaling (DVS). A global energy management strategy is introduced to realize appropriate energy delivery, with the aid of a power management unit consisting of several proposed power converters that are capable of bidirectional operation. The bidirectional operation also dramatically increases the tracking speed during DVS with a charge-recycle technique. Fabrication of supercapacitor featuring compatibility with the CMOS process is also discussed, focusing on the preparation of free-standing single-walled carbon nanotube (CNT) films directly on a Si substrate, as electrodes for supercapacitor.

The proposed control strategies arise from a parallelism between steering and vertical dynamics of a motorcycle. According to this parallelism, the Sky-Hook (SH) and Ground-Hook (GH) damping concepts are adapted to the control of steering dynamics. A detailed analysis of the two approaches shows that a tradeoff arises between the damping of wobble and weave mode. It is then shown that the tradeoff can be solved by mixing the SH and GH strategies according to a frequency-range selector. The closed-loop stability properties are investigated via passivity theory. Further, both a multibody simulator and experimental data are employed to validate both the modeling phase and the control strategies performance.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5585841/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 September 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5585841/","dateOfInsertion":"15 August 2011","publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12205986","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"19","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Semi-Active Steering Damper Control in Two-Wheeled Vehicles","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Semi-Active Steering Damper Control in Two-Wheeled Vehicles","sourcePdf":"tcst-tanelli-2070068-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.097088S","chronDate":"Sept.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"87","isNumber":"5983465","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"87","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"5983465","articleId":"5585841","onlineDate":"27 September 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5585845,"authors":[{"name":"Eszter Udvary","affiliation":["Department of Broadband Infocommunication Systems, Budapest University\uc2a0of\uc2a0Technology\uc2a0and\uc2a0Economics, Budapest, Hungary"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/5629952/5585845/5585845-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Eszter Udvary (S'98\u2013M'07) received the M.Sc. and PhD. degrees in telecommunication engineering from the Budapest University of Technology and Economics (BME), Budapest, Hungary.","She is currently, an Associate Professor with BME.

By adopting simple statistical models for anomalous and background traffic in the time domain, one can estimate model parameters in real time, thus obviating the need for a long training phase or manual parameter tuning. The proposed bivariate parametric detection mechanism (bPDM) uses a sequential probability ratio test, allowing for control over the false positive rate while examining the tradeoff between detection time and the strength of an anomaly. Additionally, it uses both traffic-rate and packet-size statistics, yielding a bivariate model that eliminates most false positives. The method is analyzed using the bit-rate signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) metric, which is shown to be an effective metric for anomaly detection. The performance of the bPDM is evaluated in three ways. First, synthetically generated traffic provides for a controlled comparison of detection time as a function of the anomalous level of traffic. Second, the approach is shown to be able to detect controlled artificial attacks over the University of Southern California (USC), Los Angeles, campus network in varying real traffic mixes. Third, the proposed algorithm achieves rapid detection of real denial-of-service attacks as determined by the replay of previously captured network traces. The method developed in this paper is able to detect all attacks in these scenarios in a few seconds or less.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 September 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5585849/","volume":"19","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/5585849/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11960320","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 2011","dateOfInsertion":"15 April 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Parametric Methods for Anomaly Detection in Aggregate Traffic","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Parametric Methods for Anomaly Detection in Aggregate Traffic","sourcePdf":"tnet-thatte-2070845-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.122912S","chronDate":"April  2011","xplore-pub-id":"90","isNumber":"5750164","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"90","citationCount":"93","xplore-issue":"5750164","articleId":"5585849","onlineDate":"27 September 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5585851,"authors":[{"name":"D\u00e9bora Matos","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul, Porto Alegre, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/92/6017244/5585851/5585851-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["D\u00e9bora Matos (S'08) was born in Pelotas-RS, Brazil.

However, setting all parameters, such as buffer size, at design time can cause either excessive power dissipation (originated by router under utilization), or a higher latency. The situation worsens whenever the application changes its communication pattern, e.g., a portable phone downloads a new service. Large buffer sizes can ensure performance during the execution of different applications, but unfortunately, these same buffers are mainly responsible for the router total power dissipation. Another aspect is that by sizing buffers for the worst case latency incurs extra dissipation for the mean case, which is much more frequent. In this paper we propose the use of a reconfigurable router, where the buffer slots are dynamically allocated to increase router efficiency in an NoC, even under rather different communication loads. In the proposed architecture, the depth of each buffer word used in the input channels of the routers can be reconfigured at run time. The reconfigurable router allows up to 52% power savings, while maintaining the same performance as that of a homogeneous router, but using a 64% smaller buffer size.","doi":"10.1109/TVLSI.2010.2068064","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/92/6017244/05585851.pdf","startPage":"2045","endPage":"2057","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVLSI.2010.2068064","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6017244","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reconfigurable Routers for Low Power and High Performance","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5585851","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 September 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5585851/","displayDocTitle":"Reconfigurable Routers for Low Power and High Performance","volume":"19","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 2011","accessionNumber":"12228017","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5585851/","dateOfInsertion":"12 September 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reconfigurable Routers for Low Power and High Performance","sourcePdf":"tvlsi-matos-2068064-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.081657S","chronDate":"Nov.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"6017244","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"6017244","articleId":"5585851","onlineDate":"27 September 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5585913,"authors":[{"name":"Paul Walsh","affiliation":["Computing Department, Cork Institute of Technology, Cork, Ireland"],"firstName":"Paul","lastName":"Walsh","id":"37269444300"},{"name":"Prasad Gade","affiliation":["Computing Department, Cork Institute of Technology, Cork, Ireland"],"firstName":"Prasad","lastName":"Gade","id":"37705857200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6911-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6909-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6910-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-778X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0026"}],"articleNumber":"5585913","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":572},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5585913","abstract":"This paper introduces the Auto Terrain Generation System (ATGS), which is based on an Interactive Genetic Algorithm (IGA) that enables non-specialist users to rapidly generate terrains. The motivation for using an IGA is discussed, existing terrain generation techniques are described and a new approach, based on a fractal terrain engine, is outlined. Graphics engines allow terrains to be specified with over 800 floating point parameters, which can overwhelm non-specialist users. These parameters also create a vast search space for auto-terrain generation systems that can complicate procedural techniques. ATGS addresses these issues via interaction with the user, which is implemented in ATGS by a web based user interface that allows users to rapidly indicate terrain preferences. These user preferences are used by a genetic algorithm to explore a multi-dimensional parameter space that satisfies the user's intuition and aesthetics. Proof of concept experiments are outlined, results are presented and future research work is projected.","doi":"10.1109/CEC.2010.5585913","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","pdfPath":"/iel5/5573635/5585910/05585913.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CEC.2010.5585913","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5585910","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Terrain generation using an Interactive Genetic Algorithm","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Clouds","Sun","Games","User interfaces","Graphics","Biological cells","Engines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer graphics","fractals","genetic algorithms","interactive systems","terrain mapping","user interfaces"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["interactive genetic algorithm","auto terrain generation system","fractal terrain engine","graphics engines","floating point parameters","Web based user interface","multidimensional parameter space"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5585913/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-23 July 2010","displayDocTitle":"Terrain generation using an Interactive Genetic Algorithm","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5585913/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2010","dateOfInsertion":"27 September 2010","conferenceDate":"18-23 July 2010","accessionNumber":"11567688","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Terrain generation using an Interactive Genetic Algorithm","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"C7410.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048901S","chronDate":"18-23 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5573635","isNumber":"5585910","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5573635","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"5585910","articleId":"5585913","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5585924,"authors":[{"name":"Tak-Ming Chan","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shatin, N.

In this paper, we propose Genetic Algorithm (GA) for Spaced Motifs Elicitation on Nucleotides (GASMEN), which searches from a wide range of possible widths (4-25) and relaxes substantial constraints. GASMEN employs submotif indexing to partition the search space into smaller sub-space for GA to easier reach optimality. Multiple-motif control is employed and probabilistic refinements are proposed to improve motif quality respectively. The preliminary results on real spaced motifs demonstrate that GASMEN is promising to find more accurate motifs and optimal widths, compared with the state-of-the-art method, SPACE.

The results are also compared with Bayesian Optimization Algorithm, a well-known evolutionary optimizer, to demonstrate this improvement.","doi":"10.1109/CEC.2010.5585936","pdfPath":"/iel5/5573635/5585910/05585936.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","publicationTitle":"IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CEC.2010.5585936","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5585910","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Enhancing the efficiency of genetic algorithm by identifying linkage groups using DSM clustering","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5585936/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-23 July 2010","displayDocTitle":"Enhancing the efficiency of genetic algorithm by identifying linkage groups using DSM clustering","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"27 September 2010","accessionNumber":"11567740","publicationDate":"July 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5585936/","conferenceDate":"18-23 July 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Enhancing the efficiency of genetic algorithm by identifying linkage groups using DSM clustering","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"C7878.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.081384S","chronDate":"18-23 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5573635","isNumber":"5585910","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5573635","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5585910","articleId":"5585936","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":5585939,"authors":[{"name":"Andreas T Ernst","affiliation":["Mathematics, Informatics and Statistics, CSIRO, Clayton, VIC, Australia"],"firstName":"Andreas T","lastName":"Ernst","id":"37268484700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6911-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6909-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6910-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-778X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0026"}],"articleNumber":"5585939","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":286},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Particle swarm optimization","Encoding","Heuristic algorithms","Construction industry","Upper bound","Optimization","Search problems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","constraint handling","heuristic programming","particle swarm optimisation","trees (mathematics)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hybrid Lagrangian particle swarm optimization algorithm","degree constrained minimum spanning tree problem","Lagrangian heuristic","Wedelin","combinatorial Lagrangian particle swarm optimization algorithm","dual space","primal space","cost perturbation","CoLaPSO method","NP hard problem"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents a new hybrid heuristic combining particle swarm optimization with a Lagrangian heuristic along the lines first proposed by Wedelin.

It uses a problem representations that works simultaneously in the dual space (Lagrangian multipliers) and the primal space in the form of cost perturbations. The CoLaPSO method is applied to solving the degree constrained minimum spanning tree problem. This NP-hard problem consists of finding a minimum cost spanning tree on a graph such that none of the vertices is connected to more than a fixed number of edges. The hybrid heuristic inherits from the Lagrangian parent an ability to calculate lower bounds on the objective and from the particle swarm optimization the ability to effectively parallelise the algorithm. Empirical evaluation using standard test problems from the literature show that the new method outperforms previously published heuristics for this problem and also computes useful lower bounds.","doi":"10.1109/CEC.2010.5585939","publicationTitle":"IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","pdfPath":"/iel5/5573635/5585910/05585939.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CEC.2010.5585939","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5585910","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A hybrid Lagrangian Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm for the degree-constrained minimum spanning tree problem","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5585939","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-23 July 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5585939/","displayDocTitle":"A hybrid Lagrangian Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm for the degree-constrained minimum spanning tree problem","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2010","accessionNumber":"11567743","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5585939/","conferenceDate":"18-23 July 2010","dateOfInsertion":"27 September 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A hybrid Lagrangian Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm for the degree-constrained minimum spanning tree problem","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"C7371.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.116914S","chronDate":"18-23 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5573635","isNumber":"5585910","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5573635","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"5585910","articleId":"5585939","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5585941,"authors":[{"name":"Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Connolly","affiliation":["Laboratoire d'Imagerie, de vision et d'Intelligence Artificielle (LIVIA), \u00c9cole de Technologie sup\u00e9rieure, Universit\u00e9 du Qu\u00e0bec, Montreal, Canada"],"firstName":"Jean-Fran\u00e7ois","lastName":"Connolly","id":"37304488100"},{"name":"Eric Granger","affiliation":["Laboratoire d'Imagerie, de vision et d'Intelligence Artificielle (LIVIA), \u00c9cole de Technologie sup\u00e9rieure, Universit\u00e9 du Qu\u00e0bec, Montreal, Canada"],"firstName":"Eric","lastName":"Granger","id":"37352096000"},{"name":"Robert Sabourin","affiliation":["Laboratoire d'Imagerie, de vision et d'Intelligence Artificielle (LIVIA), \u00c9cole de Technologie sup\u00e9rieure, Universit\u00e9 du Qu\u00e0bec, Montreal, Canada"],"firstName":"Robert","lastName":"Sabourin","id":"37271080400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6911-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6909-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6910-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-778X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0026"}],"articleNumber":"5585941","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":160},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Heuristic algorithms","Optimization","Training","Artificial neural networks","Adaptive systems","Face","Face recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["face recognition","fuzzy neural nets","image classification","learning (artificial intelligence)","particle swarm optimisation","search problems","video signal processing","video streaming"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive ensemble","fuzzy ARTMAP neural networks","video based face classification","population based optimization algorithms","search space","incremental learning strategy","dynamic particle swarm optimization algorithm","long term memory","real world video streams","kNN classifier"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5585941","abstract":"A key feature in population based optimization algorithms is the ability to explore a search space and make a decision based on multiple solutions.

This strategy is applied to an adaptive classification system (ACS) comprised of a swarm of fuzzy ARTMAP (FAM) neural network classifiers, a DPSO algorithm, and a long term memory (LTM). The performance of this ACS with an ensemble of FAM networks selected among local bests of the swarm, is compared to that of the ACS with the global best network under different incremental learning scenarios. Performance is assessed in terms of classification rate and resource requirements for incremental learning of new data blocks extracted from real-world video streams, and are given along with reference kNN and FAM classifier optimized for batch learning. Simulation results indicate that the learning strategy maintains diversity within the ensemble classifiers, providing a significantly higher classification rate than that of the best FAM network alone.

However, a second form of feature extraction does exist and is concerned with optimizing/minimizing the original feature set given by a Type I feature extraction method. This second form of feature extraction has been referred to as Type II feature extraction (also known as feature selection). In this paper, we compare two GEC-based Type II feature extraction methods as applied to periocular-based recognition, an exciting new area of research within the Biometric research community that to date has used Type I feature extraction exclusively.

It is based on the concept of neural network evolution in that particles of a MOPSO swarm (i.e., network solutions) seek to determine user-defined parameters and network (weights and architecture) such that generalisation error and network resources are minimized. The performance of this strategy has been assessed with fuzzy ARTMAP using synthetic and real-world data for video-based face classification. Simulation results indicate that when the MOPSO strategy is used to train fuzzy ARTMAP, it produces a significantly lower classification error than when trained using standard hyper-parameter settings. Furthermore, the non-dominated MOPSO solutions represent a better compromise between error and resource allocation than mono-objective PSO-based strategies that minimizes only classification error. Overall, results obtained with the MOPSO strategy reveal the importance of optimizing parameters and network for each problem, where both error and resources are minimized during fitness evaluation.","doi":"10.1109/CEC.2010.5585953","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","publicationTitle":"IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CEC.2010.5585953","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5585910","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","pdfPath":"/iel5/5573635/5585910/05585953.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Evolving ARTMAP neural networks using Multi-Objective Particle Swarm Optimization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5585953/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Evolving ARTMAP neural networks using Multi-Objective Particle Swarm Optimization","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5585953/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11567757","publicationDate":"July 2010","dateOfInsertion":"27 September 2010","conferenceDate":"18-23 July 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-23 July 2010","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Evolving ARTMAP neural networks using Multi-Objective Particle Swarm Optimization","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"C7886.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.081697S","chronDate":"18-23 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5573635","isNumber":"5585910","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5573635","xplore-issue":"5585910","articleId":"5585953","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":5585954,"authors":[{"name":"Souham Meshoul","affiliation":["The Information Technology Department, CCIS King Saud University Riyadh, Riyadh, Saud Arabia"],"firstName":"Souham","lastName":"Meshoul","id":"37326248800"},{"name":"Mohamed Batouche","affiliation":["The Department of Software Engineering, CCIS, King Saud University, Riyadh, Saud Arabia"],"firstName":"Mohamed","lastName":"Batouche","id":"37282512600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6911-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6909-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6910-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-778X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0026"}],"articleNumber":"5585954","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":166},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Mathematical model","Feature extraction","Equations","Entropy","Particle swarm optimization","Quantum computing","Optimization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["evolutionary computation","image matching","particle swarm optimisation","quantum computing","query formulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["quantum behaved particle swarm optimization","chaotic search","image alignment","search strategy","maximization","entropic measure","mutual information","multimodality images"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5585954","abstract":"In an attempt to improve existing evolutionary metaheuristics quantum computing principles have been used.

One of its critical facets is the optimization method employed. This is often carried out by metaheuristics, such as Genetic Algorithms (GA). The prediction involves optimization of a complex and computationally expensive energy function. Thus, the usual GA requirements of a large number of function evaluations can ultimately result in prohibitive computational costs. We applied a k-nearest neighbors surrogate modeling strategy, with two different similarity criteria, to improve the quality of proteins structures predicted by a crowding-based steady-state GA, without increasing the number of exact fitness evaluations. Additional protein conformations can be investigated using the surrogate model, potentially increasing the exploratory capability of the algorithm. The results obtained from six test proteins suggest that the surrogate model approach has the potential to improve the performance of the described protein structure prediction method.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Full-atom ab initio protein structure prediction with a Genetic Algorithm using a similarity-based surrogate model","publicationTitle":"IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","doi":"10.1109/CEC.2010.5585959","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","pdfPath":"/iel5/5573635/5585910/05585959.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CEC.2010.5585959","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5585910","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5585959","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5585959/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-23 July 2010","displayDocTitle":"Full-atom ab initio protein structure prediction with a Genetic Algorithm using a similarity-based surrogate model","conferenceDate":"18-23 July 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5585959/","dateOfInsertion":"27 September 2010","publicationDate":"July 2010","accessionNumber":"11567759","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Full-atom ab initio protein structure prediction with a Genetic Algorithm using a similarity-based surrogate model","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"C7353.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.089604S","chronDate":"18-23 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5573635","isNumber":"5585910","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5573635","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"5585910","articleId":"5585959","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":5585960,"authors":[{"name":"Shigeyoshi Tsutsui","affiliation":["Department of Management and Information Sciences, Hannan, 5-4-33, Amammihigashi, Matsubara, Osaka 580-8502 Japan"],"firstName":"Shigeyoshi","lastName":"Tsutsui","id":"37280566700"},{"name":"Noriyuki Fujimoto","affiliation":["Osaka Prefecture University, Sakai, Osaka, Japan"],"firstName":"Noriyuki","lastName":"Fujimoto","id":"37299722200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6911-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6909-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6910-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-778X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0026"}],"articleNumber":"5585960","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":123},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5585960","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An analytical study of GPU computation for solving QAPs by parallel evolutionary computation with independent run","abstract":"This paper proposes an evolutionary algorithm for solving QAPs with parallel independent run using GPU computation and gives a statistical analysis on how speedup can be attained with this model.

Path values, estimated by weighting the state values on the selected path, represent the potentiality of finding a better solution if searching on the paths, and are used to memorize the quality of previously visited states. In MORL, visited states are assigned with different immediate rewards by comparing the objective vector of current state with those of the Pareto optimal solutions found previously. These Pareto optimal solutions are stored in an elite list, which keeps track of the non-dominated solutions found so far and is used to construct the Pareto front at the end of the optimisation process. MORL is compared with a promising multi-objective evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition (MOEA/D) on four widely-used benchmark functions. The simulation results have demonstrated that MORL is superior over MOEA/D with respect to the accuracy and the range of the Pareto fronts, especially in solving high-dimensional multi-objective optimisation problems.","doi":"10.1109/CEC.2010.5585972","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","publicationTitle":"IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CEC.2010.5585972","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5585910","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","pdfPath":"/iel5/5573635/5585910/05585972.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-objective optimisation by reinforcement learning","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5585972/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Multi-objective optimisation by reinforcement learning","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5585972/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11567776","publicationDate":"July 2010","dateOfInsertion":"27 September 2010","conferenceDate":"18-23 July 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-23 July 2010","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-objective optimisation by reinforcement learning","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"C7606.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077985S","chronDate":"18-23 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5573635","isNumber":"5585910","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5573635","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5585910","articleId":"5585972","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5585973,"authors":[{"name":"J.

This problem contains a finite set of solutions and belongs to the field of the bi-objective combinatorial optimization. CT is an evolutionary algorithm based on the endosymbiotic evolution and others interactions of the intracellular flow. In the proposed approach, named bi-objective Transgenetic Algorithm (2TA), a pair of transponson agents (one for each objective) and a plasmid agent associated with the cost are applied. The method is validated in 175 uncapacitated instances of the TPPLib benchmark. In these instances the multi-objective version (2TA) is compared to a scalarized version (1TA).

Parameter interaction in non-separable problems is a major source of performance loss specially on large scale problems. Cooperative Co-evolution(CC) has been proposed as a natural solution for large scale optimization problems, but lack of a systematic way of decomposing large scale non-separable problems is a major obstacle for CC frameworks. The aim of this paper is to propose a systematic way of capturing interacting variables for a more effective problem decomposition suitable for cooperative co-evolutionary frameworks. Grouping interacting variables in different subcomponents in a CC framework imposes a limit to the extent interacting variables can be optimized to their optimum values, in other words it limits the improvement interval of interacting variables. This is the central idea of the newly proposed technique which is called delta method. Delta method measures the averaged difference in a certain variable across the entire population and uses it for identifying interacting variables. The experimental results show that this new technique is more effective than the existing random grouping method.","doi":"10.1109/CEC.2010.5585979","publicationTitle":"IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","pdfPath":"/iel5/5573635/5585910/05585979.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CEC.2010.5585979","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5585910","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cooperative Co-evolution with delta grouping for large scale non-separable function optimization","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5585979","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-23 July 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5585979/","displayDocTitle":"Cooperative Co-evolution with delta grouping for large scale non-separable function optimization","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2010","accessionNumber":"11567779","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5585979/","conferenceDate":"18-23 July 2010","dateOfInsertion":"27 September 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cooperative Co-evolution with delta grouping for large scale non-separable function optimization","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"C7597.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060883S","chronDate":"18-23 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5573635","isNumber":"5585910","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5573635","citationCount":"129","xplore-issue":"5585910","articleId":"5585979","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-30"},{"_id":5585982,"authors":[{"name":"Salvatore Greco","affiliation":["Faculty of Economics, University of Catania, Catania, Italy"],"firstName":"Salvatore","lastName":"Greco","id":"37325993500"},{"name":"Benedetto Matarazzo","affiliation":["Faculty of Economics, University of Catania, Catania, Italy"],"firstName":"Benedetto","lastName":"Matarazzo","id":"37332194900"},{"name":"Roman Slowi\u0144ski","affiliation":["Systems Research Institute, Polish Academy of Sciences, Warsaw, Poland","Institute of Computing Science, Pozna\u0144 University of Technology, Pozna\u0144"],"firstName":"Roman","lastName":"Slowi\u0144ski","id":"37332196700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6911-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6909-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6910-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-778X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0026"}],"articleNumber":"5585982","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":16,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":234},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5585982","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Approximation methods","Delta modulation","Optimization","Sorting","Robustness","Hip","Electronic mail"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decision making","evolutionary computation","optimisation","rough set theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["interactive evolutionary multiobjective optimization","dominance-based rough set approach","successive iteration","decision rules","decision maker","Pareto front"]}],"doi":"10.1109/CEC.2010.5585982","pdfPath":"/iel5/5573635/5585910/05585982.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5585910","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CEC.2010.5585982","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Interactive Evolutionary Multiobjective Optimization using Dominance-based Rough Set Approach","abstract":"We present basic ideas related to application of Dominance-based Rough Set Approach (DRSA) in interactive Evolutionary Multiobjective Optimization (EMO).

QEA use a probabilistic representation, called Q-bit, to encode individuals in population. Unlike standard evolutionary algorithms, each Q-bit individual is a probability model, which can represent multiple solutions. Since probability models store global statistical information of good solutions found previously in the search, QEA have good potential to deal with hard optimization problems with many local optimal solutions. So far, not much work has been done on evolutionary multi-objective (EMO) algorithms with probabilistic representation. In this paper, we investigate the performance of two state-of-the-art EMO algorithms - MOEA/D and NSGA-II, with probabilistic representation based on pheromone trails, on the multi-objective travelling salesman problem.

System-level fault diagnosis is concerned with the identification of all faulty components among a set of hundreds (or even thousands) of interconnected units, usually by thoroughly examining a collection of test outcomes carried out by the nodes under a specific test model. This task has non-polynomial complexity and can be posed as a combinatorial optimization problem. Here, we apply a binary version of the Particle Swarm Optimization meta-heuristic approach to solve the system-level fault diagnosis problem (BPSO-FD) under the invalidation and comparison diagnosis models. Our method is computationally simpler than those already published in literature and, according to our empirical results, BPSO-FD quickly and reliably identifies the true ensemble of faulty units and scales well for large parallel and distributed systems.","doi":"10.1109/CEC.2010.5586002","pdfPath":"/iel5/5573635/5585910/05586002.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","publicationTitle":"IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CEC.2010.5586002","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5585910","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A binary Particle Swarm Optimization approach to fault diagnosis in parallel and distributed systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5586002/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-23 July 2010","displayDocTitle":"A binary Particle Swarm Optimization approach to fault diagnosis in parallel and distributed systems","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"27 September 2010","accessionNumber":"11567806","publicationDate":"July 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5586002/","conferenceDate":"18-23 July 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A binary Particle Swarm Optimization approach to fault diagnosis in parallel and distributed systems","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"C7520.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.095233S","chronDate":"18-23 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5573635","isNumber":"5585910","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5573635","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"5585910","articleId":"5586002","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":5586010,"authors":[{"name":"Shen Wang","affiliation":["Department of Automatic Control and Systems Engineering, University of Sheffield, Sheffield, UK"],"firstName":"Shen","lastName":"Wang","id":"38195579500"},{"name":"Mahdi Mahfouf","affiliation":["Department of Automatic Control and Systems Engineering, University of Sheffield, Sheffield, UK"],"firstName":"Mahdi","lastName":"Mahfouf","id":"37267999100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6911-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6909-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6910-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-778X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0026"}],"articleNumber":"5586010","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":146},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optimization","Training data","Approximation methods","Approximation algorithms","Biological system modeling","Training","Predictive models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["alloy steel","convergence","design engineering","mathematics computing","multilayer perceptrons","Pareto optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiobjective optimization","optimal design","alloy-steels","fitness model-estimate","approximate model","global reseeding strategy","Pareto solutions","NSGA-II","multilayer perceptron neural network","fitness landscape model","engineering problem","chemical composition"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5586010","abstract":"This paper reports on an efficient algorithm for locating the `optimal' solutions for multi-objective optimization problems by combining a state-of-the-art optimizer with a fitness model-estimate. This hybrid framework is introduced to illustrate how to make sufficient use of an approximate model, which includes a `controlled' process and an `uncontrolled' process during the search. With the inclusion of such approximate model in the optimization block, a global reseeding strategy based on previous data is also applied to improve the ability of the multi-objective optimizer to find global set of solutions (`pareto' solutions). To this effect, the popular algorithm, NSGA-II, and a Multi-Layer Perceptron Neural Network (MLP) are combined synergetically to show details of such processing. Furthermore, a simple (but no simpler) method for selecting the `training' data necessary for eliciting the fitness landscape model is suggested to address what are now a common engineering problems, in particular those associated with sparse data distributions and objectives converging at significantly different speeds. To test the validity of the proposed multi-objective scheme, a series of simulation experiments, using well-know benchmark functions, are conducted and are compared to those carried-out while using the original NSGA-II and SPEA-2, under similar conditions. The proposed method is also applied to the `optimal' design of alloy steels in terms of chemical compositions and processing conditions and is shown to perform very well.","doi":"10.1109/CEC.2010.5586010","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","publicationTitle":"IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CEC.2010.5586010","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5585910","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","pdfPath":"/iel5/5573635/5585910/05586010.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient multi-objective optimization with fitness landscape \u2014 A special application to the optimal design of alloy-steels","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5586010/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Efficient multi-objective optimization with fitness landscape \u2014 A special application to the optimal design of alloy-steels","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5586010/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11567814","publicationDate":"July 2010","dateOfInsertion":"27 September 2010","conferenceDate":"18-23 July 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-23 July 2010","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient multi-objective optimization with fitness landscape \u2014 A special application to the optimal design of alloy-steels","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"C7343.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.0939S","chronDate":"18-23 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5573635","isNumber":"5585910","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5573635","xplore-issue":"5585910","articleId":"5586010","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5586011,"authors":[{"name":"Laurence Rodrigues do Amaral","affiliation":["Department of Computer Sciences, Federal University of Goias/Jatai, Jatai, GO, Brazil"],"firstName":"Laurence Rodrigues","lastName":"do Amaral","id":"38246511500"},{"name":"Estevam Rafael Hruschka","affiliation":["Department of Computer Sciences, Federal University of Sao Carlos, Sao Carlos, SP, Brazil"],"firstName":"Estevam Rafael","lastName":"Hruschka","id":"37681153100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6911-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6909-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6910-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-778X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0026"}],"articleNumber":"5586011","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":89},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Ontologies","Databases","Biological processes","Accuracy","Vocabulary","Proteins"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biology computing","database management systems","evolutionary computation","ontologies (artificial intelligence)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["gene ontology classification","genetic algorithms","biology application domains","computational evolutionary environment","biological database","prediction precision","prediction interpretability","prediction comprehensibility","decision trees","One R","single conjunctive rule learner"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5586011","abstract":"Computational approaches have been applied in many different biology application domains.

This paper reports a novel ripple-spreading GA (RSGA) for the NCP. In contrast to existing GAs where a chromosome directly represents a solution, the proposed RSGA separates chromosomes and solutions by introducing a purpose-designed pre-problem for the NCP. In the pre-problem, the nodes in the NCP are projected into an artificial space, in which some ripple epicenters are randomly generated. Then a specially parameterized ripple-spreading process is employed such that as ripples (starting from the epicenters) spread out in the artificial space, the incoming signals and outgoing signals of all nodes will be individually determined, according to the amplitudes of the ripples which have reached the node. Changing the values of the ripple-spreading parameters will result in different information flows in the networks. Therefore, a simple binary-string based GA, unlike existing GAs which employ permutation representations for the NCP, can be used to optimize the values of the ripple-spreading parameters, in order to find a good solution to the NCP. A potential advantage of the RSGA is its scalability in complex networks, where permutation representation based GAs may face serious memory-efficiency problems. The effectiveness of the proposed RSGA is illustrated in the context of some experiments.","doi":"10.1109/CEC.2010.5586023","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","publicationTitle":"IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CEC.2010.5586023","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5585910","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","pdfPath":"/iel5/5573635/5585910/05586023.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A ripple-spreading genetic algorithm for the network coding problem","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5586023/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A ripple-spreading genetic algorithm for the network coding problem","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5586023/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11567870","publicationDate":"July 2010","dateOfInsertion":"27 September 2010","conferenceDate":"18-23 July 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-23 July 2010","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A ripple-spreading genetic algorithm for the network coding problem","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"C7337.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.10218S","chronDate":"18-23 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5573635","isNumber":"5585910","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5573635","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"5585910","articleId":"5586023","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5586026,"authors":[{"name":"S.

This shows that the notion of robust parameters is questionable and the issue requires further research. Finally, the results raise the question what the outcome of the CEC-2005 competition would have been, if all of EAs had been tuned by REVAC, but without further research it remains an open question whether we crowned the wrong king.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Evolutionary computation","Tuners","Strontium","Measurement","Optimization","Testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["evolutionary computation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["world champion evolutionary algorithm","REVAC parameter tuning method"]}],"doi":"10.1109/CEC.2010.5586026","publicationTitle":"IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","pdfPath":"/iel5/5573635/5585910/05586026.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5585910","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CEC.2010.5586026","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Beating the \u2018world champion\u2019 evolutionary algorithm via REVAC tuning","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5586026","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Beating the \u2018world champion\u2019 evolutionary algorithm via REVAC tuning","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5586026/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5586026/","accessionNumber":"11567869","conferenceDate":"18-23 July 2010","dateOfInsertion":"27 September 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-23 July 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Beating the \u2018world champion\u2019 evolutionary algorithm via REVAC tuning","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"C7336.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060196S","chronDate":"18-23 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5573635","isNumber":"5585910","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5573635","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"5585910","articleId":"5586026","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5586030,"authors":[{"name":"Shane Boulden","affiliation":["Defence Security Applications Research Center, University of New South Wales, Canberra, ACT, Australia"],"firstName":"Shane","lastName":"Boulden","id":"38193105300"},{"name":"Antony William Iorio","affiliation":["Defence Security Applications Research Center, University of New South Wales, Canberra, ACT, Australia"],"firstName":"Antony William","lastName":"Iorio","id":"38196214600"},{"name":"Hussein Aly Abbass","affiliation":["Defence Security Applications Research Center, University of New South Wales, Canberra, ACT, Australia"],"firstName":"Hussein Aly","lastName":"Abbass","id":"37276311400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6911-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6909-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6910-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-778X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0026"}],"articleNumber":"5586030","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":112},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Games","Synchronization","Biological cells","Complex networks","Social network services","Frequency synchronization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["game theory","genetic algorithms","iterative methods","large-scale systems","topology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["networked complex system","genetic algorithm","synchronization behavior learning","spatial iterated prisoner's dilemma game","complex network topology"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5586030","abstract":"Being able to learn the synchronization behavior of a networked complex system has profound implications for studying and modeling many natural and artificial phenomena, such as the spread of diseases, emergence of social trends, as well as more effective agent based distillation models.

This work proposes an approach to the problem in which neural network weight values are optimized using a particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. Such an approach has not previously been demonstrated as feasible for Tetris. The reported experimental results show the learning progress of the algorithm, as well as a comparison against a hand-optimized Tetris playing algorithm. The results indicate that the Tetris agents show a continuous improvement over the course of training. Since the experimental focus was on the feasibility of the approach rather than optimizing performance, optimized PSO-based agents were found to be outperformed by the hand-optimized algorithm. However, the playing strategies of the two agents were compared and shown to be similar. The results indicate that a swarm-based approach is feasible, and warrants further investigation.","doi":"10.1109/CEC.2010.5586033","pdfPath":"/iel5/5573635/5585910/05586033.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","publicationTitle":"IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CEC.2010.5586033","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5585910","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Swarm Tetris: Applying particle swarm optimization to tetris","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5586033/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-23 July 2010","displayDocTitle":"Swarm Tetris: Applying particle swarm optimization to tetris","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"27 September 2010","accessionNumber":"11567880","publicationDate":"July 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5586033/","conferenceDate":"18-23 July 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Swarm Tetris: Applying particle swarm optimization to tetris","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"C7329.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064275S","chronDate":"18-23 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5573635","isNumber":"5585910","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5573635","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"5585910","articleId":"5586033","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5586034,"authors":[{"name":"Daniel Molina","affiliation":["Department of Computer Languages and Systems, University of Cadiz, Cadiz, Spain"],"firstName":"Daniel","lastName":"Molina","id":"37560872100"},{"name":"Manuel Lozano","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence, University of Granada, Granada, Spain"],"firstName":"Manuel","lastName":"Lozano","id":"37436736400"},{"name":"Francisco Herrera","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence, University of Granada, Granada, Spain"],"firstName":"Francisco","lastName":"Herrera","id":"37270827700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6911-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6909-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6910-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-778X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0026"}],"articleNumber":"5586034","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":88,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":934},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Steady-state","Optimization","Convergence","Proposals","Memetics","Biological cells","Evolutionary computation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimisation","search problems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MA-SW-Chains","memetic algorithm","local search chains","large scale continuous global optimization","complex continuous optimization problems"]}],"abstract":"Memetic algorithms are effective algorithms to obtain reliable and accurate solutions for complex continuous optimization problems. Nowadays, high dimensional optimization problems are an interesting field of research. The high dimensionality introduces new problems for the optimization process, requiring more scalable algorithms that, at the same time, could explore better the higher domain space around each solution. In this work, we proposed a memetic algorithm, MA-SW-Chains, for large scale global optimization. This algorithm assigns to each individual a local search intensity that depends on its features, by chaining different local search applications. MA-SW-Chains is an adaptation to large scale optimization of a previous algorithm, MA-CMA-Chains, to improve its performance on high-dimensional problems.

In this work, we applied evolutionary computation to develop a driver for the 2009 edition of this competition. In particular, we focused on the optimization of the car setup of an existing driver (the winner of the 2008 edition) and applied cooperative coevolution to evolve the best car setup for the qualifying rounds of each leg of the championship. After 10 legs involving 12 teams, our driver was able to reach the 4th position in the final standings. We believe that this is a very promising result especially if we consider that we only focused on the car setup and the other teams participated also to most of the previous four editions (gaining much domain knowledge). Overall, our results show that cooperative coevolution can be very effective in this complex optimization task producing setups that can be competitive with respect to the ones tuned by human experts. Therefore, our results also suggest that simple evolutionary computation might represent a helpful tool to human designers for improving the performance of already heavily tuned drivers.","doi":"10.1109/CEC.2010.5586041","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CEC.2010.5586041","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","pdfPath":"/iel5/5573635/5585910/05586041.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5585910","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Applying cooperative coevolution to compete in the 2009 TORCS Endurance World Championship","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"18-23 July 2010","displayDocTitle":"Applying cooperative coevolution to compete in the 2009 TORCS Endurance World Championship","conferenceDate":"18-23 July 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2010","dateOfInsertion":"27 September 2010","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5586041/","accessionNumber":"11567884","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5586041/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Applying cooperative coevolution to compete in the 2009 TORCS Endurance World Championship","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"C7325.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072173S","chronDate":"18-23 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5573635","isNumber":"5585910","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5573635","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"5585910","articleId":"5586041","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5586045,"authors":[{"name":"K.

As a result, the performance of cNrGA depends on the order of the evaluated solutions. In this paper, we propose to remove this dependence by a search space re-partitioning strategy. At each iteration, the strategy re-shuffles the solutions into random order. The re-ordered sequence is then used to construct a new density tree, which leads to a new space partition sets. Afterwards, instead of randomly picking a mutant within a partition, a new adaptive one-gene-flip mutation is applied. Motivated from the fact that the proposed adaptive mutation concerns only small amount of partitions, we propose a new density tree construction algorithm. This algorithm refuses to partition the sub-regions which do not contain any individual to be mutated, which simplifies the tree topology as well as speeds up the construction time. The new cNrGA integrated with the proposed re-partitioning strategy (cNrGA/RP/OGF) is examined on 19 benchmark functions at dimensions ranging from 2 to 40. The simulation results show that cNrGA/RP/OGF is significantly superior to the original cNrGA at most of the test functions. Its average performance is also better than those of six benchmark EAs.","doi":"10.1109/CEC.2010.5586046","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","publicationTitle":"IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CEC.2010.5586046","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5585910","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","pdfPath":"/iel5/5573635/5585910/05586046.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Continuous non-revisiting genetic algorithm with random search space re-partitioning and one-gene-flip mutation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5586046/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Continuous non-revisiting genetic algorithm with random search space re-partitioning and one-gene-flip mutation","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5586046/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11567892","publicationDate":"July 2010","dateOfInsertion":"27 September 2010","conferenceDate":"18-23 July 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-23 July 2010","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Continuous non-revisiting genetic algorithm with random search space re-partitioning and one-gene-flip mutation","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"C7322.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073566S","chronDate":"18-23 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5573635","isNumber":"5585910","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5573635","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"5585910","articleId":"5586046","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5586051,"authors":[{"name":"Ignacio G. del Amo","affiliation":["Dept. of Computer Sciences and Artificial Intelligence, University of Granada, Spain"],"firstName":"Ignacio G.","lastName":"del Amo","id":"38193143600"},{"name":"David A.

For this purpose we define three fitness functions which are based on the number of enemies killed, the lifespan of the bot and a combination of both. Long run experiments were carried out, in which the evolved bots' behaviours outperform those of standard bots supplied by the game, particularly in those cases where the fitness involves a measure of the bot's lifespan. Also, there is an increase in the number of items collected, and the behaviours tend to become less aggressive, tending instead towards a more optimised combat style. Further \u201cshort run\u201d experiments were carried out with a further type of fitness function defined, based on the number of items picked. In these cases the bots evolve performances towards the goal they have been aimed, with no other behaviours arising, except in the case of the multiple objective one. We conclude that in order to evolve interesting behaviours more complex fitness functions are needed, and not necessarily ones that directly include the goal we are aiming for.","doi":"10.1109/CEC.2010.5586059","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","pdfPath":"/iel5/5573635/5585910/05586059.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CEC.2010.5586059","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5585910","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Controlling bots in a First Person Shooter game using genetic algorithms","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Games","Biological cells","Humans","Weapons","Steady-state","Artificial neural networks","Artificial intelligence"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer games","genetic algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["First Person Shooter game","genetic algorithm","computer game","fitness function","bots behaviour"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5586059/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-23 July 2010","displayDocTitle":"Controlling bots in a First Person Shooter game using genetic algorithms","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5586059/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2010","dateOfInsertion":"27 September 2010","conferenceDate":"18-23 July 2010","accessionNumber":"11567905","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Controlling bots in a First Person Shooter game using genetic algorithms","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"C7813.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.09925S","chronDate":"18-23 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5573635","isNumber":"5585910","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5573635","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"5585910","articleId":"5586059","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5586061,"authors":[{"name":"Masafumi Kuroda","affiliation":["University of Miyazaki, Miyazaki, Japan"],"firstName":"Masafumi","lastName":"Kuroda","id":"38194778200"},{"name":"Kunihito Yamamori","affiliation":["University of Miyazaki, Miyazaki, Japan"],"firstName":"Kunihito","lastName":"Yamamori","id":"37323999500"},{"name":"Masaharu Munetomo","affiliation":["Information Initiative Center, Hokkaido University, Japan"],"firstName":"Masaharu","lastName":"Munetomo","id":"37330250200"},{"name":"Moritoshi Yasunaga","affiliation":["Graduate School of Systems and Information Engineering, University of Tsukuba, Japan"],"firstName":"Moritoshi","lastName":"Yasunaga","id":"37281962000"},{"name":"Ikuo Yoshihara","affiliation":["University of Miyazaki, Miyazaki, Japan"],"firstName":"Ikuo","lastName":"Yoshihara","id":"37323751000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6911-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6909-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6910-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-778X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0026"}],"articleNumber":"5586061","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":230},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cities and towns","Benchmark testing","Equations","Biological cells","Joining processes","Traveling salesman problems","Fitting"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","search problems","travelling salesman problems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["zoning crossover","hybrid genetic algorithms","large scale traveling salesman problems","crossover operator","Lin Kernighan heuristic","local search","maximal preservative crossover","greedy sub-tour crossover","edge recombination crossover"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5586061","abstract":"This paper proposes a novel crossover operator for solving large-scale traveling salesman problems (TSPs) by using a Hybrid Genetic Algorithm (HGA) with Lin-Kernighan heuristic for local search and we tentatively name Zoning Crossover (Z-Cross). The outline of Z-Cross is firstly to set a zone in the travelling area according to some rules, secondly to cut edges connecting cities between inside and outside the zone, thirdly to exchange edges inside the zone of one parent and those of the other parent, and lastly to reconnect sub-tours and isolated cities, which come about in the 3rd step mentioned above, so as to construct a new tour of TSP. The method is compared with conventional three crossovers; those are the Maximal Preservative Crossover, the Greedy Sub-tour Crossover and the Edge Recombination Crossover, and evaluated from the viewpoints of tour quality and CPU time. Ten benchmarks are selected from the well-known TSP website of Georgia Institute of Technology, whose names are xqf131, xqg237, ..., sra104815. The experiments are performed ten times for each crossover and each benchmark and show that the Z-Cross succeeds in finding better solution and running faster than the conventional methods. Six benchmarks with size from 39,603 to 104,815 cities are selected from the TSP website and challenged the records of tour lengths. The Z-Cross betters the record of the problem rbz43748 and approaches to solutions less than only 0.02% over the known best solutions for five instances.","doi":"10.1109/CEC.2010.5586061","pdfPath":"/iel5/5573635/5585910/05586061.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","publicationTitle":"IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CEC.2010.5586061","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5585910","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A proposal for Zoning Crossover of Hybrid Genetic Algorithms for large-scale traveling salesman problems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5586061/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-23 July 2010","displayDocTitle":"A proposal for Zoning Crossover of Hybrid Genetic Algorithms for large-scale traveling salesman problems","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"27 September 2010","accessionNumber":"11567904","publicationDate":"July 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5586061/","conferenceDate":"18-23 July 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A proposal for Zoning Crossover of Hybrid Genetic Algorithms for large-scale traveling salesman problems","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"C7913.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.097311S","chronDate":"18-23 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5573635","isNumber":"5585910","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5573635","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5585910","articleId":"5586061","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5586075,"authors":[{"name":"Martin Pil\u00e2t","affiliation":["Department of Theoretical Computer Science and Mathematical Logic, Faculty of Mathematics and Physics, Charles University, Prague, Czech Republic"],"firstName":"Martin","lastName":"Pil\u00e2t","id":"37691550300"},{"name":"Roman Neruda","affiliation":["Institute of Computer Science, Academy of Sciences\uc2a0of the\uc2a0Czech Republic, Prague, Czech Republic"],"firstName":"Roman","lastName":"Neruda","id":"37273011800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6911-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6909-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6910-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-778X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0026"}],"articleNumber":"5586075","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":170},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5586075","abstract":"The majority of multiobjective genetic algorithms is computationally expensive, therefore they often need to be parallelized before they can be used to solve practical tasks.

Previous researches have shown that DSMGA can effectively solve nearly decomposable problems. The efficiency of DSMGA and other model-building GAs greatly depend on their interaction-detection metrics. This paper investigates three commonly used metrics, nonlinearity, simultaneity, and entropy. Then it proposes a new interaction-detection metric which aims at what GAs really need. The proposed metric, namely the differential mutual complement, is based on both the disruption and reproduction effects of the crossover operator on significant schemata. Empirical results show that DSMGA with the proposed metric performs better than the other existing metrics on the aspects of sensitivity to threshold and function evaluation. This new metric is shown to perform well on DSMGA and could be expected to work with other EDAs.","doi":"10.1109/CEC.2010.5586098","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","publicationTitle":"IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CEC.2010.5586098","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5585910","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","pdfPath":"/iel5/5573635/5585910/05586098.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Interaction-detection metric with differential mutual complement for dependency structure matrix genetic algorithm","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5586098/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Interaction-detection metric with differential mutual complement for dependency structure matrix genetic algorithm","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5586098/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11567969","publicationDate":"July 2010","dateOfInsertion":"27 September 2010","conferenceDate":"18-23 July 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-23 July 2010","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Interaction-detection metric with differential mutual complement for dependency structure matrix genetic algorithm","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"C7502.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.132246S","chronDate":"18-23 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5573635","isNumber":"5585910","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5573635","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5585910","articleId":"5586098","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":5586124,"authors":[{"name":"Hemant Kumar Singh","affiliation":["School of Engineering and Information Technology, University of New South Wales, Canberra, ACT, Australia"],"firstName":"Hemant Kumar","lastName":"Singh","id":"37697638400"},{"name":"Tapabrata Ray","affiliation":["School of Engineering and Information Technology, University of New South Wales, Canberra, ACT, Australia"],"firstName":"Tapabrata","lastName":"Ray","id":"37276115400"},{"name":"Warren Smith","affiliation":["School of Engineering and Information Technology, University of New South Wales, Canberra, ACT, Australia"],"firstName":"Warren","lastName":"Smith","id":"37689374500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6911-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6909-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6910-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-778X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0026"}],"articleNumber":"5586124","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":15,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":428},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Simulated annealing","Data models","Approximation algorithms","Probability","Annealing","Predictive models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["evolutionary computation","simulated annealing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["surrogate assisted simulated annealing","constrained multiobjective optimization","evolutionary algorithm","point to point search method","engineering design problem","heuristic"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5586124","abstract":"Real life optimization problems often involve a tradeoff between multiple objectives. They also comprise constraints, which may be due to various factors such as the strength of materials, stability and safety of design, limits on operational time, financial viability and many others. In recent years, Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) have been a popular choice for solving such multi-objective, constrained problems for various reasons. Point to point search methods, such as Simulated Annealing (SA) have been largely unexplored for such problems. However, some recent studies have suggested that with certain enhancements, SA can also be an effective tool to deal with such problems. The ability of SA to accept uphill moves (unlike EAs) during the search makes it a less prone to getting trapped in a local minimum, and is therefore attractive for solving optimization problems. For many engineering design problems, evaluating a candidate solution can be computationally intensive. This can often put a restriction on the number of function evaluations to find a near optimum solution. To mitigate this problem, often suitable approximations (surrogates) are used in optimization instead of real function evaluations. Surrogate assisted approaches have so far been used in the paradigm of Evolutionary Algorithms (EA). In this paper, we extend the use of surrogates to another well known heuristic, Simulated Annealing (SA), for constrained, multi-objective problems. A comparison with currently prevalent EAs on a difficult set of constrained problems has been included in order to highlight the efficacy of the proposed approach.","doi":"10.1109/CEC.2010.5586124","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","publicationTitle":"IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CEC.2010.5586124","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5585910","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","pdfPath":"/iel5/5573635/5585910/05586124.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Surrogate assisted Simulated Annealing (SASA) for constrained multi-objective optimization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5586124/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Surrogate assisted Simulated Annealing (SASA) for constrained multi-objective optimization","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5586124/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11567996","publicationDate":"July 2010","dateOfInsertion":"27 September 2010","conferenceDate":"18-23 July 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-23 July 2010","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Surrogate assisted Simulated Annealing (SASA) for constrained multi-objective optimization","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"C7437.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.118163S","chronDate":"18-23 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5573635","isNumber":"5585910","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5573635","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"5585910","articleId":"5586124","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5586126,"authors":[{"name":"Jie Yang","affiliation":["School of Electrical, Computer and Telecommunications Engineering, ICT Research Institute, University of Wollongong, Australia"],"firstName":"Jie","lastName":"Yang","id":"37716102400"},{"name":"Abdesselam Bouzerdoum","affiliation":["School of Electrical, Computer and Telecommunications Engineering, ICT Research Institute, University of Wollongong, Australia"],"firstName":"Abdesselam","lastName":"Bouzerdoum","id":"37275455900"},{"name":"Son Lam Phung","affiliation":["School of Electrical, Computer and Telecommunications Engineering, ICT Research Institute, University of Wollongong, Australia"],"firstName":"Son Lam","lastName":"Phung","id":"37275456900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6911-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6909-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6910-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-778X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0026"}],"articleNumber":"5586126","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":189},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Algorithm design and analysis","Optimization","Arrays","Convergence","Particle swarm optimization","Accuracy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["algorithm theory","evolutionary computation","particle swarm optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["particle swarm optimization algorithm","orthogonal design","evolutionary algorithm","genetic algorithm","evolutionary strategy","multivariate optimization","generating-and-updating model","elitism preservation strategy"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5586126","abstract":"The last decade has witnessed a great interest in using evolutionary algorithms, such as genetic algorithms, evolutionary strategies and particle swarm optimization (PSO), for multivariate optimization.

In our approach, this limitation of the standard PSO is overcome by using a novel crossover operator based on orthogonal design. Furthermore, instead of the \u201cgenerating-and-updating\u201d model in the standard PSO, the elitism preservation strategy is applied to determine the possible movements of the candidate particles in the subsequent iterations. Experimental results demonstrate that our algorithm has a better performance compared to existing methods, including five PSO algorithms and three evolutionary algorithms.","doi":"10.1109/CEC.2010.5586126","pdfPath":"/iel5/5573635/5585910/05586126.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","publicationTitle":"IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CEC.2010.5586126","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5585910","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A particle swarm optimization algorithm based on orthogonal design","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5586126/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-23 July 2010","displayDocTitle":"A particle swarm optimization algorithm based on orthogonal design","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"27 September 2010","accessionNumber":"11567998","publicationDate":"July 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5586126/","conferenceDate":"18-23 July 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A particle swarm optimization algorithm based on orthogonal design","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"C7827.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.082744S","chronDate":"18-23 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5573635","isNumber":"5585910","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5573635","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5585910","articleId":"5586126","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":5586127,"authors":[{"name":"Mohammad Nabi Omidvar","affiliation":["Evolutionary Computing and Machine Learning Group (ECML), the School of Computer Science and IT, RMIT University, Melbourne, VIC, Australia"],"firstName":"Mohammad Nabi","lastName":"Omidvar","id":"37683412100"},{"name":"Xiaodong Li","affiliation":["Evolutionary Computing and Machine Learning Group (ECML), the School of Computer Science and IT, RMIT University, Melbourne, VIC, Australia"],"firstName":"Xiaodong","lastName":"Li","id":"37071736800"},{"name":"Zhenyu Yang","affiliation":["Nature Inspired Computation and Application Laboratory, Department of Computer Science and Technology, University of Science and Technology, Hefei, Anhui, China"],"firstName":"Zhenyu","lastName":"Yang","id":"37696277700"},{"name":"Xin Yao","affiliation":["Centre of Excellence of Research in Computational Intelligence and Applications (CERCIA), School of Computer Science, University of Binningham, Birmingham, UK"],"firstName":"Xin","lastName":"Yao","id":"37276074900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6911-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6909-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6910-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-778X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0026"}],"articleNumber":"5586127","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":111,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":844},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optimization","Probability","Computer science","Electronic mail","Space exploration","Computational modeling","Software"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["random grouping","multilevel cooperative coevolution","large scale continuous global function optimization","adaptive weighting","fitness evaluations"]}],"doi":"10.1109/CEC.2010.5586127","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5586127","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CEC.2010.5586127","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5585910","publicationTitle":"IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","pdfPath":"/iel5/5573635/5585910/05586127.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cooperative Co-evolution for large scale optimization through more frequent random grouping","abstract":"In this paper we propose three techniques to improve the performance of one of the major algorithms for large scale continuous global function optimization. Multilevel Cooperative Co-evolution (MLCC) is based on a Cooperative Co-evolutionary framework and employs a technique called random grouping in order to group interacting variables in one subcomponent. It also uses another technique called adaptive weighting for co-adaptation of subcomponents. We prove that the probability of grouping interacting variables in one subcomponent using random grouping drops significantly as the number of interacting variables increases. This calls for more frequent random grouping of variables. We show how to increase the frequency of random grouping without increasing the number of fitness evaluations. We also show that adaptive weighting is ineffective and in most cases fails to improve the quality of found solution, and hence wastes considerable amount of CPU time by extra evaluations of objective function. Finally we propose a new technique for self-adaptation of the subcomponent sizes in CC. We demonstrate how a substantial improvement can be gained by applying these three techniques.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5586127/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-23 July 2010","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"18-23 July 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"27 September 2010","publicationDate":"July 2010","accessionNumber":"11567995","htmlLink":"/document/5586127/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Cooperative Co-evolution for large scale optimization through more frequent random grouping","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cooperative Co-evolution for large scale optimization through more frequent random grouping","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"C7543.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.105497S","chronDate":"18-23 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5573635","isNumber":"5585910","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5573635","citationCount":"111","xplore-issue":"5585910","articleId":"5586127","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":5586129,"authors":[{"name":"Giovanni Cantor","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, Artificial Life Research Group, National University of Colombia, Colombia"],"firstName":"Giovanni","lastName":"Cantor","id":"38075559700"},{"name":"Jonatan G\u00f3mez","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, Artificial Life Research Group, National University of Colombia, Colombia"],"firstName":"Jonatan","lastName":"G\u00f3mez","id":"37276297900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6911-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6909-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6910-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-778X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0026"}],"articleNumber":"5586129","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":116},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Automata","Explosions","Evolutionary computation","Genetics","Mathematical model","Traveling salesman problems","Optimization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular automata","genetic algorithms","parallel algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fine grained parallel genetic algorithm","Cambrian explosion","evolutionary algorithm","cellular automaton state","genetic operators","massive extinction operation","genetic diversity analysis"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5586129","abstract":"This paper describes an evolutionary algorithm (EA) which combines cellular automata, Cambrian explosions and massive extinctions ideas in order to maintain diversity and automatically determine the population's size of the EA. Individuals are organized in a two-dimensional grid (2-dimensional cellular automaton surface) and are considered active or inactive according to the cellular automaton state. The individual state is updated according to the cellular automaton state rules at each step (iteration) of the evolutionary process. Only active individuals are subject to evolution by applying one of the genetic operators and considering just their active neighbors (when multiple parents are required). Depending on the total number of active individuals, a Cambrian explosion or a massive extinction operation is applied, in a random fashion to control the size of the population.

Online social networking sites like Twitter, Facebook and Orkut are among the most visited sites in the Internet. Presently, there is a great interest in trying to understand the complexities of this type of network from both theoretical and applied point of view. The understanding of these social network graphs is important to improve the current social network systems, and also to develop new applications. Here, we propose a friend recommendation system for social network based on the topology of the network graphs. The topology of network that connects a user to his friends is examined and a local social network called Oro-Aro is used in the experiments. We developed an algorithm that analyses the sub-graph composed by a user and all the others connected people separately by three degree of separation. However, only users separated by two degree of separation are candidates to be suggested as a friend. The algorithm uses the patterns defined by their connections to find those users who have similar behavior as the root user. The recommendation mechanism was developed based on the characterization and analyses of the network formed by the user's friends and friends-of-friends (FOF).","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-23 July 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5586144/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11579741","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5586144/","publicationDate":"July 2010","dateOfInsertion":"27 September 2010","conferenceDate":"18-23 July 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A graph-based friend recommendation system using Genetic Algorithm","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A graph-based friend recommendation system using Genetic Algorithm","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"C7847.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05551S","chronDate":"18-23 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5573635","isNumber":"5585910","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5573635","citationCount":"63","xplore-issue":"5585910","articleId":"5586144","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":5586149,"authors":[{"name":"Trent Higgs","affiliation":["Institute of Integrated and Intelligent Systems (IIIS), Griffith University, QLD, Australia"],"firstName":"Trent","lastName":"Higgs","id":"38196110600"},{"name":"Bela Stantic","affiliation":["Institute of Integrated and Intelligent Systems (IIIS), Griffith University, QLD, Australia"],"firstName":"Bela","lastName":"Stantic","id":"37402591000"},{"name":"Md Tamjidul Hoque","affiliation":["Discovery Biology, Eskitis Institute of Cell & Molecular Therapies, Griffith University, QLD, Australia"],"firstName":"Md Tamjidul","lastName":"Hoque","id":"37296228600"},{"name":"Abdul Sattar","affiliation":["Institute of Integrated and Intelligent Systems (IIIS), Griffith University, QLD, Australia"],"firstName":"Abdul","lastName":"Sattar","id":"37276061400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6911-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6909-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6910-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-778X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0026"}],"articleNumber":"5586149","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":116},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Proteins","Biological cells","Software","Lattices","Genetics","Amino acids"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biology computing","genetic algorithms","Monte Carlo methods","proteins","sampling methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithm","feature-based resampling technique","protein structure prediction","nuclear magnetic resonance","x-ray crystallography","Monte Carlo based algorithms"]}],"abstract":"Proteins carry out the majority of functionality on a cellular level. Computational protein structure prediction (PSP) methods have been introduced to speed up the PSP process due to manual methods, like nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and x-ray crystallography (XC) taking numerous months even years to produce a predicted structure for a target protein. A lot of work in this area is focused on the type of search strategy to employ. Two popular methods in the literature are: Monte Carlo based algorithms and Genetic Algorithms. Genetic Algorithms (GA) have proven to be quite useful in the PSP field, as they allow for a generic search approach, which alleviates the need to redefine the search strategies for separate sequences. They also lend themselves well to feature-based resampling techniques. Feature-based resampling works by taking previously computed local minima and combining features from them to create new structures that are more uniformly low in free energy. In this work we present a feature-based resampling genetic algorithm to refine structures that are outputted by PSP software. Our results indicate that our approach performs well, and produced an average 9.5% root mean square deviation (RMSD) improvement and a 17.36% template modeling score (TM-Score) improvement.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Genetic algorithm feature-based resampling for protein structure prediction","publicationTitle":"IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","doi":"10.1109/CEC.2010.5586149","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","pdfPath":"/iel5/5573635/5585910/05586149.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CEC.2010.5586149","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5585910","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5586149","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5586149/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-23 July 2010","displayDocTitle":"Genetic algorithm feature-based resampling for protein structure prediction","conferenceDate":"18-23 July 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5586149/","dateOfInsertion":"27 September 2010","publicationDate":"July 2010","accessionNumber":"11568020","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Genetic algorithm feature-based resampling for protein structure prediction","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"C7451.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.141108S","chronDate":"18-23 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5573635","isNumber":"5585910","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5573635","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5585910","articleId":"5586149","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5586151,"authors":[{"name":"Zeratul Izzah Mohd Yusoh","affiliation":["Faculty of Science and Technology, Queensland University of Technology, Brisbane, Australia","Faculty of Information, Communication and Technology, Universiti Teknikal Malaysia Melaka, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Zeratul Izzah Mohd","lastName":"Yusoh","id":"38193137400"},{"name":"Maolin Tang","affiliation":["Faculty of Science and Technology, Queensland University of Technology, Brisbane, Australia"],"firstName":"Maolin","lastName":"Tang","id":"37276097900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6911-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6909-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6910-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-778X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0026"}],"articleNumber":"5586151","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":25,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":616},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Servers","Clouds","Biological cells","Equations","Mathematical model","Software","Computational modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","Internet"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["penalty-based genetic algorithm","composite SaaS placement problem","cloud computing","Internet","Software as a Service","data components","data centres"]}],"abstract":"Cloud computing is a latest new computing paradigm where applications, data and IT services are provided over the Internet. Cloud computing has become a main medium for Software as a Service (SaaS) providers to host their SaaS as it can provide the scalability a SaaS requires. The challenges in the composite SaaS placement process rely on several factors including the large size of the Cloud network, SaaS competing resource requirements, SaaS interactions between its components and SaaS interactions with its data components. However, existing applications' placement methods in data centres are not concerned with the placement of the component's data. In addition, a Cloud network is much larger than data center networks that have been discussed in existing studies.

This paper explores the ability of a cooperative combinatorial PSO (CCPSO) used in tandem with explicit diversity strategies to discover sets of high-quality and diverse solutions.

In this paper, a novel face detection algorithm based on Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) method for searching in the image is proposed. The algorithm uses a linear Support Vector Machine (SVM) as fast and accurate classifier and searches for a face in four dimensions: plane, orientation of the face, size of the face. Using PSO, the exhaustive search in all possible combinations of the 4D coordinates can be avoided, saving time and decreasing the computational complexity. Moreover, linear SVMs are proved to be a powerful and fast classifier for demanding applications.

It is about how to build a new value-added web service using existing web services. A web service may have many implementations, all of which have the same functionality, but may have different QoS values. Thus, a significant research problem in web service composition is how to select a web service implementation for each of the web services such that the composite web service gives the best overall performance. This is so-called optimal web service selection problem. There may be mutual constraints between some web service implementations. Sometimes when an implementation is selected for one web service, a particular implementation for another web service must be selected. This is so called dependency constraint. Sometimes when an implementation for one web service is selected, a set of implementations for another web service must be excluded in the web service composition. This is so called conflict constraint. Thus, the optimal web service selection is a typical constrained combinatorial optimization problem from the computational point of view. This paper proposes a new hybrid genetic algorithm for the optimal web service selection problem. The hybrid genetic algorithm has been implemented and evaluated. The evaluation results have shown that the hybrid genetic algorithm outperforms other two existing genetic algorithms when the number of web services and the number of constraints are large.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5586164/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-23 July 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"July 2010","accessionNumber":"11568035","htmlLink":"/document/5586164/","dateOfInsertion":"27 September 2010","conferenceDate":"18-23 July 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A hybrid genetic algorithm for the optimal constrained web service selection problem in web service composition","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A hybrid genetic algorithm for the optimal constrained web service selection problem in web service composition","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"C7457.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055068S","chronDate":"18-23 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5573635","isNumber":"5585910","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5573635","citationCount":"65","xplore-issue":"5585910","articleId":"5586164","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5586173,"authors":[{"name":"Kiran Khurshid","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, National University of Science and Technology, Islamabad, Pakistan"],"firstName":"Kiran","lastName":"Khurshid","id":"38196293600"},{"name":"Safwat Irteza","affiliation":["Military College of Signals, National University of Science and Technology, Islamabad, Pakistan"],"firstName":"Safwat","lastName":"Irteza","id":"37302954800"},{"name":"Adnan Ahmed Khan","affiliation":["National University of Science and Technology, Islamabad, Pakistan"],"firstName":"Adnan Ahmed","lastName":"Khan","id":"37536203900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6911-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6909-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6910-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-778X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0026"}],"articleNumber":"5586173","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":362},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Detectors","Complexity theory","Receivers","Optimization","Wireless communication","Multiplexing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","error statistics","maximum likelihood detection","MIMO communication","particle swarm optimisation","telecommunication computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ant colony optimization algorithm","MIMO symbol detection","ACO algorithm","multiinput multioutput system","NP-hard problem","swarm intelligence","maximum likelihood detector","ML detector","bit error rate","BER","VBLAST detectors","particle swarm optimisation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Spatial Multiplexing System","ACO","Multi-Input Multi-Output systems","symbol detection"]}],"abstract":"Ant colony optimization (ACO), inspired by the ants' foraging behavior, is one of the most recent techniques for solving optimization problems. We present an ACO based algorithm for symbol detection in multi-input multi-output (MIMO) system. Since symbol detection is an NP-hard problem so ACO is particularly attractive as ACO algorithms are one of the most successful strands of swarm intelligence and are suitable for applications where low complexity and fast convergence is of absolute importance. Maximum Likelihood (ML) detector gives optimal results but it uses exhaustive search technique. We show that ACO based detector can give near-optimal bit error rate (BER) at a much lower complexity level.

One interesting proposal to adapt the PSO for working in dynamic and noisy environments was the incorporation of an evaporation mechanism. The evaporation mechanism avoids the detection of environment changes, providing a continuous adaptation to the environment changes and reducing the effect when the fitness function is subject to noise. However, its performance decreases when the fitness function is not subjected to noise (with respect to methods that use environment change detection).

The problem is more aggravated when EAs are applied to search complex landscape of NP complete problem like protein structure prediction. In this paper, to help mitigate the problem of genetic drift and also to cover large search space, we propose a novel initial population generation process and a novel MA which applies clusters for seeding the initial population. Apart from reducing the impact of genetic drift, the proposed MA also avoids processing of unnecessary individuals in the population, thus significantly reducing the computational burden, especially for large protein sequences. Simulation results presented using the 2D lattice HP model show the superiority of the proposed algorithm.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Clustered memetic algorithm for protein structure prediction","publicationTitle":"IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","doi":"10.1109/CEC.2010.5586187","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","pdfPath":"/iel5/5573635/5585910/05586187.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CEC.2010.5586187","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5585910","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5586187","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5586187/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-23 July 2010","displayDocTitle":"Clustered memetic algorithm for protein structure prediction","conferenceDate":"18-23 July 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5586187/","dateOfInsertion":"27 September 2010","publicationDate":"July 2010","accessionNumber":"11568056","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Clustered memetic algorithm for protein structure prediction","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"C7555.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07338S","chronDate":"18-23 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5573635","isNumber":"5585910","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5573635","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"5585910","articleId":"5586187","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":5586190,"authors":[{"name":"Tiago Silveira","affiliation":["Laboratory of Computational Intelligence (LInC), Department of Exact Sciences, Federal University of Alfenas, Brazil"],"firstName":"Tiago","lastName":"Silveira","id":"38196342500"},{"name":"Humberto C.

Recently, several works in the literature suggested that computational intelligence can provide effective solutions to support the development process of NPCs. In this paper, we applied the Behavior Analysis and Training (BAT) methodology to define a behavior-based architecture for the NPCs in The Open Racing Car Simulator (TORCS), a well-known open source racing game. Then, we focused on two major overtaking behaviors: (i) the overtaking of a fast opponent either on a straight stretch or on a large bend; (ii) the overtaking on a tight bend, which typically requires a rather advanced braking policy. We applied simple reinforcement learning, namely Q-learning, to learn both these overtaking behaviors. We tested our approach in several overtaking situations and compared the learned behaviors against one of the best NPC provided with TORCS. Our results suggest that, exploiting the proposed behavior-based architecture, Q-learning can effectively learn sophisticated behaviors and outperform programmed NPCs. In addition, we also show that the same approach can be successfully applied to adapt a previously learned behavior to a dynamically changing game situation.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5585910","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CEC.2010.5586191","publicationTitle":"IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","pdfPath":"/iel5/5573635/5585910/05586191.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","doi":"10.1109/CEC.2010.5586191","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Learning to overtake in TORCS using simple reinforcement learning","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-23 July 2010","displayDocTitle":"Learning to overtake in TORCS using simple reinforcement learning","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"18-23 July 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5586191/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2010","accessionNumber":"11568057","dateOfInsertion":"27 September 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5586191/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Learning to overtake in TORCS using simple reinforcement learning","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"C7799.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.109911S","chronDate":"18-23 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5573635","isNumber":"5585910","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5573635","citationCount":"32","xplore-issue":"5585910","articleId":"5586191","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-11"},{"_id":5586203,"authors":[{"name":"Slim Bechikh","affiliation":["Intelligent Information Engineering Laboratory, High Institute of Management of Tunis, University of Tunis, Tunisia"],"firstName":"Slim","lastName":"Bechikh","id":"37402092800"},{"name":"Lamjed Ben Said","affiliation":["Intelligent Information Engineering Laboratory, High Institute of Management of Tunis, University of Tunis, Tunisia"],"firstName":"Lamjed","lastName":"Ben Said","id":"37402094700"},{"name":"Khaled Ghedira","affiliation":["Intelligent Information Engineering Laboratory, High Institute of Management of Tunis, University of Tunis, Tunisia"],"firstName":"Khaled","lastName":"Ghedira","id":"37300095900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6911-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6909-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6910-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-778X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0026"}],"articleNumber":"5586203","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":16,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":952},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Estimation","Search problems","Memetics","Delta modulation","Optimization","Convergence","Mobile communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decision making","evolutionary computation","gradient methods","Pareto optimisation","search problems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nadir point estimation","mobile reference point","decision maker","Pareto optimal solution","memetic preference-based multiobjective evolutionary algorithm","MR-NSGA-IIN","gradient-based local search procedure"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5586203","abstract":"Nadir point represents important information to multi-objective optimization practitioners.

Clustering algorithms can be very sensitive with respect to the set of features (genes) considered in the clustering process. It is important to select the set of informative and relevant genes to be used for clustering. In this article, a multiobjective genetic algorithm based technique has been proposed for performing the tasks of gene selection and fuzzy clustering simultaneously. A novel encoding technique is developed in this regard and the algorithm searches for the best cluster centers while minimizing the number of selected genes. The number of clusters is evolved automatically. The performance of the proposed technique has been illustrated on an artificial data set and compared with that of several other related feature selection/clustering approaches. Moreover its performance is demonstrated on two real life multi-class gene expression data sets viz., Brain tumor and Lung tumor data sets.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Tumors","Biological cells","Indexes","Clustering algorithms","Lungs","Cancer","Gene expression"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bioinformatics","encoding","genetic algorithms","genomics","medical computing","pattern classification","pattern clustering","tumours"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["informative gene selection","informative gene clustering","multiobjective optimization","fuzzy clustering","tumor subclass classification","microarray gene expression","artificial data set","multiobjective genetic algorithm","encoding technique","unsupervised classification"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5586207","doi":"10.1109/CEC.2010.5586207","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","publicationTitle":"IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","pdfPath":"/iel5/5573635/5585910/05586207.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5585910","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CEC.2010.5586207","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5586207/","displayDocTitle":"Simultaneous informative gene selection and clustering through multiobjective optimization","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"18-23 July 2010","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2010","dateOfInsertion":"27 September 2010","accessionNumber":"11568076","htmlLink":"/document/5586207/","conferenceDate":"18-23 July 2010","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Simultaneous informative gene selection and clustering through multiobjective optimization","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"C7129.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074415S","chronDate":"18-23 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5573635","isNumber":"5585910","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5573635","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5585910","articleId":"5586207","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5586209,"authors":[{"name":"Asmaa Al-Naqi","affiliation":["School of Engineering and Electronics, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK"],"firstName":"Asmaa","lastName":"Al-Naqi","id":"38277298100"},{"name":"Ahmet T.

The first phase is based on a sequence based genetic algorithm (SBGA) with an embedded local search scheme. Within the SBGA, a memory is introduced to store good sequences (sub-tours) extracted from previous good solutions and the stored sequences are used to guide the generation of offspring via local search during the evolution of the population. Additionally, we also apply some techniques to adapt the key parameters based on whether the best individual of the population improves or not and maintain the diversity. After SBGA finishes, the hybrid approach enters the second phase, where the inver over (IO) operator, which is a state-of-the-art algorithm for the TSP, is used to further improve the solution quality of the population. Experiments are carried out to investigate the performance of the proposed hybrid approach in comparison with several relevant algorithms on a set of benchmark TSP instances. The experimental results show that the proposed hybrid approach is efficient in finding good quality solutions for the test TSPs.","doi":"10.1109/CEC.2010.5586216","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","pdfPath":"/iel5/5573635/5585910/05586216.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CEC.2010.5586216","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5585910","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A hybrid genetic algorithm and inver over approach for the travelling salesman problem","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cities and towns","Traveling salesman problems","Optimization","Benchmark testing","Genomics","Bioinformatics","Convergence"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","search problems","travelling salesman problems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hybrid genetic algorithm","inver over approach","travelling salesman problem","sequence based genetic algorithm","embedded local search scheme"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5586216/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-23 July 2010","displayDocTitle":"A hybrid genetic algorithm and inver over approach for the travelling salesman problem","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5586216/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2010","dateOfInsertion":"27 September 2010","conferenceDate":"18-23 July 2010","accessionNumber":"11568085","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A hybrid genetic algorithm and inver over approach for the travelling salesman problem","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"C7158.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.124264S","chronDate":"18-23 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5573635","isNumber":"5585910","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5573635","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5585910","articleId":"5586216","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":5586221,"authors":[{"name":"Upali K.

To test the performance of ALPSO-II, we choose a set of 27 test problems, including un-rotated, shifted, rotated, rotated shifted, and composition functions in comparison of the ALPSO algorithm as well as several state-of-the-art variant PSO algorithms.

For a fixed optimization problem, the quality of the found solution depends significantly on the choice of the algorithmic PSO parameters such as the inertia weight and the acceleration coefficients. It is a challenging task to choose appropriate values for these parameters by hand or mathematically. In this paper, a novel self-optimizing particle swarm optimizer with multiple adaptation layers is introduced. In the new algorithm, adaptation takes place on both particle and subswarm level. The new idea of using virtual parameter swarms which hold modifiable parameter configurations each is introduced. The algorithmic PSO parameters can be mutated by using, for instance, well-known techniques from the field of evolutionary algorithms, in order to allow fine-granular parameter adaptation to the problem at hand. The new algorithm is experimentally evaluated, and compared to a standard PSO and the Tribes algorithm. The experimental study shows that our new algorithm is highly competitive to previously suggested approaches.","doi":"10.1109/CEC.2010.5586255","pdfPath":"/iel5/5573635/5585910/05586255.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","publicationTitle":"IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CEC.2010.5586255","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5585910","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design and experimental evaluation of multiple adaptation layers in self-optimizing particle swarm optimization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5586255/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-23 July 2010","displayDocTitle":"Design and experimental evaluation of multiple adaptation layers in self-optimizing particle swarm optimization","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"27 September 2010","accessionNumber":"11568125","publicationDate":"July 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5586255/","conferenceDate":"18-23 July 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design and experimental evaluation of multiple adaptation layers in self-optimizing particle swarm optimization","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"C7109.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.09784S","chronDate":"18-23 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5573635","isNumber":"5585910","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5573635","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5585910","articleId":"5586255","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5586257,"authors":[{"name":"Rui Xu","affiliation":["Applied Computational Intelligence Laboratory, Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering, Missouri University of Science and Technology, Rolla, MO, USA"],"firstName":"Rui","lastName":"Xu","id":"37285993500"},{"name":"Jie Xu","affiliation":["Department of Industrial Engineering & Management Sciences, Northwestern University, Evanston, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Jie","lastName":"Xu","id":"37404863900"},{"name":"Donald C.

Although, objective and constraint violations evaluations are embarassingly parallel, other algorithmic and code optimizations have been proposed and tested. The bottlenecks in a parallel GA implementation are identified and modified suitably. The results are compared with the sequential algorithm on accuracy and clock time for varying problems by studying the effect of a number of parameters, namely: (i) population sizes, (ii) number of threads, (iii) problem sizes, and (iv) problems of differing complexities.

However, how to improve the degree of accuracy so as to produce high quality solutions is still one of the main difficulties that RCGAs face with. This paper proposes a novel mutation scheme for RCGAs. The mutation operator is defined as a linear map in the space of chromosomes (in RCGAs each chromosome is a floating point vector). It operates on a whole chromosome instead of several single genes to produce the new chromosome. The linear map is represented by a randomly generated mapping matrix which satisfies some predefined constraints. By this way, the constraints restrict the mutations of genes on a same chromosome as a whole. RCGA with the proposed mutation scheme is tested on 16 benchmark functions. Results demonstrate that the proposed scheme not only improves the solution accuracy that RCGA can obtain, but also presents a very fast convergence speed. The linear map-based mutation scheme has a bright future to improve RCGAs.","doi":"10.1109/CEC.2010.5586270","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","pdfPath":"/iel5/5573635/5585910/05586270.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CEC.2010.5586270","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5585910","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A linear map-based mutation scheme for real coded genetic algorithms","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Biological cells","Vectors","Benchmark testing","Convergence","Accuracy","Encoding","Genetics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biocybernetics","cellular biophysics","genetic algorithms","genetics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["linear map based mutation","real coded genetic algorithm","continuous optimization problem","chromosome space","randomly generated mapping matrix","gene mutation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5586270/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-23 July 2010","displayDocTitle":"A linear map-based mutation scheme for real coded genetic algorithms","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5586270/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2010","dateOfInsertion":"27 September 2010","conferenceDate":"18-23 July 2010","accessionNumber":"11568139","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A linear map-based mutation scheme for real coded genetic algorithms","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"C7205.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.079105S","chronDate":"18-23 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5573635","isNumber":"5585910","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5573635","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5585910","articleId":"5586270","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5586274,"authors":[{"name":"R.

In this paper, a generalized polynomial value function has been proposed and the procedure to fit the value function to the decision maker's preference information has been described. The generality of the procedure of fitting a value function to the decision maker's preferences has been shown by using other existing value functions from the literature. The proposed generic polynomial value function has been incorporated in the PI-EMO-VF algorithm to efficiently approximate the decision maker's value function. The paper then evaluates the performance of the PI-EMO-VF algorithm on three and five objective test problems with constraints. It also evaluates the efficacy of the procedure in producing the most preferred solution when the decision maker is unable to provide perfect information, i.e., the decision maker finds certain pairs of solutions in the objective space to be incomparable.

They have carved out a niche for themselves in solving optimization problems of varying difficulty levels involving single and multiple objectives. Most real-world optimization problems involve equality and / or inequality constraints and hence posed as constrained optimization problems. The most common approach to solve such problems using GAs is the method of penalty functions, which however suffers from the drawback of appropriate selection of penalty parameters for their optimal functioning. Given the nature of the problems at hand, we have used an adaptive mutation based Real-Coded GA (RGA), which uses a popular penalty parameter-less approach to handle constraints and search the feasible region effectively for the global best solution, and at the same time use an adaptive mutation strategy to maintain diversity in the population to enable creation of new solutions. We have coupled our RGA with ideas from the gradient projection method to specifically handle equality constraints. We have found our simple procedure working quite well in most of the test problems provided as part of the competition on Single-objective Constrained Real Parameter Optimization in CEC 2010 and hence simplicity remains the hallmark of our study here.","doi":"10.1109/CEC.2010.5586303","pdfPath":"/iel5/5573635/5585910/05586303.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","publicationTitle":"IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CEC.2010.5586303","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5585910","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hybrid gradient projection based Genetic Algorithms for constrained optimization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5586303/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-23 July 2010","displayDocTitle":"Hybrid gradient projection based Genetic Algorithms for constrained optimization","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"27 September 2010","accessionNumber":"11567560","publicationDate":"July 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5586303/","conferenceDate":"18-23 July 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hybrid gradient projection based Genetic Algorithms for constrained optimization","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"C8001.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068085S","chronDate":"18-23 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5573635","isNumber":"5585910","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5573635","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"5585910","articleId":"5586303","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":5586306,"authors":[{"name":"Narayanan Kumarappan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Annamalai University, Tamil Nadu, India"],"firstName":"Narayanan","lastName":"Kumarappan","id":"37550619100"},{"name":"Kaliyamoorthy Suresh","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Sri Manakula Vinayagar Engineering College, Pondicherry, India"],"firstName":"Kaliyamoorthy","lastName":"Suresh","id":"37647103900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6911-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6909-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6910-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-778X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0026"}],"articleNumber":"5586306","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":185},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5586306","abstract":"Preventive Maintenance Scheduling of generating units is an important requirement in a power system planning.

missions remains very challenging. Most approaches reported so far relies on key assumptions and heuristic procedures to reduce problem complexity. In this paper, a new model and a hybrid genetic algorithm are proposed to solve the rescue path planning problem for a single vehicle navigating in uncertain adversarial environment. We present a simplified mathematical linear programming formulation aimed at minimizing traveled distance and threat exposure. As an approximation to the basic problem, the user-defined model allows to specify a lower bound on the optimal solution for some particular survivability conditions. Hard problem instances are then solved using a novel hybrid genetic algorithm relaxing some of the common assumptions considered by previous path construction methods. The algorithm evolves a population of solution combining genetic operators with a new stochastic path generation technique, providing guided local search, while improving solution quality. The value of the problem-solving approach is shown for simple cases and compared to an alternate heuristic.","doi":"10.1109/CEC.2010.5586311","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","publicationTitle":"IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CEC.2010.5586311","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5585910","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","pdfPath":"/iel5/5573635/5585910/05586311.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A hybrid genetic algorithm for rescue path planning in uncertain adversarial environment","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5586311/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A hybrid genetic algorithm for rescue path planning in uncertain adversarial environment","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5586311/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11567564","publicationDate":"July 2010","dateOfInsertion":"27 September 2010","conferenceDate":"18-23 July 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-23 July 2010","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A hybrid genetic algorithm for rescue path planning in uncertain adversarial environment","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"C7243.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060962S","chronDate":"18-23 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5573635","isNumber":"5585910","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5573635","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5585910","articleId":"5586311","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5586312,"authors":[{"name":"Alejandro Flores-Mendez","affiliation":["Mathematics Department, CINVESTAV, Mexico"],"firstName":"Alejandro","lastName":"Flores-Mendez","id":"38270553500"},{"name":"Manuel Bernal-Urbina","affiliation":["Ijam Consulting"],"firstName":"Manuel","lastName":"Bernal-Urbina","id":"38270480700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6911-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6909-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6910-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-778X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0026"}],"articleNumber":"5586312","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":177},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5586312","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Forgery","Proposals","Genetic algorithms","Polynomials","Azimuth","Finite element methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital signatures","genetic algorithms","handwriting recognition","learning (artificial intelligence)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dynamic signature verification","longest common subsequence problem","genetic algorithm","biometric verification","online signature verification"]}],"doi":"10.1109/CEC.2010.5586312","pdfPath":"/iel5/5573635/5585910/05586312.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5585910","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CEC.2010.5586312","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamic signature verification through the Longest Common Subsequence Problem and Genetic Algorithms","abstract":"The following paper includes an automated system that shows the use of signature data for biometric verification.

The whole PSO population is divided into a large number sub-swarms which is also the individual HS population. These sub-swarms are regrouped frequently by using various regrouping schedules and information is exchanged among the particles in the whole swarm. Therefore, different from the existing multi-swarm PSOs or local versions of PSO, our sub-swarms are dynamic and its size is small which is also appropriate to be the population of the harmony search. In addition, an external memory of selected past solutions is used to enhance the diversity of the swarm.

Most established multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) have mechanisms that address these requirements. However, in many-objective optimisation, where the number of objectives is greater than 2 or 3, it has been found that these two requirements can conflict with one another, introducing problems such as dominance resistance and speciation. In this study, a previously introduced diversity management mechanism is deployed within a Progressive Preference Articulation (PPA) technique to optimise an 8-objective real-world problem of aircraft control system design. This paper illustrates the effective application of the new diversity management mechanism used in conjunction with the PPA technique when optimising a multiobjective real-world engineering problem.","doi":"10.1109/CEC.2010.5586338","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","publicationTitle":"IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CEC.2010.5586338","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5585910","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","pdfPath":"/iel5/5573635/5585910/05586338.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Progressive diversity management in evolutionary multiobjective optimisation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5586338/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Progressive diversity management in evolutionary multiobjective optimisation","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5586338/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11567595","publicationDate":"July 2010","dateOfInsertion":"27 September 2010","conferenceDate":"18-23 July 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-23 July 2010","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Progressive diversity management in evolutionary multiobjective optimisation","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"C7078.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.083795S","chronDate":"18-23 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5573635","isNumber":"5585910","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5573635","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5585910","articleId":"5586338","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5586339,"authors":[{"name":"Santi S.

However, due to the dimensionality problem (less samples and large number of genes) of microarray data, obtaining an optimal gene regulatory network is not only difficult but also computationally expensive. In this paper, a Bayesian model for the genetic interactions using the Minimum Description Length as a scoring metric is proposed. For fast optimisation of the network structure, we propose a novel Swarm Intelligence algorithm called Binary-Organoid Particle Swarm (BORG-Swarm). In BORG-Swarm we introduce the concepts of probability threshold vector and particle drift to update particle positions. Experimental studies are carried out using real-life yeast cell cycle dataset. Results indicate that existing binary swarms fail to converge and suffer from long runtimes. In constrast, BORG-Swarm's fast convergence towards the global optimum becomes apparent from results of extensive simulations.","doi":"10.1109/CEC.2010.5586339","startPage":"1","endPage":"10","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","pdfPath":"/iel5/5573635/5585910/05586339.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CEC.2010.5586339","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5585910","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Binary-Organoid Particle Swarm optimisation for inferring genetic networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Particle swarm optimization","Mathematical model","Measurement","Gene expression","Optimization","Equations","Data models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["artificial intelligence","Bayes methods","biology computing","data handling","genetic algorithms","genetics","particle swarm optimisation","probability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["binary-organoid particle swarm optimisation","genetic network","genetic interaction","complex biological system","dimensionality problem","microarray data","optimal gene regulatory network","Bayesian model","minimum description length","scoring metric","network structure","swarm intelligence algorithm","BORG-swarm algorithm","probability threshold vector","particle drift","real-life yeast cell cycle dataset"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5586339/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-23 July 2010","displayDocTitle":"Binary-Organoid Particle Swarm optimisation for inferring genetic networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5586339/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2010","dateOfInsertion":"27 September 2010","conferenceDate":"18-23 July 2010","accessionNumber":"11567596","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Binary-Organoid Particle Swarm optimisation for inferring genetic networks","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"C8005.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.121524S","chronDate":"18-23 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5573635","isNumber":"5585910","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5573635","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5585910","articleId":"5586339","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":5586341,"authors":[{"name":"Bo-Yang Qu","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Bo-Yang","lastName":"Qu","id":"37710395100"},{"name":"Ponnuthurai Nagaratnam Suganthan","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Ponnuthurai Nagaratnam","lastName":"Suganthan","id":"37275664500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6911-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6909-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6910-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-778X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0026"}],"articleNumber":"5586341","dbTime":"33 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":46,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":484},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5586341","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optimization","Algorithm design and analysis","Benchmark testing","Euclidean distance","Classification algorithms","Chromium","Programming"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["evolutionary computation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["differential evolution","multimodal optimization","local optimal solution","niching technique","ensemble of restricted tournament selection algorithm"]}],"doi":"10.1109/CEC.2010.5586341","publicationTitle":"IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","pdfPath":"/iel5/5573635/5585910/05586341.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CEC.2010.5586341","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5585910","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Novel multimodal problems and differential evolution with ensemble of restricted tournament selection","abstract":"Multi-modal optimization refers to locating not only one optimum but a set of locally optimal solutions.

A `species-based evolutionary algorithm' (SEA) is the combination of a species conservation technique with an evolutionary algorithm, such as genetic algorithms, particle swarm optimization, or differential evolution. These SEAs have been demonstrated to be effective in searching multiple solutions of a multimodal optimization problem.

Results obtained by the proposed approach are very competitive with respect to other comparator algorithms already developed for constrained optimization and testify that the new algorithm can be regarded as an efficient tool for optimization in the presence of constraints.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5585910","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CEC.2010.5586364","publicationTitle":"IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","pdfPath":"/iel5/5573635/5585910/05586364.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","doi":"10.1109/CEC.2010.5586364","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new algorithm for constrained optimization inspired by the sport league championships","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-23 July 2010","displayDocTitle":"A new algorithm for constrained optimization inspired by the sport league championships","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"18-23 July 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5586364/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2010","accessionNumber":"11567621","dateOfInsertion":"27 September 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5586364/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new algorithm for constrained optimization inspired by the sport league championships","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"C7928.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06274S","chronDate":"18-23 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5573635","isNumber":"5585910","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5573635","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"5585910","articleId":"5586364","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5586369,"authors":[{"name":"Jean Berger","affiliation":["Defence Research and Development Canada, Quebec, QUE, Canada"],"firstName":"Jean","lastName":"Berger","id":"37381726900"},{"name":"Jens Happe","affiliation":["MacDonald Dettwiler and Associates Limited, Richmond, BC, Canada"],"firstName":"Jens","lastName":"Happe","id":"37595698200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6911-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6909-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6910-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-778X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0026"}],"articleNumber":"5586369","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":440},"abstract":"Mobile cooperative sensor networks are increasingly used for surveillance and reconnaissance tasks to support domain picture compilation. However, efficient distributed information gathering such as target search by a team of autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) remains very challenging in constrained environment. In this paper, we propose a new approach to learn resource-bounded multi-agent coordination for a multi-UAV target search problem subject to stringent communication bandwidth constraints in a dynamic uncertain environment. It relies on a new information-theoretic co-evolutionary algorithm to solve cooperative search path planning over receding horizons, providing agents with mutually adaptive and self-organizing behavior. The anytime coordination algorithm is coupled to a divergence-based information-sharing policy to exchange high-value world-state information under limited communication bandwidth. Computational results show the value of the proposed approach in comparison to a well-known reported technique.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","pdfPath":"/iel5/5573635/5585910/05586369.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","publicationTitle":"IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","doi":"10.1109/CEC.2010.5586369","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CEC.2010.5586369","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5585910","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5586369","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Co-evolutionary search path planning under constrained information-sharing for a cooperative unmanned aerial vehicle team","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Path planning","Planning","Search problems","Bandwidth","Entropy","Unmanned aerial vehicles","Joints"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["evolutionary computation","multi-agent systems","path planning","remotely operated vehicles","search problems","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["co-evolutionary search path planning","constrained information-sharing","cooperative unmanned aerial vehicle team","mobile cooperative sensor networks","surveillance","reconnaissance","resource-bounded multi-agent coordination","search problem","communication bandwidth","information exchange"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5586369/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-23 July 2010","displayDocTitle":"Co-evolutionary search path planning under constrained information-sharing for a cooperative unmanned aerial vehicle team","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5586369/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2010","accessionNumber":"11567626","dateOfInsertion":"27 September 2010","conferenceDate":"18-23 July 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Co-evolutionary search path planning under constrained information-sharing for a cooperative unmanned aerial vehicle team","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"C7065.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050052S","chronDate":"18-23 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5573635","isNumber":"5585910","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5573635","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"5585910","articleId":"5586369","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":5586376,"authors":[{"name":"Cristiana Bolchini","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Elettronica e Informazione, Politecnico di Milano, Milano, Italy"],"firstName":"Cristiana","lastName":"Bolchini","id":"37273944700"},{"name":"Pier Luca Lanzi","affiliation":["Illinois Genetic Algorithm Laboratory, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, IL, USA","Dipartimento di Elettronica e Informazione, Politecnico di Milano, Milano, Italy"],"firstName":"Pier Luca","lastName":"Lanzi","id":"37352642300"},{"name":"Antonio Miele","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Elettronica e Informazione, Politecnico di Milano, Milano, Italy"],"firstName":"Antonio","lastName":"Miele","id":"37273951700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6911-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6909-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6910-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-778X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0026"}],"articleNumber":"5586376","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":203},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Reliability engineering","Field programmable gate arrays","Integrated circuit reliability","Tunneling magnetoresistance","Measurement","Space exploration"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","genetic algorithms","integrated circuit design","Pareto optimisation","simulated annealing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiobjective genetic algorithm","space exploration design","FPGA system","design metrix","Pareto optimal design solution","simulated annealing","real world circuit","synthetic problem","suboptimal solution","scalability analysis"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents a framework for the design space exploration of reliable FPGA systems based on a multi-objective genetic algorithm (NSGA-II).

Innately Split Model (ISM) is one of promising approaches to enhance RCGAs where a set of population groups are evolved in parallel and groups are re-initialized if two groups searches a similar region (it is called redundant searches). In this paper, we propose a new strategy for the re-initialization of groups to improve the performance of ISM. In our method, redundant searches are detected by using the information of the search histories of the groups. This information is called traps and is stored as a set of hyper-ellipsoids representing the distributions of the previous groups. We demonstrate that the proposed method is robust and superior to the original ISM.","doi":"10.1109/CEC.2010.5586386","pdfPath":"/iel5/5573635/5585910/05586386.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","publicationTitle":"IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CEC.2010.5586386","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5585910","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Globally multimodal function optimization by Real-Coded Genetic Algorithms using traps","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5586386/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-23 July 2010","displayDocTitle":"Globally multimodal function optimization by Real-Coded Genetic Algorithms using traps","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"27 September 2010","accessionNumber":"11567641","publicationDate":"July 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5586386/","conferenceDate":"18-23 July 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Globally multimodal function optimization by Real-Coded Genetic Algorithms using traps","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"C8012.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.0623S","chronDate":"18-23 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5573635","isNumber":"5585910","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5573635","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5585910","articleId":"5586386","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5586397,"authors":[{"name":"Severus Sheetekela","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Cape Town, South Africa"],"firstName":"Severus","lastName":"Sheetekela","id":"37590234900"},{"name":"Komla Agbenyo Folly","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Cape Town, South Africa"],"firstName":"Komla Agbenyo","lastName":"Folly","id":"37275954500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6911-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6909-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6910-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-778X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0026"}],"articleNumber":"5586397","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":152},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Damping","Power system stability","Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","Genetics","Evolutionary computation","Genetic algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","genetic algorithms","power system stability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["breeder genetic algorithm","power system stabilizer design","evolutionary algorithm","eigenvalue based objective function","electromechanical modes","time domain simulations"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5586397","abstract":"This paper presents the design of Power System Stabilizers (PSSs) using two Evolutionary Algorithm (EA) techniques, namely; Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Breeder Genetic Algorithm. BGA is a new form of evolutionary algorithm, which is based on the idea of survival of the fittest, but differs from the traditional Genetic Algorithm due to its artificial breeding nature. An eigenvalue based objective function is used in the design of the PSSs whereby the algorithms maximize the lowest damping ratio over specified operating conditions. For comparison purpose, the Conventional PSS (CPSS) is also included. The performance and effectiveness of the PSSs in damping the electromechanical modes is investigated. Eigenvalue analysis and time domain simulations show that BGA-PSS and GA-PSS perform better than the CPSS for all the operating conditions considered except at the nominal operating condition. However, BGA-PSS performs slightly better than the GA-PSS.","doi":"10.1109/CEC.2010.5586397","pdfPath":"/iel5/5573635/5585910/05586397.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","publicationTitle":"IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CEC.2010.5586397","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5585910","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Breeder Genetic Algorithm for Power System Stabilizer design","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5586397/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-23 July 2010","displayDocTitle":"Breeder Genetic Algorithm for Power System Stabilizer design","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"27 September 2010","accessionNumber":"11567653","publicationDate":"July 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5586397/","conferenceDate":"18-23 July 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Breeder Genetic Algorithm for Power System Stabilizer design","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"C7298.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057282S","chronDate":"18-23 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5573635","isNumber":"5585910","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5573635","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5585910","articleId":"5586397","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":5586405,"authors":[{"name":"Jun Inagaki","affiliation":["Department of Information Network Engineering, Hokkaido Institute of Technology, Sapporo, Japan"],"firstName":"Jun","lastName":"Inagaki","id":"37414510500"},{"name":"Tomoaki Shirakawa","affiliation":["Department of Human Science and Informatics, Tokai University, Sapporo, Japan"],"firstName":"Tomoaki","lastName":"Shirakawa","id":"38196250000"},{"name":"Tetsuo Shimono","affiliation":["Department of Human Science and Informatics, Tokai University, Sapporo, Japan"],"firstName":"Tetsuo","lastName":"Shimono","id":"38196282900"},{"name":"Miki Haseyama","affiliation":["Graduate School of Information Science and Technology, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, Japan"],"firstName":"Miki","lastName":"Haseyama","id":"37270820400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6911-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6909-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6910-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-778X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0026"}],"articleNumber":"5586405","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":66},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5586405","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Biological cells","Arrays","Routing","Search problems","Electronic mail","Redundancy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","mesh generation","search problems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithm","path generation","mesh map","optimization problem","grid square map","cost minimization","exhaustive search"]}],"doi":"10.1109/CEC.2010.5586405","pdfPath":"/iel5/5573635/5585910/05586405.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5585910","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CEC.2010.5586405","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A genetic algorithm for generating multiple paths on mesh maps","abstract":"Path generation is an optimization problem mainly performed on grid square maps that combines generation of paths with minimization of their cost.

This paper presents a method of representing, eliciting and integrating decision making preference expressed as a set of imprecise goal vectors into a MOEA with steady-state replacement. The specification of a precise goal vector without extensive knowledge of problem behavior often leads to undesirable results. The approach proposed in this paper facilitates the linguistic specification of goal vectors relative to extreme, non-dominated solutions (i.e. the goal is specified as \u201dVery Small\u201d, \u201dSmall\u201d, \u201dMedium\u201d, \u201dLarge\u201d, and \u201dVery Large\u201d) with three degrees of imprecision as desired by the decision maker. The degree of imprecision corresponds to the density of solutions desired within the target subset.

A challenge is to find optimal mobile agent routes for minimizing the data path loss and the sensors energy consumption as well as maximizing the data accuracy. Existing approaches deal with the objectives individually, or by optimizing one and constraining the others or by combining them into a single objective. This often results in missing \u201cgood\u201d tradeoff solutions. Only few approaches have tackled the Mobile Agent-based Distributed Sensor Network Routing problem as a Multiobjective Optimization Problem (MOP) using conventional Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithms (MOEAs). It is well known that the incorporation of problem specific knowledge in MOEAs is a difficult task. In this paper, we propose a problem-specific MOEA based on Decomposition (MOEA/D) for optimizing the three objectives. Experimental studies have shown that the proposed problem-specific approach performs better than two conventional MOEAs in several WSN test instances.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Mobile agents","Wireless sensor networks","IP networks","Routing","Energy consumption","Accuracy","Clustering algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data communication","evolutionary computation","mobile agents","network routing","object detection","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mobile agent based sensor network","network routing","MOEA/D","decomposition based MOEA","multiobjective evolutionary algorithm","wireless sensor network","distributed target detection","data path loss minimization","energy consumption","multiobjective optimization problem","WSN"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5585910","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CEC.2010.5586431","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","publicationTitle":"IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","pdfPath":"/iel5/5573635/5585910/05586431.pdf","doi":"10.1109/CEC.2010.5586431","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-objective mobile agent-based Sensor Network Routing using MOEA/D","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Multi-objective mobile agent-based Sensor Network Routing using MOEA/D","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11567686","publicationDate":"July 2010","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"18-23 July 2010","dateOfInsertion":"27 September 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5586431/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5586431/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-23 July 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-objective mobile agent-based Sensor Network Routing using MOEA/D","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"C7618.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.11107S","chronDate":"18-23 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5573635","isNumber":"5585910","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5573635","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"5585910","articleId":"5586431","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":5586440,"authors":[{"name":"Geoff Huston","affiliation":["APNIC, Canberra, Australia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/5586433/5586440/5586440-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Geoff Huston holds a B.Sc. and a M.Sc. from the Australian National University.

We show how PED impacts on convergence time compared to currently deployed mechanisms like Route Flap Damping (RFD), Minimum Route Advertisement Interval (MRAI) and Withdrawal Rate Limiting (WRATE). We replay Internet BGP update traffic captured at two Autonomous Systems to observe that a PED-enabled BGP speaker can reduce the total number of BGP announcements by up to 32% and reduce Path Exploration by 77% compared to conventional use of MRAI. We also describe how PED can be incrementally deployed in the Internet, as it interacts well with prevailing MRAI deployment, and enables restoration of reachability more quickly than MRAI.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5586433","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2010.101005","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/49/5586433/05586440.pdf","startPage":"1271","endPage":"1286","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2010.101005","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Technique for Reducing BGP Update Announcements through Path Exploration Damping","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"October  2010","displayDocTitle":"A Technique for Reducing BGP Update Announcements through Path Exploration Damping","volume":"28","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/5586440/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"October 2010","accessionNumber":"11556754","dateOfInsertion":"27 September 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5586440/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 September 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Technique for Reducing BGP Update Announcements through Path Exploration Damping","sourcePdf":"1271jsac0810huston.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.069003S","chronDate":"October  2010","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"5586433","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"5586433","articleId":"5586440","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5586465,"authors":[{"name":"Huajin Tang","affiliation":["Institute of Infocomm Research, Agency of Science, Agency for Science, Technology and Research, Singapore"],"firstName":"Huajin","lastName":"Tang","id":"37274558400"},{"name":"Vui Ann Shim","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"firstName":"Vui Ann","lastName":"Shim","id":"37072093500"},{"name":"Kay Chen Tan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"firstName":"Kay Chen","lastName":"Tan","id":"37334471700"},{"name":"Jun Yong Chia","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"firstName":"Jun Yong","lastName":"Chia","id":"38196400000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6911-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6909-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6910-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-778X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0026"}],"articleNumber":"5586465","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":20,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":573},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Clustering algorithms","Optimization","Joints","Training","Probability distribution","Probabilistic logic","Measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Boltzmann machines","optimisation","stochastic processes","unsupervised learning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["restricted Boltzmann machine","multiobjective optimization algorithm","stochastic neural network","unsupervised learning","thermal equilibrium","canonical operators","phenotype space"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5586465","abstract":"Restricted Boltzmann machine is an energy-based stochastic neural network with unsupervised learning. This network consists of a layer of hidden unit and visible unit in an undirected generative network. In this paper, restricted Boltzmann machine is modeled as estimation of distribution algorithm in the context of multi-objective optimization. The probabilities of the joint configuration over the visible and hidden units in the network are trained until the distribution over the global state reach a certain degree of thermal equilibrium. Subsequently, the probabilistic model is constructed using the energy function of the network.

The effects on the stability of the trained network and clustering in optimization are rigorously examined.

Two main mechanisms which contribute towards the success of the algorithms are probabilistic modeling and sampling method. Recent attention has been directed towards the development of probabilistic building technique. However, research on the sampling approach is less developed. Thus, this paper carries out an investigation on sampling technique for a novel multi-objective estimation of distribution algorithm - multi-objective restricted Boltzmann machine. Two variants of a new sampling technique based on energy value of the solutions in the trained network are proposed to improve the efficiency of the algorithm. Probabilistic information which is usually clamped into marginal probability distribution may hinder the algorithm in producing solutions that have high linkage dependency between variables. The proposed approach will overcome this limitation of probabilistic modeling in restricted Boltzmann machine. The empirical investigation shows that the proposed algorithm gives promising result in term of convergence and convergence rate.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Probabilistic logic","Convergence","Algorithm design and analysis","Training","Couplings","Probability distribution","Computational modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Boltzmann machines","convergence","probability","sampling methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sampling technique","multiobjective restricted Boltzmann machine","distribution algorithms estimation","linkage information exploration","probabilistic modeling","probabilistic building technique","trained network","convergence"]}],"doi":"10.1109/CEC.2010.5586469","publicationTitle":"IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","pdfPath":"/iel5/5573635/5585910/05586469.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5585910","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CEC.2010.5586469","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An investigation on sampling technique for multi-objective restricted Boltzmann machine","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5586469","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"An investigation on sampling technique for multi-objective restricted Boltzmann machine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5586469/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5586469/","accessionNumber":"11567719","conferenceDate":"18-23 July 2010","dateOfInsertion":"27 September 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-23 July 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An investigation on sampling technique for multi-objective restricted Boltzmann machine","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"C7304.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064212S","chronDate":"18-23 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5573635","isNumber":"5585910","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5573635","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5585910","articleId":"5586469","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":5586471,"authors":[{"name":"Ihsan M.

First, we describe the application of BPSO for model structure selection, by representing its particles' solutions as probabilities of change in a binary string. The binary string was then used to select a subset of regressor columns from the regressor matrix. The parameters (linear least squares solution) were then estimated using CGS, MGS, GT and GR. One-Step Ahead (OSA) and correlations tests performed on the DC motor dataset show that: 1) The BPSO-based selection method has the potential to become an effective method to determine parsimonious

Its simplicity and effectiveness justify the use of this technique in certain domains but it however presents several drawbacks referring to time response, noise sensitivity and storage requirements. Several solutions have been proposed in order to alleviate these problems, such as improving the technique for speeding up or carrying out a data reduction process. Prototype generation is a suitable process for data reduction that allows to fit a data set for nearest neighbor classification. Position adjustment of prototypes is a successful technique within the prototype generation methodology. Evolutionary algorithms are adaptive methods based on natural evolution that may be used for search and optimization. Position adjustment of prototypes can be viewed as a search problem, thus it could be solved using evolutionary algorithms. In this paper, we perform a preliminary study on the use of differential evolution algorithms to the prototype generation problem. Differential evolution models are compared with other algorithms for adjusting the position of prototypes and the results are contrasted through non-parametrical statistical tests. The results show that some differential evolution models consistently outperform previously proposed methods.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5586477/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-23 July 2010","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"18-23 July 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5586477/","dateOfInsertion":"27 September 2010","publicationDate":"July 2010","accessionNumber":"11567731","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A preliminary study on the use of differential evolution for adjusting the position of examples in nearest neighbor classification","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A preliminary study on the use of differential evolution for adjusting the position of examples in nearest neighbor classification","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"C7716.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.094511S","chronDate":"18-23 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5573635","isNumber":"5585910","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5573635","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5585910","articleId":"5586477","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5586491,"authors":[{"name":"Christian L.

This framework is based on Gaussian Adaptation (GaA), a search heuristic developed in the late 1960's. It is a maximum-entropy method that shares several features with the (1+1)-variant of the Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES). The algorithm samples single candidate solutions from a multivariate normal distribution and continuously adapts the first and second moments. We present modifications that turn the algorithm into both a robust continuous black-box optimizer and, alternatively, an adaptive Random Walk Monte Carlo sampler. In black-box optimization, sample-point selection is controlled by a monotonically decreasing, fitness-dependent acceptance threshold. We provide general strategy parameter settings, stopping criteria, and restart mechanisms that render GaA quasi parameter free. We also introduce Metropolis GaA (M-GaA), where sample-point selection is based on the Metropolis acceptance criterion. This turns GaA into a Monte Carlo sampler that is conceptually similar to the seminal Adaptive Proposal (AP) algorithm. We evaluate the performance of Restart GaA on the CEC 2005 benchmark suite. Moreover, we compare the efficacy of M-GaA to that of the Metropolis-Hastings and AP algorithms on selected target distributions.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5585910","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CEC.2010.5586491","publicationTitle":"IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","pdfPath":"/iel5/5573635/5585910/05586491.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","doi":"10.1109/CEC.2010.5586491","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Gaussian Adaptation as a unifying framework for continuous black-box optimization and adaptive Monte Carlo sampling","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-23 July 2010","displayDocTitle":"Gaussian Adaptation as a unifying framework for continuous black-box optimization and adaptive Monte Carlo sampling","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"18-23 July 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5586491/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2010","accessionNumber":"11567829","dateOfInsertion":"27 September 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5586491/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Gaussian Adaptation as a unifying framework for continuous black-box optimization and adaptive Monte Carlo sampling","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"C7726.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06562S","chronDate":"18-23 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5573635","isNumber":"5585910","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5573635","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5585910","articleId":"5586491","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5586493,"authors":[{"name":"Filipe M.

These results represent evidence for the adequacy of the proposed technique in solving the classes of multiobjective optimisation problems represented in the benchmark suites used.","doi":"10.1109/CEC.2010.5586512","publicationTitle":"IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","pdfPath":"/iel5/5573635/5585910/05586512.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5585910","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CEC.2010.5586512","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new self-adaptive approach for evolutionary multiobjective optimization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5586512/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-23 July 2010","displayDocTitle":"A new self-adaptive approach for evolutionary multiobjective optimization","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5586512/","dateOfInsertion":"27 September 2010","publicationDate":"July 2010","accessionNumber":"11567850","conferenceDate":"18-23 July 2010","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new self-adaptive approach for evolutionary multiobjective optimization","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"C7641.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.080338S","chronDate":"18-23 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5573635","isNumber":"5585910","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5573635","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5585910","articleId":"5586512","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5586515,"authors":[{"name":"Kenya Jin'no","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Nippon Institute of Technology, Minami-Saitama, Saitama, Japan"],"firstName":"Kenya","lastName":"Jin'no","id":"37569328300"},{"name":"Takuya Shindo","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Nippon Institute of Technology, Minami-Saitama, Saitama, Japan"],"firstName":"Takuya","lastName":"Shindo","id":"37719874300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6911-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6909-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6910-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-778X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0026"}],"articleNumber":"5586515","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":163},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","Particle swarm optimization","Damping","Trajectory","Numerical models","Acceleration","Convergence"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["deterministic algorithms","eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","particle swarm optimisation","search problems","stochastic processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["particle swarm optimization","global optimization problems","meta-heuristics algorithms","stochastic dynamics","eigenvalue","canonical deterministic PSO"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5586515","abstract":"A particle swarm optimization (PSO) system is one of the powerful systems for solving global optimization problems. The PSO algorithm can search an optimal value of a given evaluation function quickly compared with other proposed meta-heuristics algorithms. The conventional PSO system contains some random factors, therefore, the dynamics of the system can be regarded as stochastic dynamics. In order to analyze the dynamics rigorously, some papers pay attention to deterministic PSO systems which does not contain any stochastic factors. According to these results, the eigenvalues of the system impinge on the dynamics of the particles. Depending on the parameter, the searching ability of the deterministic PSO is decreased. Also, the eigenvalue is complex conjugate number, the system exhibits remarkable searching ability. In order to overcome this, we propose a canonical deterministic PSO which can control its eigenvalues easily, and can improve the searching ability. The dynamics of the system can characterize the damping factor and the rotation angle which can derive from its eigenvalue. We will confirm relation between these parameters and the searching ability of the optimal value from some numerical simulations.","doi":"10.1109/CEC.2010.5586515","pdfPath":"/iel5/5573635/5585910/05586515.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","publicationTitle":"IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CEC.2010.5586515","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5585910","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of dynamical characteristic of canonical deterministic PSO","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5586515/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-23 July 2010","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of dynamical characteristic of canonical deterministic PSO","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"27 September 2010","accessionNumber":"11567853","publicationDate":"July 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5586515/","conferenceDate":"18-23 July 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of dynamical characteristic of canonical deterministic PSO","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"C7644.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039497S","chronDate":"18-23 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5573635","isNumber":"5585910","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5573635","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"5585910","articleId":"5586515","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":5586516,"authors":[{"name":"Vladimir V.

The two major stages of the neural network ensemble construction are: design and training component networks, combining of the component networks predictions to produce the ensemble output. In this paper, a probability-based method is proposed to accomplish the first stage. Although this method is based on the genetic algorithm, it requires fewer parameters to be tuned. A method based on genetic programming is proposed for combining the predictions of component networks. This method allows us to build nonlinear combinations of component networks predictions providing more flexible and adaptive solutions.

We proposed the fitness approximation using a combination of the approximation model and the fuzzy clustering technique. There exist two advantages of the proposed method.

However, to the best of our knowledge, existing community detection methods based on Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) can detect separate communities only. This is because it is difficult to represent overlapping communities in ways that are suitable for EAs. In this paper, we first design a representation method that can represent each individual as both separated and overlapping communities without assigning the number of communities in advance. We then design three objective functions to guide the evolutionary process in different conditions. Finally, based on the designed representation and objective functions, we propose a multiobjective evolutionary algorithm to solve CDPs (MEA_CDPs) under the framework of NSGA-II. In the experiments, 4 well-known real-life benchmark networks are used to validate the performance of MEA_CDPs, and the results shown that MEA_CDPs not only can find high quality communities, but also can detect both separated and overlapping communities at the same time, and present multiple types of communities. Moreover, the overlapping nodes identified by MEA_CDPs are really ambiguous according to their edge distributes in different communities. This illustrates the effectiveness of the objective functions we designed.","doi":"10.1109/CEC.2010.5586522","publicationTitle":"IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","pdfPath":"/iel5/5573635/5585910/05586522.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CEC.2010.5586522","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5585910","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Separated and overlapping community detection in complex networks using multiobjective Evolutionary Algorithms","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5586522","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Separated and overlapping community detection in complex networks using multiobjective Evolutionary Algorithms","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-23 July 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5586522/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"18-23 July 2010","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2010","accessionNumber":"11567855","dateOfInsertion":"27 September 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5586522/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Separated and overlapping community detection in complex networks using multiobjective Evolutionary Algorithms","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"C7652.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.098637S","chronDate":"18-23 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5573635","isNumber":"5585910","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5573635","citationCount":"37","xplore-issue":"5585910","articleId":"5586522","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":5586530,"authors":[{"name":"Pablo Vidal","affiliation":["LabTEm Laboratorio de Tecnologias Emergentes, Unidad Academica Caleta Olivia, Universidad Nacional de La Patagonia Austral, Argentina"],"firstName":"Pablo","lastName":"Vidal","id":"38196328500"},{"name":"Enrique Alba","affiliation":["Department de Lenguajes y Ciencias de la Computacion, ETSI Informatica, University of Malaga, Malaga, Spain"],"firstName":"Enrique","lastName":"Alba","id":"37282630800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6911-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6909-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6910-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-778X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0026"}],"articleNumber":"5586530","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":18,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":539},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Graphics processing unit","Instruction sets","Kernel","Computer architecture","Optimization","Parallel processing","Hardware"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["coprocessors","genetic algorithms","parallel processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiGPU implementation","cellular genetic algorithm","NVIDIA CUDA technology","multiGPU cGA model","CPU","parallel computing"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5586530","abstract":"In this paper, we present a novel implementation of a Cellular Genetic Algorithm (cGA) model for a multi-GPU platform using NVIDIA's CUDA technology.

The modified Pareto-frontier Differential Evolution (PDE) algorithm is used to generate the Pareto optimal sets of ANN that optimize the conflicting objectives of maximizing the virtual E-puck robots' behaviors for pushing a box towards a wall based on RF-localization as well as minimizing the number of hidden neurons used in its feed-forward ANN controller. A new fitness function used during the collective robotics' optimization process is proposed. The experimentation results showed the virtual E-puck robots were capable of moving towards to the RF signal area. Thereafter, the robots were capable in self-assembling in the signal source area as well as completing the box-pushing towards the target wall with very small neural network architectures. Then, the genetic structures of the generated controllers have been further analyzed using the Hinton analysis. Hence, the results demonstrated that the utilization of the PDE approach in evolutionary robotics can be practically used to generate neural-based controllers for collective robotics' behaviors.","doi":"10.1109/CEC.2010.5586537","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","publicationTitle":"IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CEC.2010.5586537","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5585910","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","pdfPath":"/iel5/5573635/5585910/05586537.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Evolution and analysis of self-synthesized minimalist neural controllers for collective robotics using Pareto multi-objective optimization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5586537/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Evolution and analysis of self-synthesized minimalist neural controllers for collective robotics using Pareto multi-objective optimization","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5586537/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11567916","publicationDate":"July 2010","dateOfInsertion":"27 September 2010","conferenceDate":"18-23 July 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-23 July 2010","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Evolution and analysis of self-synthesized minimalist neural controllers for collective robotics using Pareto multi-objective optimization","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"C7671.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.087378S","chronDate":"18-23 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5573635","isNumber":"5585910","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5573635","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5585910","articleId":"5586537","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5586540,"authors":[{"name":"Mohand Mezmaz","affiliation":["Mathematics and Operational Research Department (MathRO), University of Mons, Belgium"],"firstName":"Mohand","lastName":"Mezmaz","id":"37427653500"},{"name":"Young Choon Lee","affiliation":["Centre of Distributed and High Performance Computing, University of Sydney, Australia"],"firstName":"Young Choon","lastName":"Lee","id":"37293402500"},{"name":"Nouredine Melab","affiliation":["National Institute of Research in Computer Science and Control (INRIA), University of Lille Nord de France, France"],"firstName":"Nouredine","lastName":"Melab","id":"37297112700"},{"name":"El-Ghazali Talbi","affiliation":["National Institute For Research In Computer Science and Control, University of Lille Nord de France, France"],"firstName":"El-Ghazali","lastName":"Talbi","id":"37276569800"},{"name":"Albert Y.

We propose a new bi-objective hybrid genetic algorithm that takes into account, not only makespan, but also energy consumption. This metaheuristic adopts dynamic voltage scaling (DVS) to minimize energy consumption. Our study provides promising results showing the significance and potential of DVS.

This is of particular interest with expensive fitness functions where the cost of building the model is outweighed by the saving of using fewer function evaluations. In this paper we show how a Markov network model can be used as a surrogate fitness function in a genetic algorithm. We demonstrate this applied to a number of well-known benchmark functions and although the results are good in terms of function evaluations the model-building overhead requires a substantially more expensive fitness function to be worthwhile. We move on to describe a fitness function for feature selection in Case-Based Reasoning, which is considerably more expensive than the other benchmark functions we used. We show that for this problem using the surrogate offers a significant decrease in total run time compared to a GA using the true fitness function.","doi":"10.1109/CEC.2010.5586548","pdfPath":"/iel5/5573635/5585910/05586548.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","publicationTitle":"IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CEC.2010.5586548","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5585910","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Using a Markov network as a surrogate fitness function in a genetic algorithm","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5586548/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-23 July 2010","displayDocTitle":"Using a Markov network as a surrogate fitness function in a genetic algorithm","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"27 September 2010","accessionNumber":"11567923","publicationDate":"July 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5586548/","conferenceDate":"18-23 July 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Using a Markov network as a surrogate fitness function in a genetic algorithm","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"C7686.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07048S","chronDate":"18-23 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5573635","isNumber":"5585910","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5573635","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"5585910","articleId":"5586548","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-06"},{"_id":5586570,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The influence of the position of the fingers on the handset was found to be more important when close to the antenna. The palm-handset gap and the index-finger location were the main factors for both absorption and mismatch loss. Different data-mode hand phantoms and configurations were investigated, showing that both \u201coverlapped\u201d and \u201cinterlaced\u201d grip styles similarly influenced the antenna's communication performance.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Antenna Proximity Effects for Talk and Data Modes in Mobile Phones","publicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Magazine","doi":"10.1109/MAP.2010.5586570","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel5/74/5586558/05586570.pdf","startPage":"15","endPage":"27","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MAP.2010.5586570","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5586558","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5586570","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5586570/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 September 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2010","displayDocTitle":"Antenna Proximity Effects for Talk and Data Modes in Mobile Phones","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"52","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/5586570/","dateOfInsertion":"27 September 2010","publicationDate":"June 2010","accessionNumber":"11556842","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Antenna Proximity Effects for Talk and Data Modes in Mobile Phones","sourcePdf":"0012.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.098714S","chronDate":"June  2010","xplore-pub-id":"74","isNumber":"5586558","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"74","citationCount":"53","xplore-issue":"5586558","articleId":"5586570","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-19"},{"_id":5586593,"authors":[{"name":"Danilo De Donno","affiliation":["University of Salerno, Lecce, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/74/5586558/5586593/5586593-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["David B.

What makes this class of remote control problems different from most of the previously studied models is the presence of noise in both the forward channel (connecting sensors to the controller) and the reverse channel (connecting the controller to the plant). For stability of the closed-loop system, we look for the existence of an invariant distribution for the state, for which we show that it is necessary that the entire control space and the state space be encoded, and that the reverse channel be at least as reliable as the forward channel. We obtain necessary conditions and sufficient conditions on the channels and the controllers for stabilizability. Using properties of the underlying sampled Markov chain, we show that under variable-length coding and some realistic channel conditions, stability can be achieved over discrete-alphabet channels even if the entire state and control spaces are to be encoded and the number of bits that can be transmitted per unit time is strictly bounded. For control over continuous-alphabet channels, however, a variable rate scheme is not necessary. We also show that memoryless policies are rate-efficient for Gaussian channels.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Control Over Noisy Forward and Reverse Channels","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","doi":"10.1109/TAC.2010.2081730","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/9/5765512/05586646.pdf","startPage":"1014","endPage":"1029","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAC.2010.2081730","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5765512","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5586646","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5586646/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 September 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2011","displayDocTitle":"Control Over Noisy Forward and Reverse Channels","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"56","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/5586646/","dateOfInsertion":"10 May 2011","publicationDate":"May 2011","accessionNumber":"11988363","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Control Over Noisy Forward and Reverse Channels","sourcePdf":"tac-yuksel-2081730-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.108013S","chronDate":"May  2011","xplore-pub-id":"9","isNumber":"5765512","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9","citationCount":"36","xplore-issue":"5765512","articleId":"5586646","onlineDate":"27 September 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5586648,"authors":[{"name":"Stanis\u0142aw J.

In this framework, we handle the design of kernels involving the Clifford or geometric product. In this approach, one redefines the optimization variables as multivectors. This allows us to have a multivector as output. Therefore, we can represent multiple classes according to the dimension of the geometric algebra in which we work. We show that one can apply CSVM for classification and regression and also to build a recurrent CSVM. The CSVM is an attractive approach for the multiple input multiple output processing of high-dimensional geometric entities. We carried out comparisons between CSVM and the current approaches to solve multiclass classification and regression. We also study the performance of the recurrent CSVM with experiments involving time series.

A new ordered-successive parallel interference cancellation (OSPIC) detector is proposed. This method consists of first carrying out coarse ordered interference cancellation detection, where the interference components are successively eliminated, and then performing fine interference cancellation detection using parallel interference reduction. Simulation results show that the proposed detector significantly outperforms existing detectors and performs close to that of CFO-free systems for practical signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). To further reduce the computational complexity, a minimum mean-square error (MMSE)-based reduced-complexity OSPIC (RC-OSPIC) detector is proposed. Compared with the MMSE detector, which requires a full-size complex matrix inversion, the proposed RC-OSPIC detector performs better and is computationally much more effective.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/5613993/05586663.pdf","startPage":"4614","endPage":"4620","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2010.2081695","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2010.2081695","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5613993","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5586663","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low-Complexity Data-Detection Algorithm in Cooperative SFBC-OFDM Systems With Multiple Frequency Offsets","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Detectors","OFDM","Cooperative systems","Signal to noise ratio","Interference cancellation","Algorithm design and analysis","Block codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["block codes","interference suppression","matrix inversion","mean square error methods","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data-detection algorithm","cooperative SFBC-OFDM systems","cooperative space-frequency block-coding","orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing","multiple carrier frequency offsets","ordered-successive parallel interference cancellation","coarse ordered interference cancellation","fine interference cancellation","computational complexity","minimum mean-square error","MMSE","matrix inversion","RC-OSPIC detector"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Carrier frequency offsets (CFOs)","cooperative systems","data detection","orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM)","space\u2013frequency block coding (SFBC)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5586663/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 September 2010","displayDocTitle":"Low-Complexity Data-Detection Algorithm in Cooperative SFBC-OFDM Systems With Multiple Frequency Offsets","volume":"59","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/5586663/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2010","accessionNumber":"11630038","dateOfInsertion":"09 November 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low-Complexity Data-Detection Algorithm in Cooperative SFBC-OFDM Systems With Multiple Frequency Offsets","sourcePdf":"tvt-huang-2081695-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.127169S","chronDate":"Nov.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"5613993","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"5613993","articleId":"5586663","onlineDate":"27 September 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5586726,"authors":[{"name":"Byung Cheol Song","affiliation":["Inha University, South Korea"],"firstName":"Byung Cheol","lastName":"Song","id":"37274662900"},{"name":"Shin-Cheol Jeong","affiliation":["Inha University, South Korea"],"firstName":"Shin-Cheol","lastName":"Jeong","id":"37535392200"},{"name":"Yanglim Choi","affiliation":["Samsung Electronics Company Limited, South Korea"],"firstName":"Yanglim","lastName":"Choi","id":"37595910100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7249-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7247-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-7248-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2154-512X"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2154-5111"},{"format":"CD","value":"2154-5111"}],"articleNumber":"5586726","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":283},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image edge detection","Spatial resolution","Gold"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image processing","image resolution","interpolation","motion compensation","motion estimation","video signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["key frame-based video super-resolution","bidirectional overlapped block motion compensation","dictionary","video super-resolution algorithm","low resolution video sequence","high resolution key pictures","hierarchical motion estimation","motion-compensated error","LR patch","artifacts blocking","interpolation algorithms"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Bi-directional overlapped block motion-compensation","super-resolution","key pictures","hierarchical motion estimation","dictionary","training"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents a video super-resolution algorithm to interpolate an arbitrary frame in a low resolution video sequence from sparsely existing high resolution key pictures. Firstly, hierarchical motion estimation is performed between the input and the key low resolution frames on a patch basis. If motion-compensated error is small, an input LR patch is super-resolved by bi-directional overlapped block motion compensation. Otherwise, the input patch is spatially super-resolved using the dictionary which is learned from the key low resolution and its corresponding high resolution pictures beforehand. Finally, possible blocking artifacts between a motion-compensated patch and a spatially super-resolved patch are concealed using a specific de-blocking process. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm provides significantly better subjective visual quality as well as objective quality than previous interpolation algorithms.","doi":"10.1109/IPTA.2010.5586726","publicationTitle":"2010 2nd International Conference on Image Processing Theory, Tools and Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 2nd International Conference on Image Processing Theory, Tools and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5579546/5586720/05586726.pdf","startPage":"181","endPage":"186","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IPTA.2010.5586726","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5586720","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Key frame-based video super-resolution using bi-directional overlapped block motion compensation and trained dictionary","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5586726","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 July 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5586726/","displayDocTitle":"Key frame-based video super-resolution using bi-directional overlapped block motion compensation and trained dictionary","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2010","accessionNumber":"11558883","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5586726/","conferenceDate":"7-10 July 2010","dateOfInsertion":"27 September 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Key frame-based video super-resolution using bi-directional overlapped block motion compensation and trained dictionary","confLoc":"Paris, France","sourcePdf":"p85.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049195S","chronDate":"7-10 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5579546","isNumber":"5586720","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5579546","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5586720","articleId":"5586726","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5586733,"authors":[{"name":"Hussain Al-Muscati","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, McGill University, Montreal, Canada"],"firstName":"Hussain","lastName":"Al-Muscati","id":"38356685500"},{"name":"Fabrice Labeau","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, McGill University, Montreal, Canada"],"firstName":"Fabrice","lastName":"Labeau","id":"37281330800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7249-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7247-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-7248-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2154-512X"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2154-5111"},{"format":"CD","value":"2154-5111"}],"articleNumber":"5586733","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":283},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Static VAr compensators","Automatic voltage control","Streaming media","Pixel","Transcoding","PSNR"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","image sequences","transcoding","video coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["temporal transcoding","video transcoder","pixel domain heterogeneous architecture","Macroblock coding modes","stream coded motion vectors","zero delay referencing structure","computational complexity","H.264/AVC video","video sequence","motion vectors"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Video Coding","Transcoding","Temporal","Heterogeneous","Refinement","Hierarchical"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5586733","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 2nd International Conference on Image Processing Theory, Tools and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5579546/5586720/05586733.pdf","startPage":"138","endPage":"143","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IPTA.2010.5586733","doi":"10.1109/IPTA.2010.5586733","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5586720","publicationTitle":"2010 2nd International Conference on Image Processing Theory, Tools and Applications","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Temporal transcoding of H.264/AVC video to the scalable format","abstract":"In this work, a novel implementation of a video transcoder that converts a video sequence encoded with the H.264/AVC standard to a temporally scalable H.264/SVC stream is achieved with the use of a pixel-domain heterogeneous architecture.

The developed program can be used in cell culture image processing for geographic information extraction and sensor sizing, generating cell count and Analog Hardware Description Language (AHDL) equivalent circuits useful for whole system electrical simulations.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 July 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5586770/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"11558926","publicationDate":"July 2010","conferenceDate":"7-10 July 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5586770/","dateOfInsertion":"27 September 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Automatic generation of Analog Hardware Description Language (AHDL) code from cell culture images","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automatic generation of Analog Hardware Description Language (AHDL) code from cell culture images","confLoc":"Paris, France","sourcePdf":"p173.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.108364S","chronDate":"7-10 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5579546","isNumber":"5586720","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5579546","xplore-issue":"5586720","articleId":"5586770","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5586798,"authors":[{"name":"Leila Makkaoui","affiliation":["Centre de Recherche en Automatique de Nancy (CRAN), Nancy-Universit\u00e9, CNRS, Vandoeuvre-les-Nancy, France"],"firstName":"Leila","lastName":"Makkaoui","id":"38193011400"},{"name":"Vincent Lecuire","affiliation":["Centre de Recherche en Automatique de Nancy (CRAN), Nancy-Universit\u00e9, CNRS, Vandoeuvre-les-Nancy, France"],"firstName":"Vincent","lastName":"Lecuire","id":"37324596900"},{"name":"Jean-Marie Moureaux","affiliation":["Centre de Recherche en Automatique de Nancy (CRAN), Nancy-Universit\u00e9, CNRS, Vandoeuvre-les-Nancy, France"],"firstName":"Jean-Marie","lastName":"Moureaux","id":"37282596100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7249-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7247-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-7248-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2154-512X"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2154-5111"},{"format":"CD","value":"2154-5111"}],"articleNumber":"5586798","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":30,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":356},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Discrete cosine transforms","Image coding","Energy consumption","Transform coding","Wireless sensor networks","Shape","PSNR"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cameras","data compression","discrete cosine transforms","energy consumption","image coding","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wireless camera sensor networks","image compression","fast zonal discrete cosine transform","energy consumption","network lifetime","power greedy components","JPEG2000","image distortion"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Image compression","Discrete Cosine Transform","Zonal coding","Wireless sensor networks","Energy conservation"]}],"abstract":"This paper deals with image compression over Wireless Camera Sensor Networks (WCSNs) in order to decrease the energy consumption of sensors and thus to maintain a long network lifetime. As the radio tranceiver is the most power greedy components of sensor nodes, it seems natural to consider lossy compression before transmission as the appropriate answer to the problem of energy consumption. However, the limitation of sensor nodes in terms of memory as well as processor speed makes most of the compression algorithms inapplicable. Indeed, the most popular methods such as JPEG or JPEG2000 can yield a higher energy consumption than when transmitting uncompressed images. Here we propose to solve this problem by the design of a fast zonal DCT-based image compression algorithm which allows an efficient tuning of the trade-off between energy consumption and image distortion, as shown by experimental results provided in the paper.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fast zonal DCT-based image compression for Wireless Camera Sensor Networks","publicationTitle":"2010 2nd International Conference on Image Processing Theory, Tools and Applications","doi":"10.1109/IPTA.2010.5586798","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 2nd International Conference on Image Processing Theory, Tools and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5579546/5586720/05586798.pdf","startPage":"126","endPage":"129","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IPTA.2010.5586798","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5586720","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5586798","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5586798/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 July 2010","displayDocTitle":"Fast zonal DCT-based image compression for Wireless Camera Sensor Networks","conferenceDate":"7-10 July 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5586798/","dateOfInsertion":"27 September 2010","publicationDate":"July 2010","accessionNumber":"11558953","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast zonal DCT-based image compression for Wireless Camera Sensor Networks","confLoc":"Paris, France","sourcePdf":"p124.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051319S","chronDate":"7-10 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5579546","isNumber":"5586720","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5579546","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"5586720","articleId":"5586798","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5586804,"authors":[{"name":"Dalton Rosario","affiliation":["U.S. Army Research Laboratory, USA"],"firstName":"Dalton","lastName":"Rosario","id":"37281988900"},{"name":"Joao Romano","affiliation":["U.

Scene anomaly detection has a wide range of use in remote sensing applications requiring no specific material signatures. The approach uses a repeated multisampling scheme to characterize the unknown clutter background and the most popular anomaly detection algorithm - the Reed-Xiaoli algorithm - for scoring. The approach requires only a small fraction of the data cube to characterize clutter, it does not perform segmentation, and it is invariant to objects' scales (i.e., relative spatial sizes of objects in the imagery). Results using real multivariate spectral data are promising for autonomous manmade object detection tasks under different atmospheric conditions.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multidimensional image processing for remote sensing anomaly detection","publicationTitle":"2010 2nd International Conference on Image Processing Theory, Tools and Applications","doi":"10.1109/IPTA.2010.5586804","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 2nd International Conference on Image Processing Theory, Tools and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5579546/5586720/05586804.pdf","startPage":"471","endPage":"476","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IPTA.2010.5586804","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5586720","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5586804","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5586804/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 July 2010","displayDocTitle":"Multidimensional image processing for remote sensing anomaly detection","conferenceDate":"7-10 July 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5586804/","dateOfInsertion":"27 September 2010","publicationDate":"July 2010","accessionNumber":"11558959","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multidimensional image processing for remote sensing anomaly detection","confLoc":"Paris, France","sourcePdf":"p115.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065287S","chronDate":"7-10 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5579546","isNumber":"5586720","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5579546","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5586720","articleId":"5586804","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5586856,"authors":[{"name":"Stefano Rosati","affiliation":["DEIS/ARCES \u2013 University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy"],"firstName":"Stefano","lastName":"Rosati","id":"37399597300"},{"name":"Enzo Alberto Candreva","affiliation":["DEIS/ARCES \u2013 University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy"],"firstName":"Enzo Alberto","lastName":"Candreva","id":"38193032100"},{"name":"Giovanni E.

The proposed technique, named Rotation Invariant Subcarrier Mapping (RISM), is a novel scheme for subcarriers data mapping, where the symbols belonging to the modulation alphabet are not anchored, but maintain degrees of freedom. In other words, a bit tuple is not mapped on a single point, rather it is mapped onto a geometrical locus, which is totally or partially rotation invariant. The final positions of the transmitted complex symbols are chosen by an iterative optimization process to minimize the PAPR of the resulting OFDM symbol. Numerical results confirm that RISM makes OFDM usable even in severe non-linear channels.","doi":"10.1109/ASMS-SPSC.2010.5586856","publicationTitle":"2010 5th Advanced Satellite Multimedia Systems Conference and the 11th Signal Processing for Space Communications Workshop","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 5th Advanced Satellite Multimedia Systems Conference and the 11th Signal Processing for Space Communications Workshop","pdfPath":"/iel5/5576746/5586844/05586856.pdf","startPage":"436","endPage":"443","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASMS-SPSC.2010.5586856","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5586844","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Rotation Invariant Subcarrier Mapping: A novel technique enabling quasi-constant OFDM envelope","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5586856","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 Sept. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5586856/","displayDocTitle":"Rotation Invariant Subcarrier Mapping: A novel technique enabling quasi-constant OFDM envelope","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11558808","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5586856/","conferenceDate":"13-15 Sept. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"27 September 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Rotation Invariant Subcarrier Mapping: A novel technique enabling quasi-constant OFDM envelope","confLoc":"Cagliari, Italy","sourcePdf":"1569321743.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.0829S","chronDate":"13-15 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5576746","isNumber":"5586844","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5576746","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5586844","articleId":"5586856","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5586868,"authors":[{"name":"Harald Skinnemoen","affiliation":["Founder and Chairman AnsuR Technologies and AV SatCom AS, Oslo, Norway"],"firstName":"Harald","lastName":"Skinnemoen","id":"37346742000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6833-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6831-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6832-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2329-7093"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2326-5949"}],"articleNumber":"5586868","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":271},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Digital video broadcasting","Satellites","Modulation","IP networks","Next generation networking","Encoding","Satellite broadcasting"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital video broadcasting","satellite communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DVB-RCS satellite communication systems","satellite community","digital video broadcasting"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["DVB-RCS","standard","applications","maritime","utility"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents current status, progress and next steps of the largest standardization effort conducted for satellite communication systems.

The MIMO LOS channel is optimized with respect to the maximum achievable spectral efficiency. The aim of our approach is to keep this optimum spectral efficiency nearly constantly even if the terminal on earth is moving. We provide an analytical derivation for the optimum UCA arrangement and prove our results by numerical simulations. Especially for mobile applications, the UCA antenna arrangement seems to be a reasonable candidate in order to guarantee high capacity performance durably. To this end, we present a very simple triangle shaped antenna arrangement which is compact enough to allow vehicle roof top installations for S-band applications.","doi":"10.1109/ASMS-SPSC.2010.5586873","publicationTitle":"2010 5th Advanced Satellite Multimedia Systems Conference and the 11th Signal Processing for Space Communications Workshop","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 5th Advanced Satellite Multimedia Systems Conference and the 11th Signal Processing for Space Communications Workshop","pdfPath":"/iel5/5576746/5586844/05586873.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASMS-SPSC.2010.5586873","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5586844","startPage":"421","endPage":"428","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Uniform circular arrays: The key to optimum channel capacity in mobile MIMO satellite links","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5586873","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Uniform circular arrays: The key to optimum channel capacity in mobile MIMO satellite links","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 Sept. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5586873/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"13-15 Sept. 2010","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11558824","dateOfInsertion":"27 September 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5586873/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Uniform circular arrays: The key to optimum channel capacity in mobile MIMO satellite links","confLoc":"Cagliari, Italy","sourcePdf":"1569302509.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066077S","chronDate":"13-15 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5576746","isNumber":"5586844","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5576746","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5586844","articleId":"5586873","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5586879,"authors":[{"name":"Mo Zhu","affiliation":["Centre for Communication Systems Research, University of Surrey, Guildford, Surrey, UK"],"firstName":"Mo","lastName":"Zhu","id":"38006759400"},{"name":"Adegbenga B.

The main motivation comes from the need of efficiently mitigating multipath and interference sources in order to achieve centimetre accuracy. One of the critical aspects appearing when an array of antennas is implemented resides on the array perturbations and mismodelling. For that reason, this work places special emphasis on this issue and some robust beamforming techniques are proposed. Differently from other studies addressing the use of conventional beamforming techniques for navigation applications, we propose novel strategies specially adapted to the considered scenario. As shown in the paper, the use of digital beamforming allows for a (at least) 47% reduction in terms of tracking errors when compared to a single antenna receiver.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 Sept. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5586884/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"11558835","publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","conferenceDate":"13-15 Sept. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5586884/","dateOfInsertion":"27 September 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A novel look into digital beamforming techniques for multipath and interference mitigation in Galileo Ground Stations","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel look into digital beamforming techniques for multipath and interference mitigation in Galileo Ground Stations","confLoc":"Cagliari, Italy","sourcePdf":"1569301273.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060963S","chronDate":"13-15 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5576746","isNumber":"5586844","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5576746","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5586844","articleId":"5586884","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":5586885,"authors":[{"name":"Sarang Thombre","affiliation":["Department of Computer Systems, Tampere University of Technology, Tempere, Finland"],"firstName":"Sarang","lastName":"Thombre","id":"37704696000"},{"name":"Heikki Hurskainen","affiliation":["Department of Computer Systems, Tampere University of Technology, Tempere, Finland"],"firstName":"Heikki","lastName":"Hurskainen","id":"37295348700"},{"name":"Jari Nurmi","affiliation":["Department of Computer Systems, Tampere University of Technology, Tempere, Finland"],"firstName":"Jari","lastName":"Nurmi","id":"37274976400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6833-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6831-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6832-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2329-7093"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2326-5949"}],"articleNumber":"5586885","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":622},"abstract":"This paper presents the design methodology, simulation results and implementation details of a low noise amplifier (LNA) designed to operate over the whole range of Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) frequencies (1164 MHz to 1615.5 MHz). This LNA works over combined (but overlapping) frequency bands of all three GNSS constellations (GNSS consist of the American Global Positioning System (GPS), European Galileo system and the Russian GLONASS system). Designed to be unconditionally stable with gain of over 18 dB and noise figure of 2 dB over a considerable bandwidth of about 450 MHz, the achieved results conformed quite well to the specifications. Final implementation results include a gain of 18.5 dB at the centre frequency with a nominal variation of \u00b11.3 dB over the desired bandwidth. The noise figure obtained is 2.18 dB and the amplifier stability range extends from 0 Hz to 9 GHz. Very high degree of linearity is achieved with output ldB compression at +13 dBm and output third order intercept at +23 dBm. This paper describes results at every stage of design, simulation and implementation along with a solution against typical low frequency instability by a small trade-off in noise

The channel is assumed to be Line-Of-Sight where link is a single physical path with complex gain and a large fixed delay (e.g. GEO satellite). SIA achieves interference-free degree of freedom in cellular networks owing to the rich scattering present in the terrestrial channel. In this paper, we show that it is also possible to achieve interference-free degree of freedom in the multibeam satellite system. We propose the geometrical arrangement constraints for both, the beam and the satellite, for full per-station interference-free transmission using finite dimensions. The theoretical potential is shown to be very large compared to the current schemes, which are based on orthogonalization and reuse. However, our results show the necessity of large bandwidth scaling with increase in number of stations. Moreover, we analyze the required scaling in a realistic scenario, which turns out to be unfeasible. Consequently, SIA is theoretically advantageous for a LOS satellite multibeam but practical schemes exploiting alignment in other domains should be developed.","doi":"10.1109/ASMS-SPSC.2010.5586887","publicationTitle":"2010 5th Advanced Satellite Multimedia Systems Conference and the 11th Signal Processing for Space Communications Workshop","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 5th Advanced Satellite Multimedia Systems Conference and the 11th Signal Processing for Space Communications Workshop","pdfPath":"/iel5/5576746/5586844/05586887.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASMS-SPSC.2010.5586887","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5586844","startPage":"234","endPage":"239","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Subspace Interference Alignment for multibeam satellite communications systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5586887","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Subspace Interference Alignment for multibeam satellite communications systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 Sept. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5586887/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"13-15 Sept. 2010","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11558838","dateOfInsertion":"27 September 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5586887/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Subspace Interference Alignment for multibeam satellite communications systems","confLoc":"Cagliari, Italy","sourcePdf":"1569299987.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.108504S","chronDate":"13-15 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5576746","isNumber":"5586844","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5576746","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5586844","articleId":"5586887","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5586892,"authors":[{"name":"Markus Flohberger","affiliation":["Institute of Communication Networks and Satellite Communications, Graz University of Technology, Austria"],"firstName":"Markus","lastName":"Flohberger","id":"37643861100"},{"name":"Wilfried Gappmair","affiliation":["Institute of Communication Networks and Satellite Communications, Graz University of Technology, Austria"],"firstName":"Wilfried","lastName":"Gappmair","id":"37282870600"},{"name":"Otto Koudelka","affiliation":["Institute of Communication Networks and Satellite Communications, Graz University of Technology, Austria"],"firstName":"Otto","lastName":"Koudelka","id":"37297462900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6833-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6831-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6832-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2329-7093"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2326-5949"}],"articleNumber":"5586892","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":639},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Signal to noise ratio","Digital video broadcasting","Phase shift keying","Frequency modulation","Estimation","Satellite communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["modulation","satellite communication","signal classification"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["modulation classifier","satellite communications","intelligent receivers","modulation schemes","APSK signal classification","DVB-S2 standard","feature-based method"]}],"abstract":"For the design of intelligent receivers, the classification of modulation schemes becomes an increasingly important task.

The problem of having more than one BS in the same PN code acquisition system makes it necessary to discriminate between correct detection and false alarm events. Since IS-95 uses the same PN sequence for all BSs, but with different code offsets, it is possible to use a cross-correlation technique to estimate both code and frequency offsets of several BSs at once. Time-Difference-Of-Arrival (TDOA) technique is used by the Mobile Station (MS) to geolocate itself. The positioning estimate is found to be stable in time and with a precision compatible with that required by emergency services, such as Enhanced 911 (E911).","doi":"10.1109/ASMS-SPSC.2010.5586895","publicationTitle":"2010 5th Advanced Satellite Multimedia Systems Conference and the 11th Signal Processing for Space Communications Workshop","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 5th Advanced Satellite Multimedia Systems Conference and the 11th Signal Processing for Space Communications Workshop","pdfPath":"/iel5/5576746/5586844/05586895.pdf","startPage":"343","endPage":"348","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASMS-SPSC.2010.5586895","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5586844","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Parallel PN code acquisition for wireless positioning in CDMA handsets","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5586895","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 Sept. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5586895/","displayDocTitle":"Parallel PN code acquisition for wireless positioning in CDMA handsets","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11558846","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5586895/","conferenceDate":"13-15 Sept. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"27 September 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Parallel PN code acquisition for wireless positioning in CDMA handsets","confLoc":"Cagliari, Italy","sourcePdf":"1569298678.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045852S","chronDate":"13-15 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5576746","isNumber":"5586844","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5576746","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5586844","articleId":"5586895","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":5586898,"authors":[{"name":"Antonio Angioi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Cagliari, Cagliari, Italy"],"firstName":"Antonio","lastName":"Angioi","id":"38192992800"},{"name":"Marco Lixia","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Cagliari, Cagliari, Italy"],"firstName":"Marco","lastName":"Lixia","id":"37540762100"},{"name":"Maurizio Murroni","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Cagliari, Cagliari, Italy"],"firstName":"Maurizio","lastName":"Murroni","id":"37323987300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6833-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6831-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6832-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2329-7093"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2326-5949"}],"articleNumber":"5586898","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":384},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["PSNR","Optimization","Modulation","Satellites","Biological cells","Satellite broadcasting"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","phase shift keying","satellite communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimized APSK bit allocation","satellite communication","optimal bit allocation","APSK modulation","genetic algorithm","satellite channel error sensitivity"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Amplitude Phase-Shift Keying Modulation","Modulation with Unequal Power Allocation","Genetic Algorithms"]}],"abstract":"In this paper a novel optimal bit allocation for APSK modulation is proposed.

For each topic, commonalities and differences between DTN and Performance Enhancing Proxies (PEPs) are highlighted, to show that the DTN architecture can be seen as a promising evolution of PEPs, at present the most widely adopted architecture. The analysis shows that DTN can effectively improve PEPs functionalities in the presence of intermittent and disruptive channels and/or a high level of network heterogeneity. In particular, DTN offers the possibility to operate with intermittent channels, a better resilience to channel disruptions, the possibility to implement both end-to-end and hop-by-hop security, and a greater flexibility in the use of advanced QoS techniques.","doi":"10.1109/ASMS-SPSC.2010.5586899","publicationTitle":"2010 5th Advanced Satellite Multimedia Systems Conference and the 11th Signal Processing for Space Communications Workshop","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 5th Advanced Satellite Multimedia Systems Conference and the 11th Signal Processing for Space Communications Workshop","pdfPath":"/iel5/5576746/5586844/05586899.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASMS-SPSC.2010.5586899","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5586844","startPage":"62","endPage":"67","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Satellite communications: From PEPs to DTN","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5586899","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Satellite communications: From PEPs to DTN","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 Sept. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5586899/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"13-15 Sept. 2010","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11558850","dateOfInsertion":"27 September 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5586899/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Satellite communications: From PEPs to DTN","confLoc":"Cagliari, Italy","sourcePdf":"1569298242.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06328S","chronDate":"13-15 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5576746","isNumber":"5586844","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5576746","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5586844","articleId":"5586899","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5586901,"authors":[{"name":"Ilaria Thibault","affiliation":["DEIS/ARCES, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy"],"firstName":"Ilaria","lastName":"Thibault","id":"37945231400"},{"name":"Giovanni E.

These satellites typically employ uniform allocation of RF power and bandwidth to spot beams. Since the traffic distribution tends to be highly asymmetrical and with a high degree of uncertainty, the satellite does not have sufficient flexibility to satisfy the traffic request on a beam per beam basis in an efficient manner. This paper investigates two new candidate multibeam system transmission schemes, namely, the Flexible and Beam-Hoping (BH) scheme, focusing on the forward link. We formulate the system-level optimization and propose an iterative algorithm that always converges given the constraints posed by the payload. The algorithm feeds a detailed system-level simulator which takes into account Ka-band channel and physical layer statistics. Our results show that both candidates outperform the conventional system in terms of both adaptation throughput matching to traffic demands and a more efficient use of available resources.

A comparison with other coding strategies shows that this code is an attractive option for use in a return satellite link application using adaptive coding and modulation.","publicationTitle":"2010 5th Advanced Satellite Multimedia Systems Conference and the 11th Signal Processing for Space Communications Workshop","startPage":"98","endPage":"105","doi":"10.1109/ASMS-SPSC.2010.5586916","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASMS-SPSC.2010.5586916","pdfPath":"/iel5/5576746/5586844/05586916.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 5th Advanced Satellite Multimedia Systems Conference and the 11th Signal Processing for Space Communications Workshop","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5586844","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive coding and modulation for return satellite links using binary turbo coding","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5586916/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 Sept. 2010","conferenceDate":"13-15 Sept. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive coding and modulation for return satellite links using binary turbo coding","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"27 September 2010","publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11558867","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5586916/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive coding and modulation for return satellite links using binary turbo coding","confLoc":"Cagliari, Italy","sourcePdf":"1569295897.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064992S","chronDate":"13-15 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5576746","isNumber":"5586844","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5576746","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5586844","articleId":"5586916","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5586919,"authors":[{"name":"Michael Bergmann","affiliation":["Institute of Communication Networks and Satellite Communications, Graz University of Technology, Austria"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Bergmann","id":"38341464100"},{"name":"Wilfried Gappmair","affiliation":["Institute of Communication Networks and Satellite Communications, Graz University of Technology, Austria"],"firstName":"Wilfried","lastName":"Gappmair","id":"37282870600"},{"name":"Harald Schlemmer","affiliation":["Joanneum Research, Institute of Applied Systems Technology, Austria"],"firstName":"Harald","lastName":"Schlemmer","id":"37946203600"},{"name":"Otto Koudelka","affiliation":["Institute of Communication Networks and Satellite Communications, Graz University of Technology, Austria","Joanneum Research, Institute of Applied Systems Technology, Austria"],"firstName":"Otto","lastName":"Koudelka","id":"37297462900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6833-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6831-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6832-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2329-7093"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2326-5949"}],"articleNumber":"5586919","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":137},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Signal to noise ratio","Estimation","Joints","Jitter","Receivers","Binary phase shift keying"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["codes","parameter estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code-aware joint estimation","carrier phase","linear modulation schemes","training sequence","data-aided parameter estimation","non-data-aided solutions","payload symbols","Cramer-Rao lower bound","SNR estimation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Code-aware estimation","Cramer-Rao lower bound","carrier phase","signal-to-noise ratio"]}],"abstract":"Depending on the length of the training sequence, data-aided parameter estimation requires some extra bandwidth. On the other hand, with non-data-aided solutions the payload symbols can be exploited as well, although the performance deviates significantly from the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) in the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime. In order to bridge this gap, recent activities concentrated more and more on code-aware (CA) algorithms so as to use the potential of error correction schemes, which usually form part of modern communication systems. In this context, methods for both carrier phase and SNR estimation have been published in the open literature. In the current paper, we extend this work by developing a CA algorithm for joint estimation of carrier phase and SNR; for comparison purposes, the CRLB of this joint approach is derived as the theoretical performance limit.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Code-aware joint estimation of carrier phase and SNR for linear modulation schemes","publicationTitle":"2010 5th Advanced Satellite Multimedia Systems Conference and the 11th Signal Processing for Space Communications Workshop","doi":"10.1109/ASMS-SPSC.2010.5586919","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 5th Advanced Satellite Multimedia Systems Conference and the 11th Signal Processing for Space Communications Workshop","pdfPath":"/iel5/5576746/5586844/05586919.pdf","startPage":"177","endPage":"182","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASMS-SPSC.2010.5586919","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5586844","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5586919","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5586919/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 Sept. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Code-aware joint estimation of carrier phase and SNR for linear modulation schemes","conferenceDate":"13-15 Sept. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5586919/","dateOfInsertion":"27 September 2010","publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11558870","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Code-aware joint estimation of carrier phase and SNR for linear modulation schemes","confLoc":"Cagliari, Italy","sourcePdf":"1569293847.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.088227S","chronDate":"13-15 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5576746","isNumber":"5586844","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5576746","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5586844","articleId":"5586919","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5586925,"authors":[{"name":"Vincent Deslandes","affiliation":["System Telecom Department, EADS Astrium GmbH, France"],"firstName":"Vincent","lastName":"Deslandes","id":"38193006700"},{"name":"J\u00e9r\u00f4me Tronc","affiliation":["System Telecom Department, EADS Astrium GmbH, France"],"firstName":"J\u00e9r\u00f4me","lastName":"Tronc","id":"38193006200"},{"name":"Andr\u00e9-Luc Beylot","affiliation":["IRIT Laboratory, Universit\u00e9 de Toulouse, France"],"firstName":"Andr\u00e9-Luc","lastName":"Beylot","id":"37294719000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6833-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6831-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6832-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2329-7093"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2326-5949"}],"articleNumber":"5586925","dbTime":"17 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":29,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1536},"abstract":"The recent emergence of satellite and terrestrial integrated mobile systems raises new challenges for interference coordination between satellite and terrestrial users. The terrestrial component aims at improving the satellite coverage in highly populated areas where satellite communications often suffer from a high blocking factor caused by the buildings. The term \u201cintegrated system\u201d refers to a system composed of a multi-beam Satellite Based Network (SBN) and a Complementary Ground Component (CGC) network that re-uses the same frequency band than the satellite's one. This principle is of major interest to improve the spectral efficiency of the overall system and spatially optimize the usage of scarce spectrum resource available at low frequency bands such as L or S-band. Satellite and CGCs are assumed to be controlled by the same resource management entity which allows the coordination of frequency allocation between both components. The understanding of mutual interferences between both components is a key element for the design of such a system taking into account the forecasted balance between the number of terrestrial and satellite users in the system. This paper presents a model of an integrated mobile network composed of a multi-beam satellite, terrestrial base stations and hybrid satellite/terrestrial user terminals. This model is then used for statistical simulations of a continental scale network over Europe in order to analyze interferences between satellite and terrestrial users. The influence of several parameters such as the satellite frequency reuse pattern and the exclusion zone size between terrestrial and satellite cells is then presented.","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 5th Advanced Satellite Multimedia Systems Conference and the 11th Signal Processing for Space Communications Workshop","pdfPath":"/iel5/5576746/5586844/05586925.pdf","startPage":"256","endPage":"261","publicationTitle":"2010 5th Advanced Satellite Multimedia Systems Conference and the 11th Signal Processing for Space Communications Workshop","doi":"10.1109/ASMS-SPSC.2010.5586925","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASMS-SPSC.2010.5586925","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5586844","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5586925","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of interference issues in Integrated Satellite and Terrestrial Mobile Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Satellites","Satellite broadcasting","Interference","Mobile communication","Satellite antennas","Europe","Gain"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mobile satellite communication","radiofrequency interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["interference issues","integrated satellite systems","terrestrial mobile systems","multibeam satellite based network","complementary ground component network","terrestrial base stations","hybrid satellite-terrestrial user terminals","satellite frequency reuse pattern","exclusion zone size","terrestrial cells","satellite cells"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Integrated Satellite-Terrestrial Systrem","MSS","CGC","ATC","Interference"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5586925/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 Sept. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of interference issues in Integrated Satellite and Terrestrial Mobile Systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5586925/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11558876","dateOfInsertion":"27 September 2010","conferenceDate":"13-15 Sept. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of interference issues in Integrated Satellite and Terrestrial Mobile Systems","confLoc":"Cagliari, Italy","sourcePdf":"1569274177.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.11488S","chronDate":"13-15 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5576746","isNumber":"5586844","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5576746","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"5586844","articleId":"5586925","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5586955,"authors":[{"name":"Naouel Ayari","affiliation":["LIP2 Laboratory, Tunis, Tunisie"],"firstName":"Naouel","lastName":"Ayari","id":"38196199900"},{"name":"Th\u00e9 Van Luong","affiliation":["INRIA Lille Nord Europe, Villeneuve d'Ascq, France"],"firstName":"Th\u00e9 Van","lastName":"Luong","id":"37085915270"},{"name":"Abderrazak Jemai","affiliation":["INSAT and LIP2 Laboratory, Tunis, Tunisie"],"firstName":"Abderrazak","lastName":"Jemai","id":"38579340900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7717-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7716-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-7715-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-5322"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-5330"}],"articleNumber":"5586955","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":13,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":123},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Encoding","Search problems","Electronic mail","Algorithm design and analysis","Evolutionary computation","Laboratories"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","graph theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hybrid genetic algorithm","Golomb ruler problem","optimal rulers","exact methods","constraint programming","local searches","evolutionary algorithms","near-optimal Golomb rulers"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Golomb rulers","Combinatorial problem","Tabu Search","Genetic Algorithm","Hybrid model"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5586955","abstract":"In recent years, with the massive use of Golomb rulers in various fields of engineering, new optimal rulers have become an important subject of search.

Therefore, this paper provides a genetic algorithm based on task clustering techniques for scheduling parallel applications with large communication delays on distributed memory parallel systems. The genetic algorithm is improved with the introduction of some extra knowledge about the scheduling problem. This knowledge is represented by a class of clustering heuristic which is based on structural properties of the parallel application. The major feature of the proposed algorithm is that it takes advantage of the effectiveness of task clustering for reducing communication delays combined with the ability of the genetic algorithms for exploring and exploiting information of the search space of the scheduling problem. The algorithm is assessed by simulation run on some families of traced graphs which represents some of the numerical parallel application programs, and a set of randomly generated applications. Simulation results showed that this algorithm significantly improves the performance of related approaches.","doi":"10.1109/AICCSA.2010.5587030","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","publicationTitle":"ACS/IEEE International Conference on Computer Systems and Applications - AICCSA 2010","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AICCSA.2010.5587030","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5586930","displayPublicationTitle":"ACS/IEEE International Conference on Computer Systems and Applications - AICCSA 2010","pdfPath":"/iel5/5570122/5586930/05587030.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An improved genetic algorithm for efficient scheduling on distributed memory parallel systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5587030/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"An improved genetic algorithm for efficient scheduling on distributed memory parallel systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5587030/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11558592","publicationDate":"May 2010","dateOfInsertion":"27 September 2010","conferenceDate":"16-19 May 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-19 May 2010","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An improved genetic algorithm for efficient scheduling on distributed memory parallel systems","confLoc":"Hammamet, Tunisia","sourcePdf":"paper142.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070809S","chronDate":"16-19 May 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5570122","isNumber":"5586930","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5570122","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5586930","articleId":"5587030","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":5587099,"authors":[{"name":"Simone Bellisai","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Elettronica ed Informazione, Politecnico di Milano, Milan, Italy"],"firstName":"Simone","lastName":"Bellisai","id":"37706251700"},{"name":"Fabrizio Guerrieri","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Elettronica ed Informazione, Politecnico di Milano, Milan, Italy"],"firstName":"Fabrizio","lastName":"Guerrieri","id":"37543266600"},{"name":"Simone Tisa","affiliation":["Micro Photon Devices S. r. l., Bolzano, Italy"],"firstName":"Simone","lastName":"Tisa","id":"37268174200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-3-9813-7540-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7905-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-3-9813754-1-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5587099","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":307},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5587099","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Pixel","Three dimensional displays","Photonics","Arrays","Logic gates","Distance measurement","Radiation detectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["avalanche diodes","CMOS image sensors","fluorescence spectroscopy","sensor arrays","smart pixels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3D ranging","high speed imaging array","3D image acquisition","CMOS SPAD sensor","bidimensional imaging","smart pixel array","single photon avalanche diodes"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["component","3D","SPAD","TOF"]}],"publicationTitle":"6th Conference on Ph.D. Research in Microelectronics & Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"6th Conference on Ph.D. Research in Microelectronics & Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/5579765/5587092/05587099.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5587092","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"3D ranging with a high speed imaging array","abstract":"We present an innovative system for 3D image acquisition using a general purpose CMOS SPAD sensor for bidimensional imaging developed in our laboratory.

The feasibility of SCU P&V partial-RESET programming is experimentally demonstrated for the case of 4 log-spaced levels within the available resistance window.","publicationTitle":"6th Conference on Ph.D. Research in Microelectronics & Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"6th Conference on Ph.D. Research in Microelectronics & Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/5579765/5587092/05587170.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5587092","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Feasibility study of partial-RESET multilevel programming in Phase Change Memories","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Feasibility study of partial-RESET multilevel programming in Phase Change Memories","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5587170/","conferenceDate":"18-21 July 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5587170/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"27 September 2010","publicationDate":"July 2010","accessionNumber":"11559047","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 July 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Feasibility study of partial-RESET multilevel programming in Phase Change Memories","confLoc":"Berlin, Germany","sourcePdf":"10037.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.252485S","chronDate":"18-21 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5579765","isNumber":"5587092","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5579765","xplore-issue":"5587092","articleId":"5587170","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"VDE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5587173,"authors":[{"name":"Rana Mahdi","affiliation":["Department of Optical Sensor Systems, Fraunhofer Institute for Microelectronic Circuits and System (IMS), Duisburg, Germany"],"firstName":"Rana","lastName":"Mahdi","id":"38196426400"},{"name":"Johannes Fink","affiliation":["Department of Optical Sensor Systems, Fraunhofer Institute for Microelectronic Circuits and System (IMS), Duisburg, Germany"],"firstName":"Johannes","lastName":"Fink","id":"38192611300"},{"name":"Bedrich J.

The key feature of the so-called Lateral Drift-Field Photodetector (LDPD) is a lateral electric drift field inside the photoactive area of the device. This results in a significant acceleration of the charge collection compared to conventional diffusion based detectors and, therefore, this device is an ideal candidate for high speed applications like 3D Time-of-Flight imaging. Furthermore, the LDPD concept shows a superior noise performance as the charge collection node is decoupled from the readout node.

Power control through weighted least square (WLS) approach provides protection to PUs from the harmful interference induced by SUs but fails to support all the SUs with SINRs above minimum required value. To overcome this drawback, we propose an iteratively reweighted least squares (IRLS) based power control algorithm that provides SINRs to all the SUs above a threshold value maintaining acceptable interferences to PUs caused by SUs in the cognitive radio network. Our simulation result compares the performance of IRLS solution with the WLS solution and shows the convergence behavior of our algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/WOCN.2010.5587314","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 Seventh International Conference on Wireless and Optical Communications Networks - (WOCN)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5579766/5587304/05587314.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5587304","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WOCN.2010.5587314","publicationTitle":"2010 Seventh International Conference on Wireless and Optical Communications Networks - (WOCN)","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A robust uplink power control for cognitive radio networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5587314","pubTopics":[{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 Sept. 2010","displayDocTitle":"A robust uplink power control for cognitive radio networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5587314/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5587314/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11559075","dateOfInsertion":"27 September 2010","conferenceDate":"6-8 Sept. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A robust uplink power control for cognitive radio networks","confLoc":"Colombo, Sri Lanka","sourcePdf":"s114.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056562S","chronDate":"6-8 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5579766","isNumber":"5587304","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5579766","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5587304","articleId":"5587314","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":5587330,"authors":[{"name":"Ibrahim Abdel Hafiz El Rube","affiliation":["Department of the Electronics and Communications Engineering College of Engineering and Technology, Arab Academy for Science, Technology and Maritime Transport, Alexandria, Egypt","Department of the Electronics and Communications Eng., College of Engineering and Technology, Alexandria, Egypt"],"lastName":"Ibrahim Abdel Hafiz El Rube","id":"37086895065"},{"name":"Nour El-din El-Madany","affiliation":["Department of the Electronics and Communications Engineering College of Engineering and Technology, Arab Academy for Science, Technology and Maritime Transport, Alexandria, Egypt","Department of the Electronics and Communications Eng., College of Engineering and Technology, Alexandria, Egypt"],"lastName":"Nour El-din El-Madany","id":"37086890095"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7204-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7203-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-7202-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1811-3923"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2151-7703"}],"articleNumber":"5587330","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":314},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Quadrature amplitude modulation","Artificial neural networks","Feature extraction","Phase shift keying","Classification algorithms","Digital modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["modulation","neural nets","pattern classification","radiocommunication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive digital modulation classifier","artificial neural networks","NGN","automatic cognitive classification","wireless communication signals","M-ary PSK modulation","M-ary QAM modulation","FSK modulation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Automatic Modulation Classification","Neural Network","Multilayer preceptron"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5587330","abstract":"An automatic cognitive classification scheme for modulation is developed and presented in this paper.

The technique exploits the location diversity of terminals in the ground segment (stations) and the Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) mathematical frames (also known as `Network MIMO'). In this technique these diverse terminals are linked to a control unit (e.g. the hub) to coordinate the joint transmission\\ detection in the up and down links respectively. The other pillar to this technique is the use of special antenna-site-distribution structures (in the form of Uniform Linear Arrays- ULA) to provide the Uncorrelated High Rank (UHR) channel in the presence of the strong Line Of Sight (LOS) as is usual in satellite links. The relation between the range, wavelength and the antenna separation products are examined for different ranges corresponding to different orbits from Low Earth Orbit (LEO) to Geostationary Earth Orbit (GEO)- this with respect to the proposed technique. The presented results are analysed. An outline of the applications of the technique and its merits is concluded with.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radio access networks","MIMO","Mixers","Arrays","Wireless communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["aperture antennas","Earth orbit","linear antenna arrays","MIMO communication","satellite antennas","satellite links","telecommunication network topology","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["very small aperture terminal","satellite network topology","multiple antenna sites","link performance","terminal location diversity","ground segment","multiple input multiple output","MIMO mathematical frame","network MIMO","antenna-site-distribution structure","uniform linear array","uncorrelated high rank channel","UHR channel","line of sight","satellite link","antenna separation product","low Earth orbit","geostationary Earth orbit"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Very Small Aperture Terminal (VSAT)","Satellite networks","Multiple Antenna Sites (MAS)","Multi Input Multi Output (MIMO)","Uniform Linear Arrays (ULA)","Network MIMO"]}],"doi":"10.1109/WOCN.2010.5587371","publicationTitle":"2010 Seventh International Conference on Wireless and Optical Communications Networks - (WOCN)","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 Seventh International Conference on Wireless and Optical Communications Networks - (WOCN)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5579766/5587304/05587371.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5587304","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WOCN.2010.5587371","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new generation of Very Small Aperture Terminal and satellite networks topology exploiting diversity of Multiple Antenna Sites","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5587371","pubTopics":[{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A new generation of Very Small Aperture Terminal and satellite networks topology exploiting diversity of Multiple Antenna Sites","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5587371/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5587371/","accessionNumber":"11559132","conferenceDate":"6-8 Sept. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"27 September 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 Sept. 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new generation of Very Small Aperture Terminal and satellite networks topology exploiting diversity of Multiple Antenna Sites","confLoc":"Colombo, Sri Lanka","sourcePdf":"s013.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046996S","chronDate":"6-8 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5579766","isNumber":"5587304","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5579766","xplore-issue":"5587304","articleId":"5587371","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":5587372,"authors":[{"name":"Uthpala Premarathne","affiliation":["SLT VisionCom PVT LTD, Colombo 04, Sri Lanka"],"firstName":"Uthpala","lastName":"Premarathne","id":"37860244800"},{"name":"Kithsiri Samarasinghe","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Telecommunication Engineering, University of Moratuwa, Moratuwa, Sri Lanka"],"firstName":"Kithsiri","lastName":"Samarasinghe","id":"37403421000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7204-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7203-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-7202-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1811-3923"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2151-7703"}],"articleNumber":"5587372","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":126},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neurons","Irrigation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["satellite links","scintillation","time series"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["time series prediction","Ku band satellite links","Sri Lanka","atmospheric impairment","signal strength measurements","statistical prediction analysis","tropospheric scintillation effect","nonlinear prediction","fuzzy prediction","neural prediction"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Satellite links","short-term scintillation","scintillation prediction","loglogistic probability distribution function","time series prediction","fuzzy prediction","neural prediction"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5587372","abstract":"Scintillation effect is a dominant atmospheric impairment among the various contributing factors for low fade margin communication systems operating on high frequency bands such as Ku.

This paper discusses the time series based statistical prediction analysis of tropospheric scintillation effect. The experiment was performed under clear sky conditions where the other attenuation contributions such as rain, dense clouds is minimum. The experiment was setup at the University of Moratuwa, Sri Lanka using a Ku band satellite downlink operating on a moderately high elevation angle of 45 degrees. The time series analysis was performed using linear, non-linear, fuzzy and neural prediction techniques. The results show that though the error of prediction is low for a fuzzy predictor, the neural and non-linear predictors are better in analysing the statistical properties of the predictor results.","doi":"10.1109/WOCN.2010.5587372","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WOCN.2010.5587372","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 Seventh International Conference on Wireless and Optical Communications Networks - (WOCN)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5579766/5587304/05587372.pdf","publicationTitle":"2010 Seventh International Conference on Wireless and Optical Communications Networks - (WOCN)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5587304","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Time series prediction of short term scintillations of Ku band satellite links in Sri Lanka","pubTopics":[{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 Sept. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Time series prediction of short term scintillations of Ku band satellite links in Sri Lanka","conferenceDate":"6-8 Sept. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"27 September 2010","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5587372/","accessionNumber":"11559133","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5587372/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Time series prediction of short term scintillations of Ku band satellite links in Sri Lanka","confLoc":"Colombo, Sri Lanka","sourcePdf":"s014.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076517S","chronDate":"6-8 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5579766","isNumber":"5587304","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5579766","xplore-issue":"5587304","articleId":"5587372","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":5587414,"authors":[{"name":"David M.J.

LFM signals are of longer duration than pulsed signals of the same bandwidth; consequently, in many practical situations, maintaining temporal separation between echoes is not possible. Where analysis is performed on individual LFM signals, a separation technique is required. Time windowing is unable to separate signals overlapping in time. Frequency domain filtering is unable to separate signals with overlapping spectra. This paper describes a method to separate time-overlapping LFM signals through the application of the fractional Fourier transform (FrFT), a transform operating in both time and frequency domains. A short introduction to the FrFT and its operation and calculation are presented. The proposed signal separation method is illustrated by application to a simulated ultrasound signal, created by the summation of multiple time-overlapping LFM signals and the component signals recovered with \u00b10.6% spectral error. The results of an experimental investigation are presented in which the proposed separation method is applied to time-overlapping LFM signals created by the transmission of a LFM signal through a stainless steel plate and water-filled pipe.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Separation of overlapping linear frequency modulated (LFM) signals using the fractional fourier transform","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","doi":"10.1109/TUFFC.2010.1693","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/58/5587380/05587414.pdf","startPage":"2324","endPage":"2333","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TUFFC.2010.1693","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5587380","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5587414","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5587414/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 September 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"October  2010","displayDocTitle":"Separation of overlapping linear frequency modulated (LFM) signals using the fractional fourier transform","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"57","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/5587414/","dateOfInsertion":"30 September 2010","publicationDate":"October 2010","accessionNumber":"11560254","pubMedId":"20889420","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Separation of overlapping linear frequency modulated (LFM) signals using the fractional fourier transform","sourcePdf":"t10a2324.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.078938S","chronDate":"October  2010","xplore-pub-id":"58","isNumber":"5587380","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"58","citationCount":"82","xplore-issue":"5587380","articleId":"5587414","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5587771,"authors":[{"name":"Tao-Hsing Chang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, National Kaohsiung University of Applied Sciences, Kaohsiung, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Tao-Hsing","lastName":"Chang","id":"37633775600"},{"name":"Fu-Yuan Hsu","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, National Taiwan University of Science and Technology, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Fu-Yuan","lastName":"Hsu","id":"37890564300"},{"name":"Chia-Hoang Lee","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chia-Hoang","lastName":"Lee","id":"37336711200"},{"name":"Hahn-Ming Lee","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, National Taiwan University of Science and Technology, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Hahn-Ming","lastName":"Lee","id":"37292576600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6899-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6896-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6898-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5587771","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":154},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Tagging","Training","Hidden Markov models","Classification algorithms","Accuracy","Computer science","Computational linguistics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["natural language processing","statistical analysis","text analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["part-of-speech tagging","Chinese Unknown Words","contextual rules","Internet","statistics-based method","morphological rule"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Chinese unknown word","Morphological rule","Contextual rule","Domain-specific corpus","Part-of-speech tagging"]}],"abstract":"Many studies have tried to search useful information on the Internet by meaningful terms or words.

On the whole, experiments show that the model this paper proposed is very effective, and the F score is 49.72% in open test and 69.83% in word extraction respectively, which is an evident improvement over previous similar works.","doi":"10.1109/NLPKE.2010.5587846","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 6th International Conference on Natural Language Processing and Knowledge Engineering(NLPKE-2010)","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 6th International Conference on Natural Language Processing and Knowledge Engineering(NLPKE-2010)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5583927/5587762/05587846.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NLPKE.2010.5587846","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5587762","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A pragmatic model for new Chinese word extraction","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5587846","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A pragmatic model for new Chinese word extraction","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 Aug. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5587846/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"21-23 Aug. 2010","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2010","accessionNumber":"11568366","dateOfInsertion":"30 September 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5587846/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A pragmatic model for new Chinese word extraction","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"15.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.138366S","chronDate":"21-23 Aug. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5583927","isNumber":"5587762","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5583927","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5587762","articleId":"5587846","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5587873,"authors":[{"name":"Zhanwei Sun","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Notre Dame, Notre Dame, IN, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4200690/5689326/5587873/5587873-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Zhanwei Sun received the B.Sc. degree from Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China, in 2007, and the M.Sc. degree from the University of Notre Dame, Notre Dame, IN, in 2010.

In DSA networks, unlicensed secondary users can gain access to a licensed spectrum band as long as they do not cause harmful interfere to primary users. Spectrum sensing is subject to errors in the form of false alarms and missed detections. False alarms cause spectrum under-use by secondary users, and missed detections cause interference to primary users. Although existing research has demonstrated the utility of a Markov chain for modeling the spectrum access pattern of primary users over time, little effort has been directed toward spectrum sensing based upon such models. In this paper, we develop general sequence detection algorithms for Markov sources in noise for spectrum sensing in DSA networks. We assign different Bayesian cost factors for missed detections and false alarms, and we show that a suitably modified forward-backward sequence detection algorithm is optimal in minimizing the detection risk. Two advanced sequence detection algorithms, the complete forward algorithm and the complete forward partial backward algorithm are introduced and their performances are compared as well. Along the way, we observe new fundamental limitations on sensing performance that we term the risk floor and the window length limitation of energy detection and coherent detection that arise from mismatch of their observation window with the PU's spectrum access pattern.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSTSP.2010.2080661","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5689326","startPage":"97","endPage":"109","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4200690/5689326/05587873.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sequence Detection Algorithms for PHY-Layer Sensing in Dynamic Spectrum Access Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5587873/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 September 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5587873/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Sequence Detection Algorithms for PHY-Layer Sensing in Dynamic Spectrum Access Networks","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2011","accessionNumber":"11759851","dateOfInsertion":"17 January 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"5","issue":"1","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sequence Detection Algorithms for PHY-Layer Sensing in Dynamic Spectrum Access Networks","sourcePdf":"jstsp-sun-2080661-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.079758S","chronDate":"Feb.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"4200690","isNumber":"5689326","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4200690","citationCount":"32","xplore-issue":"5689326","articleId":"5587873","onlineDate":"30 September 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5587874,"authors":[{"name":"Carmine Miccoli","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Elettronica e Informazione, Politecnico di Milano, Milan, Italy"],"firstName":"Carmine","lastName":"Miccoli","id":"37540566500"},{"name":"Christian Monzio Compagnoni","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Elettronica e Informazione, Politecnico di Milano, Milan, Italy"],"firstName":"Christian","lastName":"Monzio Compagnoni","id":"37284649300"},{"name":"Salvatore Maria Amoroso","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Elettronica e Informazione, Politecnico di Milano, Milan, Italy"],"firstName":"Salvatore Maria","lastName":"Amoroso","id":"37541687500"},{"name":"Alessio Spessot","affiliation":["Research and Development-Technology Development, Numonyx, Agrate-Brianza, Italy"],"firstName":"Alessio","lastName":"Spessot","id":"37396466000"},{"name":"Paolo Fantini","affiliation":["Research and Development-Technology Development, Numonyx, Agrate-Brianza, Italy"],"firstName":"Paolo","lastName":"Fantini","id":"37268164600"},{"name":"Angelo Visconti","affiliation":["Research and Development-Technology Development, Numonyx, Agrate-Brianza, Italy"],"firstName":"Angelo","lastName":"Visconti","id":"37268200900"},{"name":"Alessandro S.

Extending previous approaches that have been successfully applied to prove the forward completeness property (boundedness up to finite time), we address the boundedness for all time (up to infinity) problem. An example is constructed showing that this is not possible in general with the existing theoretical tools. To achieve boundedness for all time, a novel hysteresis-based deadzone scheme with resetting is introduced for the associated update laws. In this way, a unique, piecewise continuously differentiable solution is obtained while the error converges in finite time within some arbitrarily small region of the origin. Using the proposed modification, an adaptive NN tracking controller is designed for a class of multiple-input multiple-output nonlinear systems.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Further Results on the Use of Nussbaum Gains in Adaptive Neural Network Control","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","doi":"10.1109/TAC.2010.2078070","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/9/5638183/05587877.pdf","startPage":"2841","endPage":"2846","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAC.2010.2078070","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5638183","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5587877","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5587877/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 September 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2010","displayDocTitle":"Further Results on the Use of Nussbaum Gains in Adaptive Neural Network Control","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"55","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/5587877/","dateOfInsertion":"03 December 2010","publicationDate":"Dec. 2010","accessionNumber":"11685045","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Further Results on the Use of Nussbaum Gains in Adaptive Neural Network Control","sourcePdf":"tac-psillakis-2078070-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.068138S","chronDate":"Dec.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"9","isNumber":"5638183","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"5638183","articleId":"5587877","onlineDate":"30 September 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5587879,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaoheng Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California, Davis, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Xiaoheng","lastName":"Chen","id":"37536415300"},{"name":"Shu Lin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California, Davis, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Shu","lastName":"Lin","id":"37067204800"},{"name":"Venkatesh Akella","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California, Davis, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Venkatesh","lastName":"Akella","id":"37273557300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1549-7747"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-3791"}],"articleNumber":"5587879","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":34,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1234},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5587879","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decoding","Parity check codes","Multiplexing","Field programmable gate arrays","Arrays","Logic gates","Complexity theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["clocks","CMOS integrated circuits","cyclic codes","decoding","field programmable gate arrays","parity check codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["QSN","reconfigurable quasi-cyclic LDPC decoders","low-density parity-check","programmable circular-shift network","clock frequency","field-programmable gate array","complimentary metal-oxide-semiconductor library","Xilinx Virtex 4 FPGA"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Benes network","error correction codes","quasi-cyclic low-density parity-check (QC-LDPC) codes","very large scale integration","WiFi","WiMAX"]}],"abstract":"There is an increasing need for configurable quasi-cyclic low-density parity-check (QC-LDPC) decoders that can support a family of structurally compatible codes instead of a single code. The key component in a configurable QC-LDPC decoder is a programmable circular-shift network that supports cyclic shifts of any size up to a predefined maximum submatrix size. This paper presents a QC-LDPC shift network (QSN), which has two key advantages over state-of-the-art solutions in recent literature. First, the QSN reduces the number of stages in the critical path, which improves the clock frequency and makes it scalable, particularly in a field-programmable gate array (FPGA)-based implementation where an interconnect delay is dominant. Second, the QSN's control logic is simple to generate and occupies a significantly smaller area. The QSNs for a variety of codes suitable for emerging applications are implemented, targeting both a 180-nm Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Ltd. complimentary metal-oxide-semiconductor library and a Xilinx Virtex 4 FPGA. The proposed implementation is shown to be 2.1 times faster than the best known implementation in literature and requires almost eight times less control area. Furthermore, this paper presents analytical models of the critical-path and datapath complexity for arbitrary-sized submatrices and proves that the QSN indeed generates all the output combinations required for implementing reconfigurable QC-LDPC decoders.","doi":"10.1109/TCSII.2010.2067811","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSII.2010.2067811","startPage":"782","endPage":"786","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","pdfPath":"/iel5/8920/5605318/05587879.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5605318","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"QSN\u2014A Simple Circular-Shift Network for Reconfigurable Quasi-Cyclic LDPC Decoders","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5587879/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 September 2010","displayDocTitle":"QSN\u2014A Simple Circular-Shift Network for Reconfigurable Quasi-Cyclic LDPC Decoders","volume":"57","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"18 October 2010","accessionNumber":"11588617","publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5587879/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"QSN\u2014A Simple Circular-Shift Network for Reconfigurable Quasi-Cyclic LDPC Decoders","sourcePdf":"tcsii-chen-2067811-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.101665S","chronDate":"Oct.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"8920","isNumber":"5605318","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8920","citationCount":"34","xplore-issue":"5605318","articleId":"5587879","onlineDate":"30 September 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5587880,"authors":[{"name":"Kyung Ki Kim","affiliation":["School of Electronic Engineering, Daegu University, Gyeongsan, South Korea"],"firstName":"Kyung Ki","lastName":"Kim","id":"37280247700"},{"name":"Wei Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Illinois Institute of Technology, Chicago, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Wang","id":"37406409500"},{"name":"Ken Choi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Illinois Institute of Technology, Chicago, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Ken","lastName":"Choi","id":"37402857200"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1549-7747"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-3791"}],"articleNumber":"5587880","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":74,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":2180},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Stress","Human computer interaction","Threshold voltage","Temperature sensors","Monitoring","Degradation","Integrated circuit modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ageing","CMOS integrated circuits","comparators (circuits)","hot carriers","integrated circuit reliability","invertors","MOSFET circuits","nanoelectronics","performance evaluation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["on-chip aging sensor circuits","nanometer MOSFET digital circuits","performance-degradation monitoring","adaptive design techniques","aging phenomena","negative bias temperature instability","NBTI","hot carrier injection","HCI","threshold voltage detector","performance degradation monitoring","aged MOSFET","threshold voltage difference","inverter chain","phase comparator","phase difference resolution","threshold voltage shift","temperature variation","symmetrical circuit structures","CMOS technology","post-layout power consumption"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Aging","degradation","hot carrier injection (HCI)","negative bias temperature instability (NBTI)","reliability"]}],"abstract":"Accurate performance-degradation monitoring of nanometer MOSFET digital circuits is one of the most critical issues in adaptive design techniques for overcoming the performance degradation due to aging phenomena such as negative bias temperature instability (NBTI) and hot carrier injection (HCI). Therefore, this paper proposes new on-chip aging sensor circuits which deploy a threshold voltage detector for monitoring the performance degradation of an aged MOSFET. The new aging sensor circuits measure the threshold voltage difference between a NBTI/HCI stressed MOSFET device and a NBTI/HCI unstressed MOSFET device using an inverter chain and a phase comparator and digitalize the phase difference induced by the threshold voltage difference. The proposed sensor circuits achieve a direct correlation between the threshold voltage degradation and the phase difference (a phase difference resolution of 1 ns per 0.01 V threshold voltage shift).

Hence, issues related to the reduction of PWM harmonics injection in the power grid are becoming more relevant. The use of high-order filters like \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">LCL</i>\n filters is a standard solution to provide the proper attenuation of PWM carrier and sideband voltage harmonics. However, those grid filters introduce potentially unstable dynamics that should be properly damped either passively or actively. The second solution suffers from control and system complexity (a high number of sensors and a high-order controller), even if it is more attractive due to the absence of losses in the damping resistors and due to its flexibility. An interesting and straightforward active damping solution consists in plugging in, in cascade to the main controller, a filter that should damp the unstable dynamics. No more sensors are needed, but there are open issues such as preserving the bandwidth, robustness, and limited complexity. This paper provides a systematic approach to the design of filter-based active damping methods. The tuning procedures, performance, robustness, and limitations of the different solutions are discussed with theoretical analysis, selected simulation, and experimental results.","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2010.2081952","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/5947747/05587887.pdf","startPage":"3623","endPage":"3633","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2010.2081952","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5947747","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Filter-Based Active Damping of Voltage Source Converters With - Filter","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5587887/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 September 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2011","displayDocTitle":"Filter-Based Active Damping of Voltage Source Converters With <formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex Notation=\"TeX\">$LCL$</tex></formula> Filter","volume":"58","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2011","accessionNumber":"12157675","htmlLink":"/document/5587887/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"12 July 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Filter-Based Active Damping of Voltage Source Converters With <formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex Notation=\"TeX\">$LCL$</tex></formula> Filter","sourcePdf":"tie-dannehl-2081952-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.106547S","chronDate":"Aug.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"5947747","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"435","xplore-issue":"5947747","articleId":"5587887","onlineDate":"30 September 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5587888,"authors":[{"name":"Antonino Di Gerlando","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Politecnico di Milano, Milan, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/5979518/5587888/5587888-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Antonino Di Gerlando (M'93) received the Laurea degree in electrical engineering from the Politecnico di Milano, Milano, Italy, in 1981.","Currently, he is a Full Professor with the Department of Electrical Engineering, Politecnico di Milano.

This model allows a resolver manufacturer to manipulate certain in-process controllable variables in order to readjust already assembled resolvers that, without any action, would be scrapped for the production line. The developed model follows a two-step strategy where, on a first step, a traditional transformer's model computes the resolver nominal conditions and, on a second step, a linear model computes the corrections on the controllable variables, in order to compensate small deviations in design assumptions, caused by the variability of the manufacturing process. An experimental methodology for parameter identification is presented. The linearized model develops a complete new approach to simulate the product characteristics of a pancake resolver from the knowledge of manufacturer controllable variables (winding parameters). This model had been simulated and experimentally tested in a resolver manufacturing plant. The performed tests prove the efficiency of the developed model, stabilizing the product specifications in a dynamic environment with high variability of the production processes.

The approach is based on obtaining a 2-D time-frequency plot representing the time-frequency evolution of the main components in an electrical machine transient current. The identification of characteristic patterns in the time-frequency plane caused by many of the fault-related components enables a reliable machine diagnosis. Unlike other continuous-wavelet-transform-based methods, this work uses frequency B-spline (FBS) wavelets. It is shown that these wavelets enable an efficient filtering in the region neighboring the main frequency, as well as enable a high level of detail in the time-frequency maps. As a consequence, the evolution of the most important current components is precisely traced. These characteristics make it easy to identify the patterns related to the fault components. The technique is applied to the experimental no-load start-up current of motors in a healthy state and with broken bars; the FBS capabilities are revealed. One of the novelties of this paper is the fact that the diagnosis is carried out via the identification not only of the traditional lower sideband harmonic but also of the upper sideband harmonic and four additional fault-related components.","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2010.2081955","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/5747179/05587892.pdf","startPage":"1530","endPage":"1544","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2010.2081955","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5747179","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Induction Motor Diagnosis Based on a Transient Current Analytic Wavelet Transform via Frequency B-Splines","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5587892","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 September 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5587892/","displayDocTitle":"Induction Motor Diagnosis Based on a Transient Current Analytic Wavelet Transform via Frequency B-Splines","volume":"58","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 2011","accessionNumber":"11929559","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5587892/","dateOfInsertion":"11 April 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Induction Motor Diagnosis Based on a Transient Current Analytic Wavelet Transform via Frequency B-Splines","sourcePdf":"tie-ponsllinares-2081955-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.12228S","chronDate":"May  2011","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"5747179","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"107","xplore-issue":"5747179","articleId":"5587892","onlineDate":"30 September 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5587894,"authors":[{"name":"Z.

In this paper, we mathematically analyze the performance of n-channel symmetric FEC-based multiple description coding for a progressive mode of transmission over orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) networks in a frequency-selective slowly-varying Rayleigh faded environment. We derive the expressions for the bounds of the throughput and distortion performance of the system in an explicit closed form, whereas the exact performance is given by an expression in the form of a single integration. Based on this analysis, the performance of the system can be numerically evaluated. Our results show that at high SNR, the multiple description encoder does not need to fine-tune the optimization parameters of the system due to the correlated nature of the subcarriers. It is also shown that, despite the bursty nature of the errors in a slow fading environment, FEC-based multiple description coding without temporal coding provides a greater advantage for smaller description sizes.","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2010.2081682","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/83/5733951/05587895.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2010.2081682","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5733951","startPage":"1061","endPage":"1076","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance Analysis of --Channel Symmetric FEC-Based Multiple Description Coding for OFDM Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5587895","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Performance Analysis of <formula formulatype=\"inline\"> <tex Notation=\"TeX\">$n$</tex></formula>-Channel Symmetric FEC-Based Multiple Description Coding for OFDM Networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5587895/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 September 2010","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"20","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 2011","accessionNumber":"11874762","pubMedId":"20889429","dateOfInsertion":"17 March 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5587895/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance Analysis of <formula formulatype=\"inline\"> <tex Notation=\"TeX\">$n$</tex></formula>-Channel Symmetric FEC-Based Multiple Description Coding for OFDM Networks","sourcePdf":"tip-chang-2081682-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.113136S","chronDate":"April  2011","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"5733951","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"5733951","articleId":"5587895","onlineDate":"30 September 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5587899,"authors":[{"name":"Hiroaki Kakigano","affiliation":["Division of Electrical Electronic and Information Engineering, Osaka University, Osaka, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/5675792/5587899/5587899-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Hiroaki Kakigano (M'06) was born in 1976.

While most of the microgrids adopt ac distribution as well as conventional power systems, dc microgrids are proposed and researched for the good connection with dc output type sources such as photovoltaic (PV) system, fuel cell, and secondary battery. Moreover, if loads in the system are supplied with dc power, the conversion losses from sources to loads are reduced compared with ac microgrid. As one of the dc microgrids, we propose \u201clow-voltage bipolar-type dc microgrid,\u201d which can supply super high quality power with three-wire dc distribution line. In this paper, one system for a residential complex is presented as an instance of the dc microgrid. In this system, each house has a cogeneration system (CGS) such as gas engine and fuel cell. The output electric power is shared among the houses, and the total power can be controlled by changing the running number of CGSs. Super capacitors are chosen as main energy storage. To confirm the fundamental characteristics and system operations, we experimented with a laboratory scale system. The results showed that the proposed system could supply high-quality power under several conditions.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5587899/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 September 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2010","volume":"25","issue":"12","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11704443","dateOfInsertion":"23 December 2010","publicationDate":"Dec. 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5587899/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Low-Voltage Bipolar-Type DC Microgrid for Super High Quality Distribution","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low-Voltage Bipolar-Type DC Microgrid for Super High Quality Distribution","sourcePdf":"tpel-kakigano-2077682-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.106609S","chronDate":"Dec.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"5675792","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"640","xplore-issue":"5675792","articleId":"5587899","onlineDate":"30 September 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-24"},{"_id":5587912,"authors":[{"name":"Peter Meibom","affiliation":["Risoe DTU, Technical University of Denmark, Roskilde, Denmark"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/59/5958775/5587912/5587912-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Peter Meibom (M'08) received the M.Sc.

The schedules are updated in a rolling manner as more up-to-date information becomes available. This is a fundamental change relative to day-ahead unit commitment approaches. The need for reserves dependent on forecast horizon and share of wind power has been estimated with a statistical model combining load and wind power forecast errors with scenarios of forced outages. The model is used to study operational impacts of future high wind penetrations for the island of Ireland. Results show that at least 6000 MW of wind (34% of energy demand) can be integrated into the island of Ireland without significant curtailment and reliability problems.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/59/5958775/05587912.pdf","startPage":"1367","endPage":"1379","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","doi":"10.1109/TPWRS.2010.2070848","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRS.2010.2070848","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5958775","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5587912","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Stochastic Optimization Model to Study the Operational Impacts of High Wind Penetrations in Ireland","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wind power generation","Wind forecasting","Electricity","Planning","Stochastic processes","Power systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["integer programming","linear programming","load forecasting","scheduling","stochastic processes","wind power plants"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["stochastic optimization model","high wind penetrations","Ireland","stochastic mixed integer linear optimization scheduling model","wind power production","day-ahead unit commitment approach","statistical model","wind power forecast errors","power 6000 MW"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Energy policy","forecast errors","reserves","unit commitment and dispatch","wind power"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5587912/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 September 2010","displayDocTitle":"Stochastic Optimization Model to Study the Operational Impacts of High Wind Penetrations in Ireland","volume":"26","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/5587912/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2011","accessionNumber":"12175065","dateOfInsertion":"22 July 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Stochastic Optimization Model to Study the Operational Impacts of High Wind Penetrations in Ireland","sourcePdf":"tpwrs-meibom-2070848-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.114032S","chronDate":"Aug.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"59","isNumber":"5958775","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"229","xplore-issue":"5958775","articleId":"5587912","onlineDate":"30 September 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5587955,"authors":[{"name":"Weiqi Xue","affiliation":["DTU Fotonik, Department of Photonics Engineering, Technical University of Denmark, Kongens Lyngby, Denmark"],"firstName":"Weiqi","lastName":"Xue","id":"37302519000"},{"name":"Jesper M\u00f8rk","affiliation":["DTU Fotonik, Department of Photonics Engineering, Technical University of Denmark, Kongens Lyngby, Denmark"],"firstName":"Jesper","lastName":"M\u00f8rk","id":"37277862700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-4-88552-246-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6785-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-4-88552-246-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-8884"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-8892"}],"articleNumber":"5587955","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":92},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Delay effects","Semiconductor optical amplifiers","Microwave amplifiers","Optical attenuators","Optical wavelength conversion","Microwave photonics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optical modulation","semiconductor optical amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["microwave photonic true time delay","cross gain modulation","semiconductor optical amplifiers","microwave time delays","counter-propagation configuration"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5587955","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5587915","publicationTitle":"OECC 2010 Technical Digest","displayPublicationTitle":"OECC 2010 Technical Digest","pdfPath":"/iel5/5577382/5587915/05587955.pdf","startPage":"202","endPage":"203","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Microwave photonic true time delay based on cross gain modulation in semiconductor optical amplifiers","abstract":"We experimentally demonstrate microwave time delays in a semiconductor optical amplifier by cross gain modulation.

Identification methods employed off-line can also be used outside of the traditional on-line prediction scenarios. These methods can assist in the design of damping mitigation devices for critical small signal mode events. In this paper, several scenarios will be studied to determine the present level of damping for small signal disturbances. Next, a damping mitigation device will be added and tuned to improve damping performance. A recently proposed orthogonal polynomial algorithm will be used to estimate the damping improvement from the mitigating devices. Frequencies and their associated damping levels in the pre- and post-mitigation cases will be identified using this new method along with a Prony assessment. Several examples will show the flexibility of this new estimation method as a design tool for tuning damping devices.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5588115/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-29 July 2010","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"25-29 July 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5588115/","dateOfInsertion":"30 September 2010","publicationDate":"July 2010","accessionNumber":"11570671","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Small signal mode damping mitigation using orthogonal polynomials","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Small signal mode damping mitigation using orthogonal polynomials","confLoc":"Minneapolis, MN, USA","sourcePdf":"PESGM2010000020.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078244S","chronDate":"25-29 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5577387","isNumber":"5588047","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5577387","xplore-issue":"5588047","articleId":"5588115","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5588133,"authors":[{"name":"Iman Sadinezhad","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Information Engineering, University of Sydney, NSW, Australia"],"firstName":"Iman","lastName":"Sadinezhad","id":"37393487800"},{"name":"Vassilios G.

A very low sampling rate is used to implement the proposed ANN-EKF structure with the modest hardware demands. The ANN structure is used for spectral estimation, consumes a very low processing power, and needs a few samples per cycle for real-time implementation. An EKF performs a secondary process on the ANN fundamental frequency phasor estimation to recover it from the errors due to the ANN internal setting. The presented ANN-EKF structure is a very simple and intelligent module to be used by utilities for statistical assessment of harmonics/interharmonics pollution. Besides, it can be a part of utility practices to control, compress, and process large volume of information flowing into data centers through sensors to be placed across the future intelligent power grids. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated by simulations in MATLAB-Simulink environment and confirmed by experimental results.","doi":"10.1109/PES.2010.5588133","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PES.2010.5588133","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE PES General Meeting","pdfPath":"/iel5/5577387/5588047/05588133.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE PES General Meeting","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5588047","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Undersampled on-line ANN-EKF based estimation of harmonics/interharmonics in power systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"25-29 July 2010","displayDocTitle":"Undersampled on-line ANN-EKF based estimation of harmonics/interharmonics in power systems","conferenceDate":"25-29 July 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2010","dateOfInsertion":"30 September 2010","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5588133/","accessionNumber":"11570729","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5588133/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Undersampled on-line ANN-EKF based estimation of harmonics/interharmonics in power systems","confLoc":"Minneapolis, MN, USA","sourcePdf":"PESGM2010000408.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.089284S","chronDate":"25-29 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5577387","isNumber":"5588047","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5577387","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5588047","articleId":"5588133","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5588141,"authors":[{"name":"Iman Sadinezhad","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Information Engineering, University of Sydney, NSW, Australia"],"firstName":"Iman","lastName":"Sadinezhad","id":"37393487800"},{"name":"Vassilios G.

A non-linear non-recursive Newton algorithm is utilized to track the modulation effect of frequency variation on the on-line estimation of the phase angle. The LS curve fitting technique extracts the instantaneous power system frequency from the time-varying phase angle estimation by the NTA. A very low sampling rate is adopted to realize the introduced NTA-LS optimization technique and compare its performance with the decomposition of single-phase into orthogonal components (DSPOC) algorithm and the NTA. The presented slow sampling NTA-LS structure is a very efficient real-time algorithm and promises to reduce the hardware complexity, alleviate the runtime jams in digital signal processors (DSPs), and rectify the need for wide bandwidth sensors. The performance of the proposed method is tested by presenting simulations in MATLAB-Simulink which prove the robustness and accuracy of the NTA-LS method under time-varying conditions.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Frequency estimation","Estimation","Signal processing algorithms","Power system dynamics","Time frequency analysis","Discrete Fourier transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["curve fitting","digital signal processing chips","frequency estimation","least squares approximations","Newton method","optimisation","power supply quality","power system security","power system stability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["slow sampling online optimization approach","instantaneous power system frequency estimation","least square method","nonlinear nonrecursive Newton algorithm","modulation effect tracking","frequency variation","LS curve fitting technique","NTA-LS optimization technique","slow sampling NTA-LS structure","hardware complexity","digital signal processors","DSP","bandwidth sensors","MATLAB-Simulink","time-varying phase angle estimation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Digital signal processors","frequency estimation","least squares methods","Newton method","power quality"]}],"doi":"10.1109/PES.2010.5588141","publicationTitle":"IEEE PES General Meeting","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE PES General Meeting","pdfPath":"/iel5/5577387/5588047/05588141.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5588047","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PES.2010.5588141","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Slow sampling on-line optimization approach to estimate power system frequency","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5588141","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Slow sampling on-line optimization approach to estimate power system frequency","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5588141/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5588141/","accessionNumber":"11570736","conferenceDate":"25-29 July 2010","dateOfInsertion":"30 September 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-29 July 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Slow sampling on-line optimization approach to estimate power system frequency","confLoc":"Minneapolis, MN, USA","sourcePdf":"PESGM2010000407.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076453S","chronDate":"25-29 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5577387","isNumber":"5588047","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5577387","xplore-issue":"5588047","articleId":"5588141","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5588169,"authors":[{"name":"Xiang Zheng","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Zhejiang, Hangzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5577387/5588047/5588169/5588169-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Xiang Zheng was born in Zhejiang, China, in October 1983.

In this paper, an active damping control strategy for the SSSC is proposed to mitigate subsynchronous resonance (SSR) in the series compensated power system. A multimode controller design method is developed to suppress multiple unstable torsional frequencies separately. The modified IEEE first benchmark model with SSSC for subsynchronous resonance investigation is adopted to perform the studies. The simulation results show that, with a small rating of the SSSC, the proposed controller can provide positive electrical damping around the torsional frequencies and is effective to mitigate the torsional interaction between the electrical network and turbine-generator shafts.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Damping","Torque","Resonant frequency","Generators","Capacitors","Transfer functions","Frequency measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["control system synthesis","damping","flexible AC transmission systems","interference suppression","power transmission control","static VAr compensators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["static synchronous series compensator","active damping controller","SSSC","subsynchronous resonance","multimode controller design method","unstable torsional frequency suppression","flexible AC transmission system controller","FACTS controller","series compensated power system","positive electrical damping","torsional interaction mitigation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["static synchronous series compensator (SSSC)","subsynchronous resonance (SSR)","active damping controller","multimode","time domain simulation"]}],"doi":"10.1109/PES.2010.5588169","publicationTitle":"IEEE PES General Meeting","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE PES General Meeting","pdfPath":"/iel5/5577387/5588047/05588169.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5588047","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PES.2010.5588169","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Active damping controller design for SSSC to mitigate subsynchronous resonance","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5588169","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Active damping controller design for SSSC to mitigate subsynchronous resonance","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5588169/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5588169/","accessionNumber":"11570875","conferenceDate":"25-29 July 2010","dateOfInsertion":"30 September 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-29 July 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Active damping controller design for SSSC to mitigate subsynchronous resonance","confLoc":"Providence, RI","sourcePdf":"PESGM2010000502.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061079S","chronDate":"25-29 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5577387","isNumber":"5588047","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5577387","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5588047","articleId":"5588169","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":5588206,"authors":[{"name":"H.

Wireless communication becomes an attractive option as communication network in some cases, such as small amount of data communication for extremely remote substation, remote debugging temporarily for newly-built generation plants and backup communication. This paper presents a communication system using general packet radio service(GPRS) and code division multiple access (CDMA) wireless communication networks in SCADA system. Several technologies for GPRS and CDMA networks such as Access Point Name(APN), IP security protocol(IPSec), Virtual Private Network(VPN), packet assembly disassembly and dual-network online synchronously have been newly developed. Pilot project as proof-of-concept in Henan province of China was done, before going for large scale deployment. It is eventually revealed that, although being a little slower in response to sudden faults in power networks if compared with wired communication networks, this wireless communication system is still of great significance to many practical uses in SCADA system.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient application of GPRS and CDMA networks in SCADA system","publicationTitle":"IEEE PES General Meeting","doi":"10.1109/PES.2010.5588206","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE PES General Meeting","pdfPath":"/iel5/5577387/5588047/05588206.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PES.2010.5588206","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5588047","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5588206","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5588206/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-29 July 2010","displayDocTitle":"Efficient application of GPRS and CDMA networks in SCADA system","conferenceDate":"25-29 July 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5588206/","dateOfInsertion":"30 September 2010","publicationDate":"July 2010","accessionNumber":"11571023","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient application of GPRS and CDMA networks in SCADA system","confLoc":"Minneapolis, MN, USA","sourcePdf":"PESGM2010000563.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071476S","chronDate":"25-29 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5577387","isNumber":"5588047","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5577387","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"5588047","articleId":"5588206","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":5588231,"authors":[{"name":"W.

The genetic operators (crossover and mutation) are adjusted self-adaptively by fuzzy controller and good convergent character and global optimization are improved. Based on the PML-FDTD method, the fitness value is established by taking the sum of weighted performance index function of crosstalk and return loss, through which is optimized the crosstalk between T-shape microstrip line and adjacent line in the ground plane. Comparing the simulation results of the fitness function using different parameters, numerical results demonstrate that the crosstalk is decreased 8dB which is caused by T-shape microstrip line and adjacent line above the photonic band gap ground.

QoS controls are used to ensure non-critical applications do not hamper the operation of critical ones, all the while providing fair access to all legitimate applications. QoS systems are increasingly being used as firewalls, filtering bad traffic and allowing good traffic to traverse the network without delay.

data storage and capacity with flexible scalable computing processing power to match elastic demand and supply, whilst reducing capital expenditure. However the opportunity cost of the successful implementation of Cloud computing is to effectively manage the security in the cloud applications. Security consciousness and concerns arise as soon as one begins to run applications beyond the designated firewall and move closer towards the public domain. The purpose of the paper is to provide an overall security perspective of Cloud computing with the aim to highlight the security concerns that should be properly addressed and managed to realize the full potential of Cloud computing. Gartner's list on cloud security issues, as well the findings from the International Data Corporation enterprise panel survey based on cloud threats, will be discussed in this paper.","doi":"10.1109/ISSA.2010.5588290","publicationTitle":"2010 Information Security for South Africa","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 Information Security for South

mathematical analysis for the sampling-based metric calculation for turbo decoding of noncoherent BFSK (NCBFSK) in additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channels, towards application in tactical applications. It is known that for NCBFSK, two decision statistics having Rician and Rayleigh characteristics must be accounted for in the decoding process. Therefore, this paper clarifies the means of using the two NCBFSK demodulator outputs so that sampling-based turbo decoding can be realized in simulation. Results for the simulations of the named waveform performances are shown for turbo coding rates 1/3, 2/3 and 3/4 under AWGN and a comparative assessment is presented.","startPage":"351","endPage":"355","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2010 International Symposium on Performance Evaluation of Computer and Telecommunication Systems (SPECTS '10)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5581169/5587938/05588292.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2010 International Symposium on Performance Evaluation of Computer and Telecommunication Systems (SPECTS '10)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5587938","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Implementation of sampling-based turbo decoder for noncoherent BFSK under Gaussian noise","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 July 2010","displayDocTitle":"Implementation of sampling-based turbo decoder for noncoherent BFSK under Gaussian noise","conferenceDate":"11-14 July 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2010","dateOfInsertion":"07 October 2010","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5588292/","accessionNumber":"11577029","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5588292/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Implementation of sampling-based turbo decoder for noncoherent BFSK under Gaussian noise","confLoc":"Ottawa, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"0247cameraready.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051403S","chronDate":"11-14 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5581169","isNumber":"5587938","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5581169","xplore-issue":"5587938","articleId":"5588292","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Society for Modeling & Simu","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5588312,"authors":[{"name":"K.

By jointly diagonalizing the time delay correlation matrix of the observed signals and using the improved new non-orthogonal joint diagonalization (NOJD), a better solution of BSS under lower SNR can be achieved. The simulation result shows that the proposed algorithm can successfully separate communication signals with SNR as low as 10dB under conditions such as the source number is unknown or dynamically changing, and in the over-determined mode regardless of the signals' modulation methods. We use Signal to Interference Ratio (SIR), Crosstalk Error(CTE) and Correlation Coefficient as the performance indexes to prove the superiority of the proposed algorithm over the classical

Trajectory tracking control is very important in MIS. In this paper, dynamic structure and equation of motion including the effect of rotor inertia for a class of 3-dof tendon-driven minimally invasive instruments were established. An adaptive controller based on model block approximation RBF neural network was designed for a class of 3-dof tendon-driven minimally invasive instruments. In addition, the neural network modeling errors can be easily suppressed by incorporating robust control. Trajectory tracking control numerical simulation was carried out.

Higher system throughput using higher order modulation is traded for higher output. In WiMAX higher modulation tends to be used close to the base station whereas lower order modulations tends to be used at longer range. The dependency of distance might sometimes be deceiving, as channel conditions can vary considerably especially in a mobile environment. In this paper we present a cognitive approach to alter the modulation and code rate using a cognitive engine that is based on linguistic and uncertainty reasoning as well as estimating the channel type. The cognitive engine controls the type of modulation and code rate in order to maintain a good system throughput without wasting available bandwidth. Fuzzy logic reasoning in the cognitive engine was chosen because it is well suited for situations of uncertainty, incompleteness and heterogeneity information, in the case of fast changing radio environments. The results showed that new combinations of modulation type and code rate should be considered in WiMAX since it outperforms the standard in spectral efficiency, especially in a fast changing radio environment.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 July 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5588580/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"11577030","publicationDate":"July 2010","conferenceDate":"11-14 July 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5588580/","dateOfInsertion":"07 October 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive modulation and coding for WiMAX systems with vague channel state information using cognitive radio","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive modulation and coding for WiMAX systems with vague channel state information using cognitive radio","confLoc":"Ottawa, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"0391cameraready.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068075S","chronDate":"11-14 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5581169","isNumber":"5587938","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5581169","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5587938","articleId":"5588580","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Society for Modeling & Simu","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5588583,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaozhu Xie","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, Academy of Armored Force Engineering, Beijing 100072 CHINA"],"firstName":"Xiaozhu","lastName":"Xie","id":"37087186505"},{"name":"Weining Cui","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, Academy of Armored Force Engineering, Beijing 100072 CHINA"],"firstName":"Weining","lastName":"Cui","id":"37087187161"},{"name":"Min Liu","affiliation":["School of Space Navigation Technology, Beijing Institute of Technology, CHINA 100081"],"firstName":"Min","lastName":"Liu","id":"37087185094"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5140-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5141-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2152-744X"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2152-7431"},{"format":"CD","value":"2152-7431"}],"articleNumber":"5588583","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":104},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Artificial neural networks","Backstepping","Adaptive systems","Equations","Uncertainty","Nonlinear systems","Robustness"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cerebellar model arithmetic computers","Lyapunov methods","robust control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["robust adaptive backstepping controller design","CMAC neural network","nonlinear system","virtual controller","closed loop control system","Lyapunov sense"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5588583","abstract":"A robust adaptive backstepping controller design method is proposed for a nonlinear system with uncertainty and unknown parameters based on the CMAC neural network.

obtain a good management of system resources and service continuity, by making advanced bandwidth reservation on the Access Points (APs) where a generic user will move into. The prediction algorithm is based on two types of neural networks: the first one predicts the next cell by considering the current position and the direction of the host when the service request starts and the second one is recursively applied on previous predictions to obtain the sequence of predicted cells based on the past history. The choice of a \u201cnext cell\u201d during the prediction phase is made by considering the probability that the user moves toward a specific adjacent cell. We hypothesize that users move according to the Smooth Random Mobility Model (SRMM) and the performance of the prediction system are analyzed in terms of prediction error for different hand-off events.","startPage":"38","endPage":"43","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2010 International Symposium on Performance Evaluation of Computer and Telecommunication Systems (SPECTS '10)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5581169/5587938/05588656.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2010 International Symposium on Performance Evaluation of Computer and Telecommunication Systems (SPECTS '10)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5587938","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel passive bandwidth reservation algorithm based on Neural Networks path prediction in wireless environments","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 July 2010","displayDocTitle":"A novel passive bandwidth reservation algorithm based on Neural Networks path prediction in wireless environments","conferenceDate":"11-14 July 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2010","dateOfInsertion":"07 October 2010","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5588656/","accessionNumber":"11577049","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5588656/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel passive bandwidth reservation algorithm based on Neural Networks path prediction in wireless environments","confLoc":"Ottawa, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"0246cameraready.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049995S","chronDate":"11-14 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5581169","isNumber":"5587938","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5581169","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5587938","articleId":"5588656","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Society for Modeling & Simu","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5588695,"authors":[{"name":"Xiangbin Yu","affiliation":["College of Information Science and Technology, Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Nanjing, China","National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, South-East University, Nanjing, China"],"lastName":"Xiangbin Yu","id":"37280836300"},{"name":"TingTing Zhou","affiliation":["College of Information Science and Technology, Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Nanjing, China"],"lastName":"TingTing Zhou","id":"37594705400"},{"name":"YanFeng Li","affiliation":["College of Information Science and Technology, Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Nanjing, China"],"lastName":"YanFeng Li","id":"37598952700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7478-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7475-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-7477-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5588695","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":90},"abstract":"Considering that existing space-time coded CDMA (STC-CDMA) system has high decoding complexity, we design a low-complexity multiuser receiver scheme for imperfect channel state information (CSI) in this paper. The scheme can make full use of the complex orthogonality of STC to simplify the high decoding complexity of the existing scheme, and achieve almost the same performance as the existing scheme. Compared with full-diversity STC-CDMA, the given full-rate STC-CDMA can realize full data rate, low complexity and partial diversity, and form efficient spatial interleaving. Thus the system performance will be improved greatly when concatenated with the channel coding. Simulation results show that the designed receiver scheme is valid and reasonable, the multiuser system performance with imperfect CSI is worse than that with perfect CSI due to the estimation error.

The charge collection with the parasitic bipolar conduction compromise the SEU hardened design, thus causing upsets.","doi":"10.1109/ICCSNA.2010.5588729","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCSNA.2010.5588729","publicationTitle":"2010 Second International Conference on Communication Systems, Networks and Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 Second International Conference on Communication Systems, Networks and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5581174/5588666/05588729.pdf","startPage":"316","endPage":"320","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5588666","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5588729/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 29 2010-July 1 2010","displayDocTitle":"Highly-scaled SRAM immunity to MNU based on analysis of an induced parasitic bipolar effect","isConference":true,"volume":"1","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"29 June-1 July 2010","accessionNumber":"11571917","htmlLink":"/document/5588729/","dateOfInsertion":"30 September 2010","publicationDate":"June 2010","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Highly-scaled SRAM immunity to MNU based on analysis of an induced parasitic bipolar effect","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"316.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060163S","chronDate":"June 29 2010-July 1 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5581174","isNumber":"5588666","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5581174","xplore-issue":"5588666","articleId":"5588729","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5588740,"authors":[{"name":"Zhenyu Wang","affiliation":["School of Automation, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zhenyu","lastName":"Wang","id":"37695138100"},{"name":"Yaping Dai","affiliation":["School of Automation, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yaping","lastName":"Dai","id":"37278734400"},{"name":"Yuan Yao","affiliation":["School of Automation, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Yuan Yao","id":"37087286166"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7478-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7475-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-7477-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5588740","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":133},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5588740","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Artificial neural networks","Integrated optics","Robots","Adaptive optics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dynamic programming","genetic algorithms","learning (artificial intelligence)","nonlinear systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["parallel learning","adaptive dynamic programming","genetic algorithm","utility function","global searching","fast learning speed","inverted pendulum system control"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["adaptive dynamic programming","utility function","genetic algorithms","inverted pendulum control"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICCSNA.2010.5588740","pdfPath":"/iel5/5581174/5588666/05588740.pdf","publicationTitle":"2010 Second International Conference on Communication Systems, Networks and Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 Second International Conference on Communication Systems, Networks and Applications","startPage":"350","endPage":"353","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5588666","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCSNA.2010.5588740","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Research of a parallel learning adaptive dynamic programming based on genetic algorithms","abstract":"In adaptive dynamic programming (ADP), the utility function is always completely designed by experience which cannot evaluate system cost very well.

First, a normal utility function of ADP was designed according to the error between current states and expected values. Second, genetic algorithms (GAs) were used to search for the optimal parameters of utility function in ADP. Finally, we employed GAADP on an inverted pendulum system control. The simulation experiments indicated that GAADP method can increase the learning speed and easily achieve the balancing state.

On the other hand, to cope with frequency selective fading channels, OFDM systems can be applied to transform the channels into multiple flat fading channels and solve the multipath induced ISI problem. Therefore, combining OFDM with transmit diversity can provide reliable and high-rate transmission in wide-area cellular networks. For the decoding of space-time or space-frequency coded OFDM transmit diversity systems, efficient channel estimation methods have to be developed at the receiver to obtain the up-to-date channel state information. However, channel estimation and tracking in OFDM transmit diversity systems suffers from high computation complexity due to the simultaneous estimation of channel parameters of all transmit antennas. In this paper, we first investigate the issue of estimation bias in the reduced complexity algorithm. Two bias removal schemes will then be proposed by exploiting the temporal correlation of channel responses. Simulation results show that the proposed methods can greatly reduce the estimation MSE of the reduced complexity algorithm for high frequency selective and fast fading channels.","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 Second International Conference on Communication Systems, Networks and

Typically, each cognitive transmission process consists of two required phases, i.e., the spectrum sensing and the data transmission phases. To improve the overall system performance of cognitive transmissions, we propose a cognitive relay scheme where a cognitive relay is used for both the spectrum sensing and the data transmission phases. By jointly considering the two phases, we derive an exact closed-form expression of the spectrum efficiency for the proposed scheme, which is to quantify the percentage of spectrum holes utilized by cognitive users for their successful data transmissions. Numerical results show that a significant performance improvement is obtained in terms of the spectrum efficiency by using the proposed cognitive relay transmission scheme. In addition, it is shown that a maximum spectrum efficiency can be achieved through a tradeoff in determining the time durations for the spectrum sensing and data transmission phases.","doi":"10.1109/ICCSNA.2010.5588776","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 Second International Conference on Communication Systems, Networks and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5581174/5588666/05588776.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5588666","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCSNA.2010.5588776","publicationTitle":"2010 Second International Conference on Communication Systems, Networks and Applications","startPage":"59","endPage":"62","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spectrum efficiency of cognitive relay transmissions with cooperative diversity in cognitive radio networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5588776","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 29 2010-July 1 2010","displayDocTitle":"Spectrum efficiency of cognitive relay transmissions with cooperative diversity in cognitive radio networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5588776/","isConference":true,"volume":"1","htmlLink":"/document/5588776/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2010","accessionNumber":"11571948","dateOfInsertion":"30 September 2010","conferenceDate":"29 June-1 July 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spectrum efficiency of cognitive relay transmissions with cooperative diversity in cognitive radio networks","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"059.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06224S","chronDate":"June 29 2010-July 1 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5581174","isNumber":"5588666","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5581174","xplore-issue":"5588666","articleId":"5588776","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5588886,"authors":[{"name":"Mengkun Li","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Technology, China University of Petroleum, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Mengkun Li","id":"38195180500"},{"name":"Ming Chen","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Technology, China University of Petroleum, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Ming Chen","id":"37539620300"},{"name":"Jun Xie","affiliation":["College of Information Engineering, Capital Normal University, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Jun Xie","id":"37537513400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7478-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7475-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-7477-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5588886","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":485},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optimization","Bandwidth","Clouds"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["game theory","Internet","optimisation","resource allocation","scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","resource service management","cross-domain resource sharing","cross-domain service integration","scheduling strategy","game theory","performance optimization","price optimization","synthesis-based resource allocation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cloud Resource Service","Synthesis","Scheduling"]}],"abstract":"A computational is a wide-area computing environment for cross-domain resource sharing and service integration.

Because the data produced by sensor nodes should also provide geographical location of these nodes. So having a reliable localization algorithm is always necessary. Most of presented algorithms for localization of sensor networks considered situations that the sensor nodes are static. In some of sensor networks, the nodes are mobile. So, using static localization algorithms in these networks is not suitable. Thus to support the mobility of nodes in these networks a localization algorithm will be needed that must be consistent with the mobility of nodes. Two important localization algorithms that presented in this area are Monte Carlo localization algorithm (MCL) and its improvement Monte Carlo localization boxed (MCB). Despite having a good localization accurately, sampling in these algorithms is static and they have high energy consumption. Also these algorithms are not able to localize sensor nodes in some circumstances. The main reason is that in some time slots the node can not hear any seed node. In this paper a new method has been suggested that uses forecasting and dynamic sampling for localization. This method has the ability of nodes localization in these conditions and that is an energy efficient method.

Therefore, the robustness of adaptive beamforming techniques against environmental and array imperfections is one of the key issues. Compared with traditional methods, robust beamforming brings about many improvements on array performances. In this paper, we present a brief review on recent developments of robust adaptive beamforming. After introducing the traditional MVDR based robust beamforming, we emphasize the new robust beamforming which uses the Support Vector Machines (SVMs) to improve the generalization performance over the traditional techniques. This paper presents the modified SVM-based cost function and illustrates how it can be used to linear beamforming. Simulation results show that the proposed SVM-based beamformer has the desired robust performance both in no-mismatch and mismatch situations.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5589024/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 Aug. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"07 October 2010","accessionNumber":"11576445","htmlLink":"/document/5589024/","conferenceDate":"4-7 Aug. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Research on the algorithms of robust adaptive beamforming","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Research on the algorithms of robust adaptive beamforming","confLoc":"Xi'an, China","sourcePdf":"ICMA10134.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067012S","chronDate":"4-7 Aug. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5579871","isNumber":"5587913","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5579871","xplore-issue":"5587913","articleId":"5589024","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5589034,"authors":[{"name":"Lei Wang","affiliation":["Center of Micro-system Technology, Shenyang Ligong University, Shenyang, China"],"firstName":"Lei","lastName":"Wang","id":"37716609100"},{"name":"Yongping Hao","affiliation":["Mechanical Engineering College, Shenyang Ligong University, Shenyang, China"],"firstName":"Yongping","lastName":"Hao","id":"37649453700"},{"name":"Zesong Wei","affiliation":["Mechanical Engineering College, Shenyang Ligong University, China"],"lastName":"Zesong Wei","id":"37087697853"},{"name":"Fei Wang","affiliation":["Mechanical Engineering & Automation College, Northeastern University, Shenyang, China"],"firstName":"Fei","lastName":"Wang","id":"37088321246"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5140-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5141-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2152-744X"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2152-7431"},{"format":"CD","value":"2152-7431"}],"articleNumber":"5589034","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":873},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sensors","Micromechanical devices","Accelerometers","Calibration","Global Positioning System","Testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["calibration","field programmable gate arrays","Global Positioning System","inertial navigation","microsensors","statistical analysis","system-on-chip"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["calibration procedure","MEMS inertial sensor testing","FPGA-based GPS-INS System","field programmable gate array","Global Positioning System","inertial navigation system","inertial measurement units","microelectromechanical systems","Allan variance method"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5589034","abstract":"Given the burgeoning demand for a small, lightweight, consume very little power, low-cost high performance inertial Measurement Units(IMU), test methods are necessary to evaluate the current state of the available of Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems(MEMS) technology.

The numerical distributions of different chaotic sequences were analyzed in this paper, and the chaotic sequences were introduced into particle swarm optimization to improve the ergodicity of particles in feasible region. After analysing all the constraints, the method of controlling the principal components of variables by controlling the constraints of the problem was proposed, and it was used to improve the efficiency of chaotic particle swarm optimization. Besides, the neglect of some key conditions was eliminated with the ergodicity of chaotic map. The numerical experiments showed that, the chaotic particle swarm optimization which based on tent map and improved logistic map had shorter running time but higher efficiency than basic particle swarm optimization. After all the analysis, the improved chaotic particle swarm optimization was used to search the best principal dimensions of a real ship in this paper, and the calculating example showed that the new

We face the single input single output (SISO) model to show how the statistical information about the multipath channel can be exploited to further improve our estimation of the a posteriori probabilities (APP) during the equalization process. We consider not only the uncertainty due to the noise in the channel, but also in the estimate of the channel estate information (CSI). Thus, we resort to a Bayesian approach for the computation of the APP. This novel algorithm has the same complexity as the BCJR, exhibiting lower bit error rate at the output of the channel decoder than the standard BCJR that considers maximum likelihood (ML) to estimate the CSI.","doi":"10.1109/MLSP.2010.5589201","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Workshop on Machine Learning for Signal Processing","startPage":"53","endPage":"58","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MLSP.2010.5589201","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5587981","pdfPath":"/iel5/5576742/5587981/05589201.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Workshop on Machine Learning for Signal Processing","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bayesian methods","Decoding","Bit error rate","Markov processes","Equalizers","Training","Channel estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Bayes methods","digital communication","equalisers","error statistics","maximum likelihood decoding","probability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Bayesian BCJR","channel decoding","probabilistic channel equalization","digital communications","single input single output model","SISO model","statistical information","multipath channel","a posteriori probability","channel estate information","bit error rate","maximum likelihood estimation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Bayesian BCJR for channel equalization and decoding","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5589201/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5589201/","accessionNumber":"11576335","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"07 October 2010","publicationDate":"Aug. 2010","conferenceDate":"29 Aug.-1 Sept. 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 29 2010-Sept. 1 2010","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bayesian BCJR for channel equalization and decoding","confLoc":"Kittila, Finland","sourcePdf":"109paper97.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055181S","chronDate":"Aug. 29 2010-Sept. 1 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5576742","isNumber":"5587981","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5576742","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5587981","articleId":"5589201","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5589207,"authors":[{"name":"Harry C.

We propose a new method for the challenge of frequency control participation in ac grids connected by a multi-terminal HVDC system. Since HVDC transmission is very often used to exchange a contracted amount of bulk power between different synchronous systems, the primary frequency response characteristic of one ac grid is not by itself transferred to other terminals connected to the dc grid or to other synchronous ac grids. This functionality can, however, be implemented by a special frequency control solution at the converter stations. The control scheme proposed in this paper combines frequency droop control of ac grids with that of dc voltage droop control in dc grids so that all ac grids connected to the dc grid can contribute to frequency support at the point of common coupling. Simulation results from an EMTDC/PSCAD model of a four-terminal HVDC system have illustrated the robust performance of the proposed control method during frequency variations in different terminals.","doi":"10.1109/PES.2010.5589327","publicationTitle":"IEEE PES General Meeting","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE PES General Meeting","pdfPath":"/iel5/5577387/5588047/05589327.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PES.2010.5589327","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5588047","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Primary frequency control of remote grids connected by multi-terminal HVDC","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5589327","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-29 July 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5589327/","displayDocTitle":"Primary frequency control of remote grids connected by multi-terminal HVDC","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2010","accessionNumber":"11571029","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5589327/","conferenceDate":"25-29 July 2010","dateOfInsertion":"30 September 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Primary frequency control of remote grids connected by multi-terminal HVDC","confLoc":"Minneapolis, MN, USA","sourcePdf":"PESGM2010000183.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041453S","chronDate":"25-29 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5577387","isNumber":"5588047","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5577387","citationCount":"81","xplore-issue":"5588047","articleId":"5589327","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5589368,"authors":[{"name":"Ali Nourai","affiliation":["American Electric Power Company, Inc., USA"],"firstName":"Ali","lastName":"Nourai","id":"37337821000"},{"name":"Ram Sastry","affiliation":["American Electric Power Company, Inc., USA"],"firstName":"Ram","lastName":"Sastry","id":"38196077200"},{"name":"Thomas Walker","affiliation":["American Electric Power Company, Inc., USA"],"firstName":"Thomas","lastName":"Walker","id":"38196621400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6551-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6549-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6550-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8357-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1932-5517"},{"format":"CD","value":"1944-9925"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1944-9925"}],"articleNumber":"5589368","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":18,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":498},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5589368","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Batteries","Substations","Power system reliability","Standardization","Business"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electric power generation","energy storage","renewable energy sources","substations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy storage deployment","electric utilities","renewable generation","time-shifting","distributed energy storage"]}],"abstract":"Energy storage is increasingly seen as a wise investment and an operational necessity for electric utilities.

Two methods discussed are offline machine learning and a realtime sliding window procedure. In using machine learning techniques it is possible to assert a classifier algorithm, which to a certain degree of accuracy can flag incoming data for further operation when applied in realtime. The open source project Hadoop provides the storage architecture for large datasets (petabyte scale) as well as the MapReduce computational framework for distributed computing to produce these classifiers. Additionally, a sliding window of realtime data can be used to present a longer data sample window than the device report rate allowing for a heuristic hysteresis approach. The open source openPDC promotes the implementation of the classifier and sliding window in a realtime environment operating on new measurements thirty times a second.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE PES General Meeting","pdfPath":"/iel5/5577387/5588047/05589479.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"IEEE PES General Meeting","doi":"10.1109/PES.2010.5589479","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PES.2010.5589479","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5588047","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5589479","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Machine learning and windowed subsecond event detection on PMU data via Hadoop and the openPDC","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Event detection","Oscillators","Training","Phasor measurement units","Algorithm design and analysis","Monitoring","Computer architecture"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["learning (artificial intelligence)","phase measurement","power engineering computing","power system measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["machine learning","windowed subsecond event detection","phasor measurement units","Hadoop project","openPDC","realtime anomaly detection","realtime sliding window procedure","classifier algorithm","MapReduce computational framework","heuristic hysteresis approach"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["openPDC","synchrophasor","Hadoop","PMU"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5589479/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-29 July 2010","displayDocTitle":"Machine learning and windowed subsecond event detection on PMU data via Hadoop and the openPDC","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5589479/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2010","accessionNumber":"11571464","dateOfInsertion":"30 September 2010","conferenceDate":"25-29 July 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Machine learning and windowed subsecond event detection on PMU data via Hadoop and the openPDC","confLoc":"Minneapolis, MN, USA","sourcePdf":"PESGM2010000640.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059992S","chronDate":"25-29 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5577387","isNumber":"5588047","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5577387","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"5588047","articleId":"5589479","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5589509,"authors":[{"name":"Bharadwaj R.

Future distribution systems with increased deployment of distributed energy storage devices and distributed energy resources are being designed under the aegis of a number of sectors of the power engineering community. This includes the National Science Foundation supported Future Renewable Electric Energy Distribution Management (FREEDM) center. A technical roadmap for the FREEDM center distribution system is proposed that is based on multiobjective optimization. Diverse objectives in the optimal control of the distribution energy management system are handled through a Pareto optimal approach. The normal boundary intersection method is used to develop a Pareto optimal front and solving the multiobjective optimization subroutine has been approached through separable programming techniques. Uncertainty in load demand and distributed resource power output are incorporated in the test cases studied to formulate a robust algorithm for distribution energy management. The paper also makes brief reference to the Smart Grid and its objectives - and how the proposed distribution energy management fits into this initiative.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE PES General Meeting","pdfPath":"/iel5/5577387/5588047/05589509.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","publicationTitle":"IEEE PES General Meeting","doi":"10.1109/PES.2010.5589509","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PES.2010.5589509","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5588047","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5589509","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A roadmap for distribution energy management via multiobjective optimization","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optimization","Energy management","Energy storage","Converters","Programming","Minimization","Density estimation robust algorithm"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed power generation","energy management systems","linear programming","Pareto optimisation","power system management","smart power grids"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distribution energy management system","multiobjective optimization","power distribution systems","distributed energy storage devices","distributed energy resources","FREEDM center distribution system","Future Renewable Electric Energy Distribution Management center","National Science Foundation","optimal control","Pareto optimal approach","normal boundary intersection method","smart grid","linear programming techniques"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Distribution engineering","multiobjective optimization","energy management","renewable generation","\u2018smart grid\u2019","Pareto optimization","robust optimization","linear programming","normal boundary intersection","separable programming"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5589509/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-29 July 2010","displayDocTitle":"A roadmap for distribution energy management via multiobjective optimization","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5589509/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2010","accessionNumber":"11570638","dateOfInsertion":"30 September 2010","conferenceDate":"25-29 July 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A roadmap for distribution energy management via multiobjective optimization","confLoc":"Minneapolis, MN, USA","sourcePdf":"PESGM2010000655.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058334S","chronDate":"25-29 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5577387","isNumber":"5588047","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5577387","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"5588047","articleId":"5589509","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5589546,"authors":[{"name":"N.

This allows more straight-forward and widespread integration of distributed generation. More advanced MicroGrids (stage 2) can further add the capability to isolate such small sections of the network and continue to operate them during main network disturbances. This can improve power quality to users. This paper examines the marginal value of a MicroGrid upgrade from stage 1 to stage 2. A sensitivity analysis establishes that the primary economic barrier is the (still large) initial capital cost of the power electronics required, and to a lesser extent the system power losses. While justifiable in specific cases, the widespread use of MicroGrids for power quality improvement, would however first require further development in power electronics to reduce device costs and increase converter efficiencies.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Assessing marginal value of stage 2 Microgrids","publicationTitle":"IEEE PES General Meeting","doi":"10.1109/PES.2010.5589546","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE PES General Meeting","pdfPath":"/iel5/5577387/5588047/05589546.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PES.2010.5589546","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5588047","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5589546","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5589546/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-29 July 2010","displayDocTitle":"Assessing marginal value of stage 2 Microgrids","conferenceDate":"25-29 July 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5589546/","dateOfInsertion":"30 September 2010","publicationDate":"July 2010","accessionNumber":"11570757","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Assessing marginal value of stage 2 Microgrids","confLoc":"Minneapolis, MN, USA","sourcePdf":"PESGM2010000942.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.086417S","chronDate":"25-29 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5577387","isNumber":"5588047","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5577387","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5588047","articleId":"5589546","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":5589556,"authors":[{"name":"W.

The proposed WADC incorporates a generalized predictive control (GPC) to generate the optimized future control sequences and a network delay compensator (NDC) to compensate the communication delays actively. A recursive least-squares algorithm (RLSA) with a variable forgetting factor is used to identify the predictive model in order to overcome the effect of the model inaccuracy of the large-scale power system. Simulation studies undertaken on a two-area four-machine power system show that the proposed WADC can damp the inter-area mode oscillations effectively and compensate the communication delays existing in the wide-area signals in an active way. Moreover, the results obtained in the comparison with the WADC based on GPC are also provided.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5589556/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-29 July 2010","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"25-29 July 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5589556/","dateOfInsertion":"30 September 2010","publicationDate":"July 2010","accessionNumber":"11570825","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Design of wide-area damping controllers based on networked predictive control considering communication delays","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of wide-area damping controllers based on networked predictive control considering communication delays","confLoc":"Minneapolis, MN, USA","sourcePdf":"PESGM2010000919.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073622S","chronDate":"25-29 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5577387","isNumber":"5588047","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5577387","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"5588047","articleId":"5589556","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":5589600,"authors":[{"name":"Liangyu Ma","affiliation":["Automation Department, School of Control and Computer Engineering, North China Electric Power University, Baoding, Hebei, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5577387/5588047/5589600/5589600-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Liangyu Ma received his B.S. degree in Thermal Power Engineering in 1993 from North China Electric Power University (NCEPU), Baoding, China.

Two inverse dynamic neural network (NN) models referring to the first-stage and the second-stage water-spray attemperators are constructed separately. To achieve highly accurate approximation of the superheater system, the NN models are trained with sufficient historical data in a wide operating range, which consists of both different steady-state conditions and dynamic transients. Then the IDNCs are designed based on the well-trained IDPMs and applied to superheater steam temperature control. In order to eliminate the steady-state control error arisen by the model error, a simple feedback PID compensator is added to an inverse controller. Detailed control tests are carried out on a full-scope simulator for a 300MW coal-fired power generating unit.

In such a Smart Grid essential components are distributed over the complete infrastructure, in particular parts of the infrastructure will be placed under possibly hostile end-user's control. Thus, the dependability of the Smart Grid depends on the security of every component deployed. Considering the large variety of known attacks on IT infrastructures proper protection mechanisms need to be considered already in the early design of Smart Grid architecture and their components. The notion of Trusted Computing established in the PC area can also be used in Smart Grids to establish trust among all involved stakeholders and to ensure the proper functioning of devices. This paper discusses relevant security requirements and introduces a vision of a security infrastructure for energy networks built on hardware trust anchors.","doi":"10.1109/PES.2010.5589609","publicationTitle":"IEEE PES General Meeting","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE PES General Meeting","pdfPath":"/iel5/5577387/5588047/05589609.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PES.2010.5589609","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5588047","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Trust infrastructures for future energy networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5589609","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-29 July 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5589609/","displayDocTitle":"Trust infrastructures for future energy networks","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2010","accessionNumber":"11571044","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5589609/","conferenceDate":"25-29 July 2010","dateOfInsertion":"30 September 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Trust infrastructures for future energy networks","confLoc":"Minneapolis, MN, USA","sourcePdf":"PESGM2010000818.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065583S","chronDate":"25-29 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5577387","isNumber":"5588047","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5577387","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"5588047","articleId":"5589609","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-29"},{"_id":5589615,"authors":[{"name":"N.

To demonstrate the technique, we consider a radial distribution circuit with a single branch consisting of sequentially-arranged residential-scale loads that consume both real and reactive power. In parallel, some loads also have PV generation capability. We postulate that the inverters associated with each PV system are also capable of limited reactive power generation or consumption, and we seek to find the optimal dispatch of each inverter's reactive power to both maintain the voltage within an acceptable range and minimize the resistive losses over the entire circuit. We assume the complex impedance of the distribution circuit links and the instantaneous load and PV generation at each load are known. We compare the results of the optimal dispatch with a suboptimal local scheme that does not require any communication. On our model distribution circuit, we illustrate the feasibility of high levels of PV penetration and a significant (20% or higher) reduction in losses.","doi":"10.1109/PES.2010.5589663","publicationTitle":"IEEE PES General Meeting","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE PES General Meeting","pdfPath":"/iel5/5577387/5588047/05589663.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PES.2010.5589663","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5588047","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed control of reactive power flow in a radial distribution circuit with high photovoltaic penetration","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5589663","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-29 July 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5589663/","displayDocTitle":"Distributed control of reactive power flow in a radial distribution circuit with high photovoltaic penetration","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2010","accessionNumber":"11571218","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5589663/","conferenceDate":"25-29 July 2010","dateOfInsertion":"30 September 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed control of reactive power flow in a radial distribution circuit with high photovoltaic penetration","confLoc":"Minneapolis, MN, USA","sourcePdf":"PESGM2010000881.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.079772S","chronDate":"25-29 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5577387","isNumber":"5588047","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5577387","citationCount":"135","xplore-issue":"5588047","articleId":"5589663","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5589682,"authors":[{"name":"Norberto Garcia","affiliation":["Facultad de Ingenieria El\u00e9ctrica, Universidad Michoacana de San Nicol\u00e1s de Hidalgo, Mexico"],"bio":{"p":["Norberto Garcia received his first degree in electrical engineering from the Universidad Michoacana de San Nicol\u00e1s de Hidalgo (UMSNH), Morelia, M\u00e9xico, in 1993.

Virtual power players (VPP) can aggregate a diversity of players, namely generators and consumers, and a diversity of energy resources, including electricity generation based on several technologies, storage and demand response.

A combination of a rapidly aging North American power infrastructure, a clear trend towards distributed generation, and an emphasis on electrical reliability has spurred a shift toward a more distributed, decentralized power grid. The concept of the microgrid has dominated the discussion of power distribution on a localized level, while the smart grid model has been touted as the new macrogrid design paradigm. In order to bring together the microgrid and smart grid concepts, we propose the MMCS concept, which divide distribution systems into numerous microgrid-like regions, or MMCS regions, to facilitate the smart grid concepts of self-healing, intentional islanding, and anticipation for the entire distribution network while inheriting the dynamics of a microgrid. We implement the MMCS concept through the use of multi-agent systems.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE PES General Meeting","pdfPath":"/iel5/5577387/5588047/05589720.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"IEEE PES General Meeting","doi":"10.1109/PES.2010.5589720","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PES.2010.5589720","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5588047","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5589720","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-microgrid control systems (MMCS)","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Smart grids","Density estimation robust algorithm","Region 1","Power quality","Region 3","Multiagent systems","Power system dynamics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed power generation","multi-agent systems","power distribution reliability","smart power grids"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multi-microgrid control systems","smart grid","distributed generation","electrical reliability","decentralized power grid","power distribution","intentional islanding","multi-agent systems"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Power distribution","interconnected power systems","microgrid","smart grid","multi-agent systems"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5589720/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-29 July 2010","displayDocTitle":"Multi-microgrid control systems (MMCS)","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5589720/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2010","accessionNumber":"11571379","dateOfInsertion":"30 September 2010","conferenceDate":"25-29 July 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-microgrid control systems (MMCS)","confLoc":"Minneapolis, MN, USA","sourcePdf":"PESGM2010001596.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052261S","chronDate":"25-29 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5577387","isNumber":"5588047","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5577387","citationCount":"46","xplore-issue":"5588047","articleId":"5589720","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":5589736,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Despite their successful applications in a variety of areas, FPGA devices are just about to find their way into the control systems. In this paper, a general velocity estimation solution for on-chip FPGA implementation is presented. Possessing the advantages of both frequency count and period count methods, the proposed solution automatically covers a wide range of velocities. It behaves as a period counter at low velocities and also behaves as a frequency counter at high velocities. Remarkably, the division operation required by most period count methods is averted by using an accumulator to ease the FPGA-based implementation. The developed velocity estimation solution is experimentally compared to a classic frequency count method in terms of both velocity signal smoothness and position tracking control accuracy. Experimental results also reveal that the position control accuracy of harmonic drives is more sensitive to the velocity phase-lag than to the velocity smoothness.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5587913","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMA.2010.5589767","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Mechatronics and Automation","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Mechatronics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel5/5579871/5587913/05589767.pdf","startPage":"1069","endPage":"1074","doi":"10.1109/ICMA.2010.5589767","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FPGA-based velocity estimation for control of harmonic drives","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 Aug. 2010","displayDocTitle":"FPGA-based velocity estimation for control of harmonic drives","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"4-7 Aug. 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5589767/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2010","accessionNumber":"11576759","dateOfInsertion":"07 October 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5589767/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FPGA-based velocity estimation for control of harmonic drives","confLoc":"Xi'an, China","sourcePdf":"ICMA10194.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07671S","chronDate":"4-7 Aug. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5579871","isNumber":"5587913","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5579871","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5587913","articleId":"5589767","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5589795,"authors":[{"name":"R.

As part of ongoing investigations the authors are aiming to verify this proposed method with a realistic large scale Australian HV electricity transmission network.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Maximizing power system loadability by optimal allocation of svc using mixed integer linear programming","publicationTitle":"IEEE PES General Meeting","doi":"10.1109/PES.2010.5589795","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE PES General Meeting","pdfPath":"/iel5/5577387/5588047/05589795.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PES.2010.5589795","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5588047","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5589795","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5589795/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-29 July 2010","displayDocTitle":"Maximizing power system loadability by optimal allocation of svc using mixed integer linear programming","conferenceDate":"25-29 July 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5589795/","dateOfInsertion":"30 September 2010","publicationDate":"July 2010","accessionNumber":"11570696","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Maximizing power system loadability by optimal allocation of svc using mixed integer linear programming","confLoc":"Minneapolis, MN, USA","sourcePdf":"PESGM2010000954.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060887S","chronDate":"25-29 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5577387","isNumber":"5588047","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5577387","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"5588047","articleId":"5589795","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5589817,"authors":[{"name":"Jukka Turunen","affiliation":["Helsinki University of Technology, Espoo, Finland"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5577387/5588047/5589817/5589817-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jukka Turunen (S'07) received the M.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from Helsinki University of Technology (TKK) in 2005.

The proposed method was based on a modified Genetic Algorithm (GA). The problem of the SPA reduction was modeled as a mixed discrete-continuous optimization problem with various constraints. The objective function that needed to be minimized was the weighted sum of active power generation adjustments and load sheddings. Most inequality constraints were derived from the conditions under which the security of the power system operation was guaranteed. The acceptable limits of the SPA were also converted into additional constraints and integrated into the optimization problem. The modified GA was then used to solve the problem. In solving the problem, by incorporating the objective function and constraints, we applied a partial order relation defined by a better function to manage the constraints. Compared with a traditional penalty function method, this approach avoided the difficulties of setting coefficients for the penalty function. Simulations were carried out on the IEEE 118-bus system and the results proved the effectiveness of the proposed technique.","doi":"10.1109/PES.2010.5589852","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"IEEE PES General Meeting","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PES.2010.5589852","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5588047","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE PES General Meeting","pdfPath":"/iel5/5577387/5588047/05589852.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Genetic Algorithm method for Standing Phase Angle reduction in power system restoration","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5589852/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Genetic Algorithm method for Standing Phase Angle reduction in power system restoration","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5589852/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11570919","publicationDate":"July 2010","dateOfInsertion":"30 September 2010","conferenceDate":"25-29 July 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-29 July 2010","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Genetic Algorithm method for Standing Phase Angle reduction in power system restoration","confLoc":"Minneapolis, MN, USA","sourcePdf":"PESGM2010001021.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062407S","chronDate":"25-29 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5577387","isNumber":"5588047","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5577387","xplore-issue":"5588047","articleId":"5589852","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5589854,"authors":[{"name":"Tamer Kawady","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department Faculty of Engineering, Menoufia University, Egypt"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5577387/5588047/5589854/5589854-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Tamer AeKawady (M'02) was born in Shebin El-kom, Egypt on Sept. 30, 1972.

Control complexities and their unique dynamic characteristics may, however, raise different problems during abnormal or faulty operating conditions. Accordingly, the behavior of the associated protective elements at the Point of Common Coupling Point (PCC) may be affected during grid faults remarkably. These situations are investigated thoroughly in this paper. Detailed dynamic modeling of a 60 MW off-shore wind farm is utilized including the rotor protection circuitry with either crowbar or DC chopper. Also, the own protective functions of the rotor converters are considered. Different simulation examples are illustrated to clarify the related impacts of the DFIGs on utilized protective elements with large integrated wind farms.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5589854/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-29 July 2010","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"25-29 July 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5589854/","dateOfInsertion":"30 September 2010","publicationDate":"July 2010","accessionNumber":"11570921","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Protection system behavior of DFIG based wind farms for grid-faults with practical considerations","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Protection system behavior of DFIG based wind farms for grid-faults with practical considerations","confLoc":"Minneapolis, MN, USA","sourcePdf":"PESGM2010001118.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052891S","chronDate":"25-29 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5577387","isNumber":"5588047","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5577387","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"5588047","articleId":"5589854","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5589857,"authors":[{"name":"Chao Cai","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, South-East University, Nanjing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5577387/5588047/5589857/5589857-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Chao Cai was born in Taian, China, in Feb, 1985.

The protection intelligent electronic device (IED) in digital substation receives sampled data from different digital data sources (DDS) with digital interface based on IEC 61850-9-2 process bus. The mismatch in sampling rate between protection IED algorithms and different DDSs requires resampling in the protection IED to make sure the protection and other algorithms can run correctly. In this paper, a smart digital resampling scheme based on oversampling interpolator and quasi-continuous interpolator for fully digital relay protection is proposed. A computationally optimal poly-phase implementation structure and nyquist filter for the oversampling interpolator is designed and the Lagrange interpolation algorithm is chosen to approximate the impulse response of the quasi-continuous interpolator considering the reduction in error.

However, the widespread implementation of electric vehicles could lead to adverse effects on power system networks, especially existing distribution networks.

The network is examined under worst case scenario conditions for residential electricity demand in an effort to assess the full impact from electric vehicles. The results demonstrate that even for relatively modest levels of electric vehicle charging, both the voltage and thermal loading levels can exceed safe operating limits. The results also indicate the importance of assessing each phase on the network separately in order to capture the full effects of uncontrolled electric vehicle charging on the network.","doi":"10.1109/PES.2010.5589940","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5588047","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","pdfPath":"/iel5/5577387/5588047/05589940.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE PES General Meeting","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE PES General Meeting","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PES.2010.5589940","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Impact assessment of varying penetrations of electric vehicles on low voltage distribution systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Load modeling","Loading","Electricity","Batteries","Thermal loading","Substations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distribution networks","electric charge","electric vehicles","load forecasting"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electric vehicle charging","low voltage distribution systems","impact assessment","policy incentives","transport sector","power system networks","distribution networks","residential electricity demand","voltage loading level","thermal loading level"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["electric vehicles","load flow analysis","power distribution"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"25-29 July 2010","displayDocTitle":"Impact assessment of varying penetrations of electric vehicles on low voltage distribution systems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5589940/","dateOfInsertion":"30 September 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5589940/","accessionNumber":"11571284","publicationDate":"July 2010","conferenceDate":"25-29 July 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Impact assessment of varying penetrations of electric vehicles on low voltage distribution systems","confLoc":"Minneapolis, MN, USA","sourcePdf":"PESGM2010001241.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039956S","chronDate":"25-29 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5577387","isNumber":"5588047","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5577387","citationCount":"102","xplore-issue":"5588047","articleId":"5589940","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":5589941,"authors":[{"name":"Yousef Pipelzadeh","firstName":"Yousef","lastName":"Pipelzadeh","id":"37589895600"},{"name":"Balarko Chaudhuri","firstName":"Balarko","lastName":"Chaudhuri","id":"37272488000"},{"name":"Tim C Green","firstName":"Tim C","lastName":"Green","id":"37274764000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6551-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6549-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6550-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8357-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1932-5517"},{"format":"CD","value":"1944-9925"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1944-9925"}],"articleNumber":"5589941","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":36,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":970},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Damping","Power system dynamics","HVDC transmission","Oscillators","Benchmark testing","Stability analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["HVDC power transmission","power system control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wide-area power oscillation damping control","HVDC","Australian equivalent system","multivariable controller","high voltage direct current"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Power Oscillation Damping (POD)","High Voltage Direct Current (HVDC)","Wide-area Signals","Subspace System Identification","Pole-placement"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5589941","abstract":"A case study on the Australian equivalent system - recently adopted as an IEEE benchmark for stability studies - is presented here to illustrate power oscillation damping through HVDC links.

However, recursive phasor estimation, online frequency correction and adaptive phase-shift are involved which makes modeling such APPODs difficult in stability studies. Possible interaction with other controllers (e.g. lead-lag compensators) is thus unforeseeable restricting their acceptability in practice. In this paper potential interaction between an APPOD and a conventional POD (CPOD) is investigated. The study is primarily simulation based as mathematical analysis of such interaction is not straightforward due to highly complex non-linear nature of APPODs. Simulation results presented here show no adverse interaction which needs to be substantiated for large-scale systems.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Thyristors","Power capacitors","Damping","Oscillators","Adaptation model","Mathematical model","Static VAr compensators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive control","damping","mathematical analysis","power system control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive phasor power oscillation damping controllers","system models","recursive phasor estimation","online frequency correction","adaptive phase-shift","mathematical analysis"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Adaptive Control","Interaction","Phasor POD","Power Oscillation Damping Controller (POD)","Static VAr Compensator (SVC)","Thyristor Controlled Series Capacitor (TCSC)"]}],"doi":"10.1109/PES.2010.5589943","publicationTitle":"IEEE PES General Meeting","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE PES General Meeting","pdfPath":"/iel5/5577387/5588047/05589943.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5588047","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PES.2010.5589943","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Interaction between conventional and adaptive phasor power oscillation damping controllers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5589943","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Interaction between conventional and adaptive phasor power oscillation damping controllers","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5589943/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5589943/","accessionNumber":"11571286","conferenceDate":"25-29 July 2010","dateOfInsertion":"30 September 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-29 July 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Interaction between conventional and adaptive phasor power oscillation damping controllers","confLoc":"Minneapolis, MN, USA","sourcePdf":"PESGM2010001239.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059089S","chronDate":"25-29 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5577387","isNumber":"5588047","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5577387","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5588047","articleId":"5589943","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":5589950,"authors":[{"name":"Akram I.

It is shown that mechanical DC circuit breakers could only offer adequate protection if supplemented with fault current limiters. A simple electronic switch (IGBT or GTO) is suitable as a DC circuit breaker but the component sizing crucially depends on the speed of signal processing circuits. It is likely that significant component overrating will be required. The simple DC/DC converters are studied as DC circuit breakers and it is found that they offer some important advantages over series electronic switches. However DC/DC converters can not provide fault current interruption for all fault cases. A resonant high-power DC/DC converter is studied under extreme fault conditions. It is shown that the converter operates uninterrupted through most severe faults, and inherent stabilising properties prevent any overvoltage or extreme currents. The converter experiences overcurrents on faulted terminals at levels that can be tolerated by the thyristors. The detailed simulations demonstrate that the converter is capable of responding like an open circuit on unfaulted terminals. The impact of unbalanced DC line faults on a bipolar DC system is also discussed.","doi":"10.1109/PES.2010.5589953","publicationTitle":"IEEE PES General Meeting","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE PES General Meeting","pdfPath":"/iel5/5577387/5588047/05589953.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PES.2010.5589953","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5588047","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5589953","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fast fault current interruption on high-power DC networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-29 July 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5589953/","displayDocTitle":"Fast fault current interruption on high-power DC networks","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5589953/","publicationDate":"July 2010","dateOfInsertion":"30 September 2010","conferenceDate":"25-29 July 2010","accessionNumber":"11571293","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast fault current interruption on high-power DC networks","confLoc":"Minneapolis, MN, USA","sourcePdf":"PESGM2010001231.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077164S","chronDate":"25-29 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5577387","isNumber":"5588047","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5577387","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"5588047","articleId":"5589953","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5589959,"authors":[{"name":"Tao Hong","affiliation":["Quanta Technology, LLC, Raleigh, NC, USA","North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Tao Hong (S'06) is a Senior Engineer in Quanta Technology.

With the emerging development of smart grid technologies, demand side management (DSM) starts to attract the attention of electric utilities again. To perform a decent DSM, beyond when and how much the demand will be, the utilities are facing another question: why is the electricity being consumed? In other words, what are the factors driving the fluctuation of the electric load at a particular time period? Understanding this issue can also be beneficial for the electric load forecasting with the purpose of energy purchase. This paper proposes a modern treatment of a classic technique, multiple linear regression, to model the hourly demand and investigate the causality of the consumption of electric energy. Various interactions are discovered, discussed, tested, and interpreted in this paper. The proposed approach has been used to generate the 3-year hourly energy demand forecast for a US utility.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Load modeling","Linear regression","Load forecasting","Humans","Electricity","Artificial neural networks","Accuracy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["demand forecasting","demand side management","load forecasting","power system economics","purchasing","regression analysis","smart power grids"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hourly electric load forecasting","multiple linear regression","demand side management","smart grid technologies","energy purchasing","electric energy consumption","energy demand forecasting"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Load forecasting","load management","load modeling","multiple linear regression"]}],"doi":"10.1109/PES.2010.5589959","publicationTitle":"IEEE PES General Meeting","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE PES General Meeting","pdfPath":"/iel5/5577387/5588047/05589959.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5588047","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PES.2010.5589959","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modeling and forecasting hourly electric load by multiple linear regression with interactions","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5589959","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Modeling and forecasting hourly electric load by multiple linear regression with interactions","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5589959/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5589959/","accessionNumber":"11571340","conferenceDate":"25-29 July 2010","dateOfInsertion":"30 September 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-29 July 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modeling and forecasting hourly electric load by multiple linear regression with interactions","confLoc":"Minneapolis, MN, USA","sourcePdf":"PESGM2010001307.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070942S","chronDate":"25-29 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5577387","isNumber":"5588047","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5577387","citationCount":"34","xplore-issue":"5588047","articleId":"5589959","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-09"},{"_id":5589973,"authors":[{"name":"Fangxing Li","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Tennessee, Knoxville, TN, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Fangxing (Fran) Li (S'98, M'01, SM'05) received his BSEE and MSEE degrees both from Southeast University (China) in 1994 and 1997, respectively, and then his Ph.D. degree from Virginia Tech in 2001.

In particular, the limited fault current capability of inverter interfaced distributed generation (IIDG) could lead to malfunctioning of the distribution network protection system which largely relies on overcurrent based protection techniques. The absence of tried and tested models and methods to calculate the inverter fault current contribution has been a significant challenge to the introduction of IIDG. This paper shows that with a few subtle changes, conventional analytical network analysis techniques can be used to analyse the fault response of inverter dominated distribution networks. The theoretical results are validated by PSCAD simulations and experimental results.","doi":"10.1109/PES.2010.5589981","publicationTitle":"IEEE PES General Meeting","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE PES General Meeting","pdfPath":"/iel5/5577387/5588047/05589981.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PES.2010.5589981","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5588047","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fault response of grid-connected inverter dominated networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5589981","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-29 July 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5589981/","displayDocTitle":"Fault response of grid-connected inverter dominated networks","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2010","accessionNumber":"11571388","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5589981/","conferenceDate":"25-29 July 2010","dateOfInsertion":"30 September 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fault response of grid-connected inverter dominated networks","confLoc":"Minneapolis, MN, USA","sourcePdf":"PESGM2010001299.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062246S","chronDate":"25-29 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5577387","isNumber":"5588047","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5577387","citationCount":"81","xplore-issue":"5588047","articleId":"5589981","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-28"},{"_id":5589988,"authors":[{"name":"Palak P.
