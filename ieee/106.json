Devices running by attraction were the first to be built. When new magnets, which can be used in repulsion appeared on the market (SmCo\n<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">5</inf>\n), new types of passive magnetic bearings, running by repulsion, started to be made. Up to now, to our knowledge, most of the devices realized have been made with radially magnetized rings. We proved that for identically shaped bearings, strengths and stiffnesses were exactly the same in both magnetic configurations : radial and axial magnetization. The proof is only based on the rigidity of the magnetization. These results are still true for axial or radial passive bearings, and can also be used for devices in attraction. Ring shaped magnets with radial magnetization are usually made of several sectors stuck together. Axial magnetization is much easier to manufacture because large sized rings are already industrially provided.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Passive magnetic bearings with permanent magnets","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","doi":"10.1109/TMAG.1978.1060019","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/20/22833/01060019.pdf","startPage":"803","endPage":"805","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMAG.1978.1060019","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=22833","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1060019","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1060019/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1978","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1978","displayDocTitle":"Passive magnetic bearings with permanent magnets","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"14","issue":"5","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","publicationDate":"September 1978","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Passive magnetic bearings with permanent magnets","sourcePdf":"01060019.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.069691S","chronDate":"Sep 1978","isNumber":"22833","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"99","articleId":"1060019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1978","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1060108,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Control of the metal-semiconductor barrier, developed here for the super-Schottky, introduces a new technological tool for tailoring the properties of junction devices. Reducing the barrier height of Pb contacts to p-GaAs increases the conductivity of the junction, allowing a reduction in area to achieve the diode impedance required for matching. This area reduction decreases the shunt capacitance, which is the chief parasitic element of the super-Schottky diode at high frequencies. A second technique available for extending such devices to higher frequencies is the electrolithographically produced multiple contact array structure. This multiple contact concept requires exceptional uniformity in deposition of the metal contacts. Such uniformity is unattainable with conventional electroplating. A new high-field pulsed-plating technique has recently been developed to yield Schottky contact arrays with uniformly theoretical spreading resistances at diameters as small as 1200 A. Arrays with 100 individual diode contacts are now being routinely produced. The area reduction due to barrier height lowering, however, has produced individual super-Schottky diodes whose capacitance is decreased by over an order of magnitude. This reduction in capacitance implies that single mixer diodes will achieve a conversion loss of 7 dB, a mixer noise temperature of 6 K, and a video NEP of 5 \u00d7 10\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">-16</sup>\nW/Hz\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1/2</sup>\nat 30 GHz.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1060108/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1979","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1979","volume":"15","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","publicationDate":"January 1979","displayDocTitle":"The super-Schottky diode at 30 GHz","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The super-Schottky diode at 30 GHz","sourcePdf":"01060108.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.030695S","chronDate":"Jan 1979","isNumber":"22835","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"13","articleId":"1060108","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1979","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1060124,"authors":[{"name":"P.

Power signals are clipped on chip to the desired voltage supply level by series connected large area Josephson junctions (\"regulator\" junctions) and distributed across the chip by voltage busses. Supply resistors between the regulated voltage bus and the logic circuits define the operating current level. A detailed design is presented for a specific interferometer latching circuit family. We report experimental data on the two major components of the power system design - the regulators and the transformers. A series string of four regulator junctions provides a trapezoidal waveform of 11 mV amplitude at > 66% logic duty cycle (that portion of the machine cycle in which logic operations can be performed).

In this approximation, the switching delay is proportional to RC, where R = load resistance and C = device capacitance. However, we show here that the above approximation is quite incorrect in the technologically important case of logic interferometers in which resonances are suppressed by internal damping. We treat in detail the case of damped two-junction interferometers with step-function control current. Analysis of the equations of motion shows that in addition to the RC delay there is an initial turn-on delay during which the output voltage is very small, and which is most pronounced for heavy internal damping. It consists of the time required for the difference in phase between the two junctions to increase to a critical value, followed by approximately the first half-cycle of growth of the average of the junction phases. The turn-on delay is a strong function of overdrive, (i.e., the factor by which the control current amplitude exceeds threshold), being smallest at large overdrives, and scales as (C/i\n<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">0</inf>\n)\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1/2</sup>\n, where i\n<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">0</inf>\n= junction critical current.

A quantitative characterization and comparison are presented and individual transfer functions for ideal linear equalization are proposed. To remove the intersymbol interference, i.e., the linear portion of the distortion, from the playback signal of a high-density system, several cosine-power-law spectral candidates, with minimized noise enhancement and the capability of restoring amplitude loss and timing error, are explored. A unified relationship for the entire family of cosine-power-law spectral shapes and their bandwidth tradeoffs are identified, allowing for optimum read equalization at a tolerable signal-to-noise penalty. This is a useful tool for exploring practical density limitations of any given head/disk interface.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/20/22838/01060452.pdf","startPage":"1447","endPage":"1449","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","doi":"10.1109/TMAG.1979.1060452","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMAG.1979.1060452","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=22838","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1060452","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Characterization and spectral equalization for hight-density disk recording","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Disk recording","Bandwidth","Magnetic heads","Phase distortion","Time domain analysis","Transfer functions","Intersymbol interference","Noise shaping","Noise level","Signal restoration"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Magnetic disk recording"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1060452/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1979","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1979","displayDocTitle":"Characterization and spectral equalization for hight-density disk recording","volume":"15","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"November 1979","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Characterization and spectral equalization for hight-density disk recording","sourcePdf":"01060452.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.042137S","chronDate":"Nov 1979","isNumber":"22838","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"21","articleId":"1060452","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1979","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1060499,"authors":[{"name":"R.

As a consequence of an increased linear density with large intersymbol interference (ISI) and peak shifts, more sophisticated linear and nonlinear detection schemes will be necessary which take advantage of the correlation between the pulses. Besides equalization and decision feedback, the maximum-likelihood sequence estimation applied to pulse amplitude detection (PAM) [1] seems to give superior performance. As an alternative this paper will describe a Viterbi detector [2] working on pulse position data (PPM). This detector could be added to conventional implementations without redesigning the whole magnetic readback channel. Due to the nonlinearity of the PPM-channel and the fact that the restrictions of run-length-limited (RLL) codes [3] will be imbedded, the design and analysis will differ from known results.","doi":"10.1109/TMAG.1981.1061641","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/20/22850/01061641.pdf","startPage":"3337","endPage":"3339","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=22850","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMAG.1981.1061641","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1061641","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1981","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1981","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1061641/","displayDocTitle":"An event-driven maximum-likelihood peak position detector for run-length-limited codes in magnetic recording","volume":"17","issue":"6","publicationDate":"November 1981","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An event-driven maximum-likelihood peak position detector for run-length-limited codes in magnetic recording","sourcePdf":"01061641.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.026005S","chronDate":"Nov 1981","isNumber":"22850","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"6","articleId":"1061641","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1981","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":1061721,"authors":[{"name":"K.

The apparent value of this quantity is found to depend upon the time scale of interest. A method of measurement that observes changes of magnetization on a short time scale will yield a larger coercivity than one that measures changes over a longer time scale. The cause of this phenomenon is thermally assisted reversal of magnetic domains. Thus, for a magnetic recording material, the coercivity relevant to a high-speed writing process is greater than that relevant to transition broadening and long-term storage stability. The difference between the short-and long-term coercivities becomes more pronounced as the size of the magnetic switching unit becomes smaller. Therefore, these kinetic effects will become increasingly important in determining the ultimate limitations of future high-density media. Data are presented that illustrate the variation of coercivity with time scale in presently used and experimental recording materials.","doi":"10.1109/TMAG.1981.1061755","startPage":"3020","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/20/22850/01061755.pdf","endPage":"3022","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=22850","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMAG.1981.1061755","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1981","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1981","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1061755/","displayDocTitle":"Kinetic effects in coercivity measurements","volume":"17","issue":"6","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"November 1981","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Kinetic effects in coercivity measurements","sourcePdf":"01061755.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033082S","chronDate":"Nov 1981","isNumber":"22850","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"181","articleId":"1061755","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1981","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1061773,"authors":[{"name":"P.

The processes of calculation in these methods are contrary to the conventional technique. These new methods have the following advantages: (a) If there are many unknown independent magnetizing currents, these currents are directly calculated by the new method. (b) When a flux distribution is specified, the optimum shapes of the magnets can be directly calculated. (c) As these new methods need no repetition, computing time can be considerably reduced. The principles and the finite element formulations of these new methods are described, and a few examples of application of these methods are shown.

This method is effective for the design of magnetic circuits consisting of several permanent magnets and the determination of the shapes of magnets.","doi":"10.1109/TMAG.1982.1062099","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/20/22856/01062099.pdf","startPage":"1049","endPage":"1051","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMAG.1982.1062099","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=22856","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Application of the finite element method to the design of permanent magnets","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1062099","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1982","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1982","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1062099/","displayDocTitle":"Application of the finite element method to the design of permanent magnets","volume":"18","issue":"6","publicationDate":"November 1982","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Application of the finite element method to the design of permanent magnets","sourcePdf":"01062099.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033328S","chronDate":"Nov 1982","isNumber":"22856","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"10","articleId":"1062099","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1982","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1062139,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The first one, called the local jacobian derivative, may be used for evaluation of the derivative of any integral quantity versus the parameter of motion of a rigid body. Typically, this method when applied to electromagnetic systems, can be used for the computation of magnetic force or torque by virtual-work principle. Compared with the popular Maxwell's tensor method, this procedure is easier to implement in a finite element package especially for 3D problems. The second method which is based on a stationary property of the field solution, allows the evaluation of a second order derivative of any integral quantity. For instance, computation of the stiffness of a magnetic system (derivative of a force or a torque) may be achieved as the second order derivative of the magnetic energy. It may be pointed out that this method requires the field computation once for a linear problem as well as for a non-linear one.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A methodology for the determination of global electromechanical quantities from a finite element analysis and its application to the evaluation of magnetic forces, torques and stiffness","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","doi":"10.1109/TMAG.1983.1062812","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/20/22862/01062812.pdf","startPage":"2514","endPage":"2519","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMAG.1983.1062812","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=22862","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1062812","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1062812/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1983","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1983","displayDocTitle":"A methodology for the determination of global electromechanical quantities from a finite element analysis and its application to the evaluation of magnetic forces, torques and stiffness","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"19","issue":"6","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","publicationDate":"November 1983","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A methodology for the determination of global electromechanical quantities from a finite element analysis and its application to the evaluation of magnetic forces, torques and stiffness","sourcePdf":"01062812.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.035749S","chronDate":"Nov 1983","isNumber":"22862","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"250","articleId":"1062812","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1983","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1062816,"authors":[{"name":"M.

We confirmed the validity of this method by two dimensional calculations and developed a three dimensional calculation code MAX3D. Satisfactory results are obtained for rectangular cavities, cylindrical cavities and those cavities with smoothly deformed parts.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/20/22862/01062816.pdf","startPage":"2417","endPage":"2420","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","doi":"10.1109/TMAG.1983.1062816","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMAG.1983.1062816","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=22862","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1062816","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A three dimensional analysis of RF electromagnetic fields by the finite element method","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Electromagnetic analysis","Radio frequency","Electromagnetic fields","Finite element methods","Boundary conditions","Maxwell equations","Electromagnetic scattering","Electromagnetic waveguides","Partial differential equations","Shape"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Cavity resonators","Cylinders","FEM","Finite-element method (FEM)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1062816/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1983","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1983","displayDocTitle":"A three dimensional analysis of RF electromagnetic fields by the finite element method","volume":"19","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"November 1983","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A three dimensional analysis of RF electromagnetic fields by the finite element method","sourcePdf":"01062816.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.069705S","chronDate":"Nov 1983","isNumber":"22862","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"35","articleId":"1062816","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1983","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1062817,"authors":[{"name":"A.

In this paper, we describe a method of analysis on damper winding currents due to subharmonic m.m.f.'s by use of FEM. In general, the region for analyzing subharmonic m.m.f.'s is multi pole-pitches, while that for a fundamental or a harmonic m.m.f. is one pole-pitch. In this paper, we present a method for the analysis with the aid of the symmetrical co-ordinate method, in which the region for the subharmonic m.m.f. can become one pole-pitch.

By refining those elements having the largest errors and recomputing the solution iteractively, finite element meshes having a uniforrn error density are obtained. The system is menu oriented and utilizes multiple command and display windows to create and edit the object description interactively.

The design of the HSST-03 vehicle was conducted by the hands of Japan Air Lines and Sumitomo Electric Industries. The vehicle of the HSST-03 system is levitated by electromagnets and propelled by linear induction motors. It has a length of 13.8 m, a gross weight of 16 tons, and 47 seats for passengers. It is designed to serve as a means of passenger carriage in the Expo site. The vehicle assembly was completed in February, 1984, and the levitation test of the vehicle is under way. On the other hand, the track for the HSST-03, which has the length of about 350 m, is now under construction and will be completed by the end of June, 1984. The HSST-03 is characterized by the module system which has a LIM for propulsion and 4 magnets for levitation and guidance unitized in a box beam structure and will be applicable for high-speed operational vehicles in the future. We have already carried out preliminary experiments on the module system and other components, and obtained satisfactory results as expected earlier.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=22871","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMAG.1984.1063210","doi":"10.1109/TMAG.1984.1063210","startPage":"1675","endPage":"1677","pdfPath":"/iel5/20/22871/01063210.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1063210","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1984","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1984","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1063210/","displayDocTitle":"HSST-03 system","volume":"20","issue":"5","publicationDate":"September 1984","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","isJournal":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"HSST-03 system","sourcePdf":"01063210.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.023833S","chronDate":"Sep 1984","isNumber":"22871","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"21","articleId":"1063210","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1984","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1063232,"authors":[{"name":"J.

In the near future this test facility will show the economic feasibility of such a system. An essential component of this system is the magnetic levitation and guidance system of the vehicle. The requirements on this suspension system are: good ride comfort, high reliability and low operating costs. The elements of the suspension system are controlled cross field electromagnets with massive iron cores and rails for guidance and controlled longitudinal field magnets with a laminated iron core and rail for levitation. The reason for lamination is the combination of three operating tasks in the levitation magnets. These are: levitation, propulsion, and inductive power transfer to the vehicle. These magnets generate the exciting field of the synchronous linear motor. Due to these tasks the theoretical model for a levitation magnet has to be expanded in order to be able to describe these effects in dynamic simulations. The mechanical and the electrical structure of the suspension system must have several redundancies in order to get a high overall safety.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMAG.1984.1063246","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=22871","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/20/22871/01063246.pdf","endPage":"1671","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The electromagnetic levitation and guidance technology of the 'transrapid' test facility Emsland","doi":"10.1109/TMAG.1984.1063246","startPage":"1666","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1063246","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1984","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1984","displayDocTitle":"The electromagnetic levitation and guidance technology of the 'transrapid' test facility Emsland","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1063246/","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","publicationDate":"September 1984","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"20","issue":"5","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The electromagnetic levitation and guidance technology of the 'transrapid' test facility Emsland","sourcePdf":"01063246.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.023305S","chronDate":"Sep 1984","isNumber":"22871","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"51","articleId":"1063246","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1984","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-16"},{"_id":1063271,"authors":[{"name":"K.

The boundary condition of the plate conductor of arbitrary shape is satisfied directly by making use of the Fourier expansion collocation method. Numerical calculations have been carried out for the conductor of rectangular plates, circular plates with eccentric fluxes.

The optical system used, a colliding-pulse mode-locked laser, generated two 120 fs FWHM at 100 MHz. One pulse was used, via a photoconductive switch, to generate an electrical signal of adjustable height and width. The second pulse was used to detect the electrical transient by probing the change in the birefringence of a lithium tantalate crystal induced by the electrical signal. This optical sampling scheme had intrinsic temporal and voltage resolutions of < 500 fs and < 1 mV. In actual experiments, the connection-limited time resolution was 55 ps or 16 ps, depending on whether the detector was placed in room or cryogenic environment. The measured response of the tunnel junction was found to be consistent with the RSJ model.","doi":"10.1109/TMAG.1985.1063787","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMAG.1985.1063787","startPage":"230","endPage":"233","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/20/22874/01063787.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=22874","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An application of picosecond electro-optic sampling to superconducting electronics","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1985","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1985","displayDocTitle":"An application of picosecond electro-optic sampling to superconducting electronics","publicationDate":"March 1985","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","volume":"21","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1063787/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An application of picosecond electro-optic sampling to superconducting electronics","sourcePdf":"01063787.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.02485S","chronDate":"Mar 1985","isNumber":"22874","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"7","articleId":"1063787","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1985","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1063910,"authors":[{"name":"R.

The flux that passes through the rotor and stator core, the flux that flows through the interpolar air gap linking only the excited winding and the flux that links both the excited and the adjacent pole windings are clearly identified.

In both cases a combination with a scalar potential is necessary in the non conducting regions. In the case of A this leads to either a non symmetric or not positive definite system of equations to be solved. This is avoided by the formulation in H, but special elements have to be chosen in order to satisfy the interface conditions between the two regions. The construction of such elements on tetrahedra or rectangular blocks can be found in [4]. The construction for hexahedra, or more specifically, isoparametric bricks, is shown here. Compared to filling a hexahedron with tetrahedra, this method reduces the number of unknowns by a half.

The minute spacing between these surfaces (0.2 \u00b5M) permits the use of electrical capacitance for obtaining absolute flying height, pitch and roll of the slider relative to the disk surface. Employing special multi-sensor air bearing sliders in an assembled disk file, along with high bandwidth electronics and microsecond data acquisition, its motion can be captured and reconstructed. The results are visualized in a motion picture format, showing the behavior of the slider in slow motion during an entire full data band access stroke. No large excursions of the slider's motion are found even when it experiences a large radial acceleration during accessing.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Motion pictures","Data visualization","Actuators","Integral equations","Capacitance measurement","Acceleration","Lubricants","Coatings","Particle measurements","Disk recording"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Disk drives","Magnetic disk recording","Magnetic recording/reading heads","Motion measurements","Optical distance measurement"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1064505","doi":"10.1109/TMAG.1986.1064505","startPage":"1031","endPage":"1033","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/20/22883/01064505.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=22883","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMAG.1986.1064505","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1986","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1064505/","displayDocTitle":"Motion pictures on in-situ air bearing dynamics","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1986","volume":"22","issue":"5","publicationDate":"September 1986","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","isJournal":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Motion pictures on in-situ air bearing dynamics","sourcePdf":"01064505.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.020523S","chronDate":"Sep 1986","isNumber":"22883","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"11","articleId":"1064505","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1986","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1064518,"authors":[{"name":"H.C.

For calibration the algorithm requires data from only one flaw of known type (inclusion, crack), shape, and dimensions. The algorithm is based on least-squares techniques and is implemented using a modified algebraic reconstruction technique. The electromagnetic model system is an integral equation which is then discretized by means of the method of moments. The algebraic reconstruction algorithm, which is iterative, is applied to the discretized system. The algorithm utilizes a parameter for smoothing and a relaxation parameter to accelerate convergence.

Operating flexibility, ruggedness, size, force-to-weight ratio, and robust control capabilities are design attributes which place a heavy burden on conventional machines used for manipulation purposes. The spherical induction motor is an electromechanical drive which holds considerable promise in these application areas. A general analysis of both the fields and resultant forces generic to the spherical induction motor is presented. The analysis properly accounts for the diffusion of the magnetic field with changing frequency and motor speed. To aid in the prediction and conceptualization of the torque and commensurate motor losses, normalized plots of these parameters are given for various limiting values of skin depth ratio to conductor thickness. Results indicate that the device is capable of continuous speed control and efficient torque production.","doi":"10.1109/TMAG.1987.1064749","startPage":"273","endPage":"282","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/20/22885/01064749.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMAG.1987.1064749","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=22885","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The analysis of fields and torques in spherical induction motors","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Induction motors","Magnetic analysis","Robotics and automation","Manufacturing processes","Transducers","Robust control","Magnetic fields","Frequency","Torque","Skin"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Induction motors","Spheres"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1064749/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1987","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1987","displayDocTitle":"The analysis of fields and torques in spherical induction motors","volume":"23","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"January 1987","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The analysis of fields and torques in spherical induction motors","sourcePdf":"01064749.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.024362S","chronDate":"Jan 1987","isNumber":"22885","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"82","articleId":"1064749","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1987","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":1064829,"authors":[{"name":"A.

This behavior has been attributed to transition noise predominating over the more conventional amplitude modulation noise. At low recording densities the total noise power increases linearly with the transition density. At higher recording densities the noise increases more rapidly. The departure from the linear noise power increase with transition density has been attributed to correlation between noise in adjacent transitions. A model is presented for the noise process in longitudinal thin-film media, assuming that each transition's position fluctuation is correlated to the previous transition's position fluctuation by the demagnetization field. The dominant effect of the demagnetization fields is to increase the inherent noise in each transition and broaden the transitions as the recording density increases. It is the inherent noise increase in each transition, rather than the contribution from the adjacent transition correlation noise power term, that explains the experimentally found nonlinear noise power increase at higher transition densities. The frequency dependence of the integrated noise power is shown to be a strong function of the transition shape.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/20/22886/01065073.pdf","startPage":"1776","endPage":"1788","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","doi":"10.1109/TMAG.1987.1065073","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMAG.1987.1065073","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=22886","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1065073","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Transition noise model for longitudinal thin-film media","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Transistors","Jitter","Noise shaping","Frequency","Fluctuations","Magnetic noise","Demagnetization","Shape","Density measurement","Random media"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Magnetic recording noise"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1065073/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1987","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1987","displayDocTitle":"Transition noise model for longitudinal thin-film media","volume":"23","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 1987","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Transition noise model for longitudinal thin-film media","sourcePdf":"01065073.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047738S","chronDate":"Mar 1987","isNumber":"22886","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"44","articleId":"1065073","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1987","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1065093,"authors":[{"name":"L.

In this paper, a more general class of codes known as Mary (D,K) codes (D and K are matrices) is introduced. The capacities, or maximum rates, of these codes are derived. Next, some special cases of M-ary (D,K) codes are described and their capacities are calculated. Some specific codes are then generated using the sliding block code algorithm. Finally, a new ternary signaling scheme that uses ternary (D,K) constraints combined with write equalization is suggested for use on a magnetic recording channel.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/20/22889/01065196.pdf","startPage":"3678","endPage":"3680","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","doi":"10.1109/TMAG.1987.1065196","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMAG.1987.1065196","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=22889","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1065196","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Results involving (D,K) constrained M-ary codes","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Magnetic recording","Lifting equipment","Signal generators","Block codes","Difference equations","Transforms","Binary codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Coding/decoding","Magnetic recording"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1065196/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1987","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1987","displayDocTitle":"Results involving (D,K) constrained M-ary codes","volume":"23","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"September 1987","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Results involving (D,K) constrained M-ary codes","sourcePdf":"01065196.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037432S","chronDate":"Sep 1987","isNumber":"22889","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"26","articleId":"1065196","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1987","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1065230,"authors":[{"name":"H.

This paper presents a transition noise model for square wave recording on longitudinal thin film media considering two sources of noise: phase shift (or transition jitter) and amplitude. The transition jitter noise is due to random fluctuations in the transition positions, while the amplitude noise is due to random shape fluctuations in the transitions. It is assumed that random medium coercivity fluctuations cause transition position fluctuations. The random transition shape fluctuations are modeled by allowing the transition parameter\n<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">a</tex>\nto be a random variable.

Noise measurement techniques using power spectral density or RMS noise power inherently assume that all noise sources are stationary and, thus, cannot accurately predict the time-varying statistics of a non-stationary noise process. Studies have indicated that noise in metallic thin-film media is localized in the transition regions; hence, it is not a stationary process. Therefore, we have chosen to characterize media noise by direct time measurement of the readback voltage. In this paper we model thin metallic media noise by assuming that the magnetic transitions experience random variations in both position and width. A time measurement technique was employed to estimate the second order statistics of width and position of isolated readback pulses in 3 different samples of metallic thin-film media. The RMS noise estimated from the model and time measurements of the sample statistics accurately predicts the RMS noise measured by a spectrum analyzer, supporting the validity of the proposed model.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1065704/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1987","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1987","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","publicationDate":"September 1987","volume":"23","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Time measurements of amplitude and bit shift in thin metallic media","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Time measurements of amplitude and bit shift in thin metallic media","sourcePdf":"01065704.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.028113S","chronDate":"Sep 1987","isNumber":"22889","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"6","articleId":"1065704","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1987","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":1065746,"authors":[{"name":"O.

Recent models of erased noise involve clusters of interacting particles that could be as large as a few microns. As the trackwidth (TW) approaches the cluster size, the noise should become correlated across the track and the tape-noise-limited signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) should become constant as TW is further reduced. A check of this idea using inductive heads is impractical. Magnetoresistive (MR) heads have very high signal and low noise and so are well suited for this task, but precautions must be taken to minimize thermal and Barkhausen noise. A multichannel MR head having TW from 128 \u03bcM to 4 \u03bcM was built to explore the areal reproduce density limits of MR heads and measure the bulk-erased SNR versus TW for 3M 5198 tape. Tape-noise-limited performance was achieved with the narrowest 4\u03bcM TW channel at a wavelength as short as 1\u03bcM. A wideband-equalized SNR of 20 dB was demonstrated with this channel at a wavelength of 1.27 \u03bcm or 40 kilo flux changes per inch (40 kFCI), at a tape speed of 38.2 cm/sec. With a 100% guard band, or an 8-\u03bcm track-to-track pitch, this corresponds to the very high areal storage density of 127 MFC/in\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n.

The Andrews file system (AFS) and distributed file system (DFS), for example, can facilitate this sharing. In other sites, each server might have its own independent file system. Although scheduling algorithms for traditional distributed systems do not address the special needs of Web server clusters well, a significant evolution in the computational approach to artificial intelligence and cognitive engineering shows promise for Web request scheduling. Not only is this transformation - from discrete symbolic reasoning to massively parallel and connectionist neural modeling - of compelling scientific interest, but also of considerable practical value. Our novel application of connectionist neural modeling to map Web page requests to Web server caches maximizes hit ratio while load balancing among caches. In particular, we have developed a new learning algorithm for fast Web page allocation on a server using the self-organizing properties of the neural network (NN).","doi":"10.1109/MIC.2002.1067732","startPage":"18","endPage":"26","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Internet Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4236/22924/01067732.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Internet Computing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MIC.2002.1067732","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=22924","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Faster Web page allocation with neural networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Web pages","Neural networks","File systems","Network servers","File servers","Web server","Quality of service","Telecommunication traffic","Scheduling algorithm","Distributed computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["file servers","Web sites","self-organising feature maps","learning (artificial intelligence)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["self-organizing neural network","distributed Web server systems","Web content self-similarity","Web sites","shared file system","shared data space","Web request scheduling","massively parallel connectionist neural modeling","Web page requests","Web server caches","load balancing","hit ratio","learning algorithm","fast Web page allocation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1067732/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 December 2002","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.-Dec.  2002","displayDocTitle":"Faster Web page allocation with neural networks","volume":"6","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov.-Dec. 2002","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2002","accessionNumber":"7470641","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Faster Web page allocation with neural networks","sourcePdf":"01067732.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039804S","chronDate":"Nov.-Dec.  2002","isNumber":"22924","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4236","citationCount":"11","articleId":"1067732","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1067734,"authors":[{"name":"M.

QoS takes into account not only the average response time, but also the percentile of the response time; and throughput is the rate at which a service can process requests. QoS measures can include the maximum throughput or a function that describes how throughput varies with load intensity. The QoS measure is observed by Web services users.

QoS issues in Web services have to be evaluated from the perspective of the providers of Web services and from the perspective of the users of these services.","doi":"10.1109/MIC.2002.1067740","publicationTitle":"IEEE Internet Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Internet Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4236/22924/01067740.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MIC.2002.1067740","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=22924","startPage":"72","endPage":"75","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"QoS issues in Web services","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1067740","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"QoS issues in Web services","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov/Dec 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1067740/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 December 2002","isJournal":true,"volume":"6","issue":"6","publicationDate":"Nov.-Dec. 2002","accessionNumber":"7470648","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"QoS issues in Web services","sourcePdf":"01067740.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.052808S","chronDate":"Nov/Dec 2002","isNumber":"22924","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4236","citationCount":"550","articleId":"1067740","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1067750,"authors":[{"name":"Lin Xu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Tianjin University, TJU, Tianjin, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8110/22495/1067750/1067750-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Lin Xu was born in Hebei Province, China, on March 11, 1978.

In order to overcome the demerit of overlong training time and slow convergence rate of the BP algorithm, an improved BP algorithm, \"learning rate self-adaptive adjusting method based on constant error correction rate\", is put forward, with which the network training efficiency can be greatly improved. Besides the ANN structure and its training algorithm, another important factor to realize fault diagnosis with neural network is the fault symptom calculation. The calculating methods for different fault symptoms are discussed in detail. Finally, the high-pressure feed-water heater system of a 300 MW thermal power generating unit is taken as an example of fault diagnosis.

The necessary increase in system capacity requires that a new multiple-access technique be employed. A possible solution to this problem is code-division multiple access (CDMA). The application of CDMA to the air traffic system closely parallels the cellular phone industry's use of CDMA. However, due to the high mobility of the users in the air traffic system, a different receiver structure could significantly improve performance.

We cast the problem in a probabilistic game theoretical framework, and consider two computationally feasible greedy pursuit policies: local-mar and global-max. To implement this scenario on real UAVs and UGVs, we propose a distributed hierarchical hybrid system architecture which emphasizes the autonomy of each agent, yet allows for coordinated team efforts. We describe the implementation of the architecture on a fleet of UAVs and UGVs, detailing components such as high-level pursuit policy computation, map building and interagent communication, and low-level navigation, sensing, and control. We present both simulation and experimental results of real pursuit-evasion games involving our fleet of UAVs and UGVs, and evaluate the pursuit policies relating expected capture times to the speed and intelligence of the evaders and the sensing capabilities of the pursuers.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1067989/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 December 2002","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 2002","publicationDate":"Oct. 2002","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1067989/","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2002","accessionNumber":"7472236","volume":"18","issue":"5","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Probabilistic pursuit-evasion games: theory, implementation, and experimental evaluation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Probabilistic pursuit-evasion games: theory, implementation, and experimental evaluation","sourcePdf":"01067989.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.090148S","chronDate":"Oct 2002","xplore-pub-id":"70","isNumber":"22928","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"70","citationCount":"319","xplore-issue":"22928","articleId":"1067989","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1067990,"authors":[{"name":"T.

In this paper, we develop and analyze a probabilistic, vision-based state estimation method for individual autonomous robots. This method enables a team of mobile robots to estimate their joint positions in a known environment and track the positions of autonomously moving objects. The state estimators of different robots cooperate to increase the accuracy and reliability of the estimation process. This cooperation between the robots enables them to track temporarily occluded objects and to faster recover their position after they have lost track of it. The method is empirically validated based on experiments with a team of physical robots.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["State estimation","Mobile robots","Robot sensing systems","Robot vision systems","Robotics and automation","Maintenance","Multirobot systems","Uncertainty","Working environment noise","Actuators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mobile robots","state estimation","cooperative systems","tracking","robot vision","position control","sensor fusion","path planning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiple-hypothesis tracking","multiple robot systems","multisensor fusion","robot soccer","uncertainty propagation","vision-based localization","probabilistic state estimation","cooperative system","mobile robots"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TRA.2002.804499","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics and Automation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel5/70/22928/01067990.pdf","startPage":"670","endPage":"684","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=22928","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TRA.2002.804499","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cooperative probabilistic state estimation for vision-based autonomous mobile robots","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1067990","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Cooperative probabilistic state estimation for vision-based autonomous mobile robots","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1067990/","volume":"18","issue":"5","publicationDate":"Oct. 2002","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1067990/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"7472237","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 2002","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 December 2002","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cooperative probabilistic state estimation for vision-based autonomous mobile robots","sourcePdf":"01067990.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.10727S","chronDate":"Oct 2002","xplore-pub-id":"70","isNumber":"22928","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"70","citationCount":"65","xplore-issue":"22928","articleId":"1067990","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1067991,"authors":[{"name":"T.

Inspired by the biological concept of hormone, the paper develops the adaptive communication (AC) protocol that enables modules continuously to discover changes in their local topology, and the adaptive distributed control (ADC) protocol that allows modules to use hormone-like messages in collaborating their actions to accomplish locomotion and self-reconfiguration. These protocols are implemented and evaluated, and experiments in the CONRO self-reconfigurable robot and in a Newtonian simulation environment have shown that the protocols are robust and scaleable when configurations change dynamically and unexpectedly, and they can support online reconfiguration, module-level behavior shifting, and locomotion.

Each of the robots collects sensor data regarding its own motion and shares this information with the rest of the team during the update cycles. A single estimator, in the form of a Kalman filter, processes the available positioning information from all the members of the team and produces a pose estimate for every one of them. The equations for this centralized estimator can be written in a decentralized form, therefore allowing this single Kalman filter to be decomposed into a number of smaller communicating filters. Each of these filters processes the sensor data collected by its host robot. Exchange of information between the individual filters is necessary only when two robots detect each other and measure their relative pose. The resulting decentralized estimation schema, which we call collective localization, constitutes a unique means for fusing measurements collected from a variety of sensors with minimal communication and processing requirements. The distributed localization algorithm is applied to a group of three robots and the improvement in localization accuracy is presented. Finally, a comparison to the equivalent decentralized information filter is provided.","doi":"10.1109/TRA.2002.803461","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TRA.2002.803461","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics and Automation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel5/70/22928/01067998.pdf","startPage":"781","endPage":"795","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=22928","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed multirobot localization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1067998/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 2002","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 December 2002","displayDocTitle":"Distributed multirobot localization","volume":"18","issue":"5","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2002","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2002","accessionNumber":"7472245","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1067998/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed multirobot localization","sourcePdf":"01067998.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.077064S","chronDate":"Oct 2002","xplore-pub-id":"70","isNumber":"22928","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"70","citationCount":"482","xplore-issue":"22928","articleId":"1067998","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1068000,"authors":[{"name":"A.K.

Models of cooperation are discussed and related to the input/output reachability, structural observability, and controllability of the entire system. Whereas decentralized control research in the past has concentrated on using decentralized controllers to partition complex physically interconnected systems, this work uses decentralized methods to connect otherwise independent nontouching robotic vehicles so that they behave in a stable, coordinated fashion. A vector Liapunov method is used to prove stability of two examples: the controlled motion of multiple vehicles along a line and the controlled motion of multiple vehicles in formation. Also presented are three applications of this theory: controlling a formation, guarding a perimeter, and surrounding a facility.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TRA.2002.803466","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=22928","startPage":"852","endPage":"864","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel5/70/22928/01068004.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Decentralized control of cooperative robotic vehicles: theory and application","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1068004/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 2002","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 December 2002","htmlLink":"/document/1068004/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Decentralized control of cooperative robotic vehicles: theory and application","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2002","accessionNumber":"7472249","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"18","issue":"5","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Decentralized control of cooperative robotic vehicles: theory and application","sourcePdf":"01068004.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.090091S","chronDate":"Oct 2002","xplore-pub-id":"70","isNumber":"22928","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"70","citationCount":"175","xplore-issue":"22928","articleId":"1068004","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1068061,"authors":[{"name":"J.

In this scheme the nonlinear index of refraction (n\n<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</inf>\n) of the glass in the amplifier impresses a frequency sweep or \"chirp\" on the pulse. Further analysis is presented here. The stability to amplitude noise is demonstrated. We calculate that impressed periodic amplitude modulation is responsible for the growth of distinct spectral sidebands in the nonlinear host glass, and we find that the compressor converts these sidebands into temporal features which precede and follow the central compressed pulse. When a pulse with 10-percent peak-to-peak impressed periodic modulation passes through a sufficient length of glass so that the peak nonlinear phase is approximately 4\u03c0, these precursors are only about 1/20th the intensity of the main compressed pulse. RMS equivalent random noise has a flat sideband spectrum, and the precursors are found to be absent in the compressed pulses. The intensity averaging over possible transverse-mode structures is studied for some axially symmetric spatial mode shapes. This averaging somewhat reduces the compression ratio from the estimates in which the transverse modes were flat-topped. Finally, arguments are presented to explain why it is felt that a grating pair is not likely to be a suitable compressor for such intense nanosecond-duration pulses.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1068512/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1975","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1975","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","publicationDate":"January 1975","volume":"11","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Pulse compression for more efficient operation of solid-state laser amplifier chains II","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Pulse compression for more efficient operation of solid-state laser amplifier chains II","sourcePdf":"01068512.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.027034S","chronDate":"Jan 1975","isNumber":"22941","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3","citationCount":"10","articleId":"1068512","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1975","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":1068539,"authors":[{"name":"W.

The equations are solved numerically for a variety of practical situations, and analytical approximations for some limiting cases are discussed. The results describe the dependence of the amplified-spontaneous-emission (ASE) output flux on pumping rate, the spectral narrowing process, and the effects of gain saturation. It is found that under practical laboratory conditions the gain of such dye systems saturates rapidly. Consequently, at high pumping rates the output varies linearly with pump intensity, and the conversion efficiency from pump to ASE photons approaches unity. The performance of dyedaser amplifiers is described by the same set of equations, and the gain characteristics of such systems are analyzed as a function of input signal intensity and pumping rate. The theoretical calculations are compared with the results of a set of experiments, and good agreement is found. The operation characteristics of a dye-laser amplifier are evaluated and utilized in the design of a narrow-band oscillator-amplifier system.","doi":"10.1109/JQE.1975.1068543","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JQE.1975.1068543","startPage":"881","endPage":"892","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/3/22943/01068543.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=22943","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Amplified spontaneous emission and signal amplification in dye-laser systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"November  1975","chronOrPublicationDate":"November  1975","displayDocTitle":"Amplified spontaneous emission and signal amplification in dye-laser systems","publicationDate":"November 1975","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","volume":"11","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1068543/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Amplified spontaneous emission and signal amplification in dye-laser systems","sourcePdf":"01068543.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.052306S","chronDate":"November  1975","isNumber":"22943","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3","citationCount":"156","articleId":"1068543","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1975","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1068557,"authors":[{"name":"M.

In the coordinate plane, whose abscissa is proportional to the small-signal saturable absorber loading, and whose ordinate is proportional to the small-signal gain, the following regimes are laid out: 1) steady-state single-pulse mode-locking solutions; 2) stability against relaxation oscillations; 3) self-starting of mode locking. The assumption is made that CW mode locking can be obtained only for a choice of parameters for which all three regimes overlap. We require further that the overlap regime be reached by a monotonic increase of small-signal gain (pumping), without passing outside regime 2). Under these conditions one may state requirements on the system parameters for the obtainment of single-pulse mode locking by a saturable absorber. The analysis explains why it has been impossible to mode lock passively the CW Nd:YAG laser, but passive mode locking of the CW dye-laser system is possible.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/3/22958/01069112.pdf","startPage":"169","endPage":"176","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","doi":"10.1109/JQE.1976.1069112","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JQE.1976.1069112","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=22958","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1069112","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Parameter ranges for CW passive mode locking","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Laser mode locking","Steady-state","Stability","Laser theory","Pump lasers","Laser excitation","Frequency","Bridges","Power lasers"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1069112/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1976","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1976","displayDocTitle":"Parameter ranges for CW passive mode locking","volume":"12","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 1976","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Parameter ranges for CW passive mode locking","sourcePdf":"01069112.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.022323S","chronDate":"Mar 1976","isNumber":"22958","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3","citationCount":"161","articleId":"1069112","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1976","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1069175,"authors":[{"name":"W.

A general formulation is developed for arbitrary-shaped gratings which need not be small in size. Two methods are used to solve the resulting equations in the case of rectangular-shaped gratings. The first is a perturbation technique and the second is iterative in nature. The iterative procedure converges to a numerical exact solution in many cases of practical interest and indicates that the perturbation results are quite accurate. Curves are presented for radiated power from traveling waves as a function of grating tooth height, tooth width, refractive index, waveguide thickness, and period for rectangular gratings in heterostructure waveguiding geometries. It is shown that radiation is not a monotonically increasing function of tooth height, but rather maxima occur when the teeth are half the optical wavelength in the material.

This general formulation takes into account the joint interaction of the two coherent contradirectional guided waves with arbitrarily shaped gratings. In addition to the modified coupled mode equations, which contain added constants characterizing the interactions, expressions for radiated waves are also obtained. A particular waveguide geometry is studied in detail. The interaction constants are evaluated for all Bragg orders up to the fourth and various blazing angles. Then the equations are solved for both a DBR and DFB laser. In the former case it is shown that the reflection is smaller than that computed without the interaction constants. Furthermore, reflection is asymmetrical relative to the Bragg condition. The DFB laser is shown to have an asymmetrical longitudinal mode structure even for symmetrical boundary conditions and to have only slightly higher thresholds than previously calculated.","doi":"10.1109/JQE.1977.1069328","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/3/7801355/01069328.pdf","startPage":"134","endPage":"141","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JQE.1977.1069328","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7801355","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Coupled wave analysis of DFB and DBR lasers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1069328","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April  1977","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  1977","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1069328/","displayDocTitle":"Coupled wave analysis of DFB and DBR lasers","volume":"13","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 1977","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Coupled wave analysis of DFB and DBR lasers","sourcePdf":"01069328.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033348S","chronDate":"April  1977","isNumber":"7801355","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3","citationCount":"167","articleId":"1069328","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1977","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":1069334,"authors":[{"name":"T.

The characteristics selected for investigation are relevant to the operation of the laser in an optical communication system and include the current dependence of the lasing emission and the orthogonally polarized (nonlasing) emission, the symmetry of the emission with respect to the two output faces, the time stability of the light intensity, and the frequency of the internal laser resonance. In spite of the variability among the aging behaviors of individual lasers, characteristic changes did emerge as statistically significant. For example, a substantial decrease in the emission symmetry was commonly observed. A second important effect was the creation of a self-induced intensity pulsation, at a frequency typically between 300 and 600 MHz, in lasers which initially exhibited no intensity modulation. A statistical analysis of the data was made to correlate these instabilities with asymmetries in the lasing or nonlasing emission and/or changes in the emission symmetry. No evidence was found to support previously published conjectures that the pulsations are caused by the formation of dark-line defects or by axial nonuniformities in the pumping current.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/3/22972/01069334.pdf","startPage":"351","endPage":"359","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","doi":"10.1109/JQE.1977.1069334","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JQE.1977.1069334","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=22972","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1069334","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Changes in the optical properties of CW (AlGa)As junction lasers during accelerated aging","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Laser transitions","Accelerated aging","Laser stability","Optical pumping","Frequency","Stimulated emission","Optical fiber communication","Optical polarization","Resonance","Intensity modulation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1069334/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1977","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1977","displayDocTitle":"Changes in the optical properties of CW (AlGa)As junction lasers during accelerated aging","volume":"13","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 1977","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Changes in the optical properties of CW (AlGa)As junction lasers during accelerated aging","sourcePdf":"01069334.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.075521S","chronDate":"May 1977","isNumber":"22972","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3","citationCount":"103","articleId":"1069334","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1977","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1069347,"authors":[{"name":"J.

The optical wave of narrow-stripe lasers is guided by the previously reported gain-guiding mechanism. The optical wave of wide-stripe lasers is found to be guided by changes in the real part of the dielectric constant that are caused by a dip in carrier concentration along the axis of the lasing filament. This self-focused guiding has been predicted theoretically. These experimental results strongly support the hypothesis that in all cases the waveguides are formed predominantly by the naturally occurring variations in carrier concentration beneath the stripe. A new and fairly comprehensive mathematical model has been developed based on this assumption. The model predicts the carrier concentration, resultant gain, and dielectric constant profiles together with the optical-beam parameters and light/current characteristics of stripe-geometry lasers. The model is applicable over a wide range of stripe widths and device structures.

In addition, experimental results about the noise characteristics for the lasers directly modulated are discussed in relation to the lasing-spectrum broadening. The total intensity output can be well stabilized at currents above threshold by larger than 10 percent, even when the same laser is modulated by large pulse currents at such high speeds as 400 Mbits. However, the relative noise power for each mode is about 30 dB larger than that for total modes within the whole frequency region observed in this work, and the noise spectrum becomes essentially flat when the laser is modulated. The relative fluctuations for each mode of the modulated laser seems to be nearly equal to the low-frequency fluctuations in each mode without modulation for a given normalized pump rate.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1069420/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1977","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1977","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","publicationDate":"August 1977","volume":"13","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Intensity fluctuations in each longitudinal mode of a multimode AlGaAs laser","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Intensity fluctuations in each longitudinal mode of a multimode AlGaAs laser","sourcePdf":"01069420.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037185S","chronDate":"Aug 1977","isNumber":"22975","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3","citationCount":"81","articleId":"1069420","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1977","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":1069640,"authors":[{"name":"A.

For off resonant pumping, Fabry-Perot interfetometer scans indicate a shift in emission frequency between high- and low-pressure laser operation. In high-pressure operation, emission occurs via a Raman type, two-photon process with some additional frequency offset due to the ac Stark effect. The Raman process is favored by its higher quantum efficiency over a two-step process involving single-photon transitions at the pump and SMM wavelengths. In low-pressure operation, the SMM laser emission is found to be delayed in time with respect to the pump pulse. The Raman process thus cannot occur and the two-step process is favored. This results in a shift in the SMM laser emission frequency from the Raman line to the line center frequency of the SMM laser transition. The Raman emission gain bandwidth appears to be broadened by the CO\n<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</inf>\npump laser bandwidth.","doi":"10.1109/JQE.1978.1069673","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/3/22977/01069673.pdf","startPage":"23","endPage":"30","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JQE.1978.1069673","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=22977","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Two-photon transitions in optically pumped submillimeter lasers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1069673","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1978","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1978","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1069673/","displayDocTitle":"Two-photon transitions in optically pumped submillimeter lasers","volume":"14","issue":"1","publicationDate":"January 1978","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Two-photon transitions in optically pumped submillimeter lasers","sourcePdf":"01069673.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.029235S","chronDate":"Jan 1978","isNumber":"22977","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3","citationCount":"58","articleId":"1069673","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1978","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1069682,"authors":[{"name":"D.

It was found that the optimum heating temperature for low loss splices is near 2000\u00b0C at 8.5 W electric discharge power. Splicing loss causes are examined.

The result represents a unification of the concepts used to describe these \"classical\" resistive mixers with the language of photon detection. Tunneling devices are predicted to undergo a transition from energy detectors to photon counters when operated at frequencies where the photon energy becomes comparable to the voltage scale of the dc nonlinearity. The small-signal video current response is found to approach one electron for each photon absorbed at high frequencies. In a heterodyne receiver, sufficiently nonlinear tunnel junctions are predicted to be capable of achieving the fundamental quantum noise limit for sensitivity in the detection of electromagnetic radiation. The theory presented here thus provides a framework for systematically extending the techniques of quantum electronics to considerably lower frequencies than are currently being exploited. Recent measurements of heterodyne mixer performance using superconductive tunneling devices are already beginning to approach quantum limited results at microwave and millimeter wave frequencies. Eventual application of tunnel barriers as photon detectors in the submillimeter and infrared spectral regions also appears to be possible, and the fast response times of such devices could give them an advantage over photoconductors even at the higher frequencies. The development of suitable nonlinear tunnel junctions contains the potential to bridge the present gap in quantum detectors between the infrared photon devices and microwave masers.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/3/22991/01069931.pdf","startPage":"1234","endPage":"1258","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","doi":"10.1109/JQE.1979.1069931","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JQE.1979.1069931","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=22991","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1069931","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Quantum limited detection in tunnel junction mixers","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Frequency","Infrared detectors","Superconducting microwave devices","Quantum mechanics","Tunneling","Radiation detectors","Millimeter wave measurements","Microwave theory and techniques","Voltage","Electrons"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Optical mixers","Photodetectors","Tunnel devices/effects"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1069931/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1979","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1979","displayDocTitle":"Quantum limited detection in tunnel junction mixers","volume":"15","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"November 1979","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Quantum limited detection in tunnel junction mixers","sourcePdf":"01069931.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.05703S","chronDate":"Nov 1979","isNumber":"22991","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3","citationCount":"409","articleId":"1069931","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1979","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-30"},{"_id":1069973,"authors":[{"name":"D.

This simple anisotropic waveguide has interesting properties. It supports only hybrid modes but in the limit of propagation along the optical axis and at right angles to it the modes become almost of the TE and TM type. Moreover, some of the modes become leaky waves as they propagate at increasingly larger angles relative to the optical axis of the dielectric material.

This kind of noise has caused serious problems for reliable optical communications, especially for analog-modulation systems. It is shown that there are two different phenomena which generate such noise. One of them is the double cavity state, and the other is the external light injection state. The cause of our noise considered in the double cavity state is the phase variation due to the variation of the equivalent length between the laser and the reflection point generated by mechanical vibrations. On the other hand, the cause in the external light injection state is the random generations of locking and unlocking states due to the frequency variation (or mode jumping) caused by the variation of the internal temperature of the laser diode. We conclude from our theory that an effective method to reduce such noise is to operate the laser diode at well above the threshold current. The complete elimination will be attained by use of the optical isolator inserted between the laser diode and the transmission lines.","doi":"10.1109/JQE.1979.1069975","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=22994","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JQE.1979.1069975","endPage":"149","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/3/22994/01069975.pdf","startPage":"142","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Noise properties of injection lasers due to reflected waves","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1979","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1979","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1069975/","displayDocTitle":"Noise properties of injection lasers due to reflected waves","volume":"15","issue":"3","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","publicationDate":"March 1979","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Noise properties of injection lasers due to reflected waves","sourcePdf":"01069975.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.026283S","chronDate":"Mar 1979","isNumber":"22994","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3","citationCount":"129","articleId":"1069975","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1979","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1069987,"authors":[{"name":"H.
