If the phase noise of two oscillators is measured using two of these test systems, the output noise of the equipment is uncorrelated except for the component that is due to the phase noise between the oscillators. Examination of a system which uses matched power splitters, two phase detectors, and post amplifiers reveals that an exceptionally low noise floor is achievable. The time required to reach a given percentage of precision in the measurement at these low noise floors is lengthened due to the need to average away the uncorrelated noise. The details of the setup, including calibration procedures and confidence intervals for the measurement, are discussed.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cross-correlation phase noise measurements","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 1992 IEEE Frequency Control Symposium","doi":"10.1109/FREQ.1992.270007","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 1992 IEEE Frequency Control Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel2/613/6712/00270007.pdf","startPage":"257","endPage":"261","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FREQ.1992.270007","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6712","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=270007","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/270007/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 May 1992","displayDocTitle":"Cross-correlation phase noise measurements","conferenceDate":"27-29 May 1992","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1992","accessionNumber":"4589998","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cross-correlation phase noise measurements","confLoc":"Hershey, PA, USA","sourcePdf":"00270007.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.027552S","chronDate":"27-29 May 1992","isNumber":"6712","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"613","citationCount":"92","articleId":"270007","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":270016,"authors":[{"name":"D.G.

The first stage contains a constant velocity motion model and produces the target position and velocity estimates, while the second stage provides estimates of the target acceleration. When a maneuver is detected, the acceleration estimate of the second stage is used to correct the estimates of the first stage. In order to overcome the requirement for explicit maneuver detection in the two-stage estimator, the interacting acceleration compensation (IAC) algorithm is proposed. In the IAC algorithm, the two-stage estimator is viewed as having two acceleration models. The first model corresponds to the zero acceleration of the constant velocity model, while the second model is a constant acceleration model. Simulation results indicate that the tracking performance of the IAC algorithm approaches that of an interacting multiple model (IMM) algorithm with a constant velocity model and constant acceleration model, while requiring approximately 50% of the computations of the IMM algorithm.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/270450/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1993","conferenceDate":"20-22 April 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4595917","displayDocTitle":"Interacting acceleration compensation algorithm for tracking maneuvering targets","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Interacting acceleration compensation algorithm for tracking maneuvering targets","confLoc":"Lynnfield, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"00270450.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.02993S","chronDate":"1993","isNumber":"6716","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"689","citationCount":"2","articleId":"270450","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":270461,"authors":[{"name":"R.

Since the phase noise is a stochastic process, the problem is defined in a stochastic processes context and a reasonable set of assumptions is imposed to produce a general, straightforward and easily understandable solution. The solution clearly indicates how the natural spectrum of the scatterer, the phase noise spectrum, and range correlation combine to produce the intermediate frequency spectrum.

The problem of lightly dampled oscillations on power systems is of interest to utilities in Canada and the US since interarea oscillations in some regions have meant derated power transfer on large interconnecting transmission lines. Simulation studies, eigenvalue analysis and state-space techniques, on-site transfer function measurement and controller design, and other analysis and design approaches have been applied in various approaches to designing power system stabilizers (PSSs) to damp these oscillations. One of the difficulties in designing and testing control strategies for damping interarea oscillations is measuring the relative interarea damping contribution from the control strategy being tested at a particular generator. Factors contributing to negative damping are reviewed, along with power system stabilizer tuning strategies. One approach to assessing damping contributions from PSSs during on-site testing is outlined.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power measurement","Damping","Power system measurements","Power system interconnection","Power system simulation","Testing","Power system analysis computing","Power markets","Measurement techniques","Power transmission lines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["damping","eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","oscillations","power system interconnection","power system stability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["steam units","inter-area damping contributions","power system stabilizers","interarea oscillations","power pools","hydro units","Canada","US","derated power transfer","eigenvalue analysis","state-space techniques","on-site transfer function measurement","controller design","negative damping","on-site testing"]}],"doi":"10.1109/WESCAN.1993.270581","publicationTitle":"IEEE WESCANEX 93 Communications, Computers and Power in the Modern Environment - Conference Proceedings","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE WESCANEX 93 Communications, Computers and Power in the Modern Environment - Conference Proceedings","pdfPath":"/iel2/702/6717/00270581.pdf","startPage":"234","endPage":"239","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6717","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WESCAN.1993.270581","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A technique for measuring inter-area damping contributions from power system stabilizers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=270581","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A technique for measuring inter-area damping contributions from power system stabilizers","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/270581/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1993","accessionNumber":"4618011","conferenceDate":"17-18 May 1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"1993","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A technique for measuring inter-area damping contributions from power system stabilizers","confLoc":"Saskatoon, SK, Canada","sourcePdf":"00270581.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.036907S","chronDate":"1993","isNumber":"6717","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"702","citationCount":"1","articleId":"270581","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":270582,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

The issues of protein energy functions, search algorithms, and folding pathways are discussed. The authors review the current approaches to the protein folding problem, point out the limitations of the approaches, and present the genetic algorithm method, which is based on viewing evolution as an optimization process. The schemata theorem is proved in the context of protein structure, showing that during a genetic algorithm search more and more attention will be given to favorable local structures while unfavorable local structures will be rapidly abandoned. It is shown that genetic algorithms are a suitable tool in protein structure predictions. A version of the genetic algorithm is presented that is suitable for protein structure prediction. The behavior of the algorithm is explored in a single model of folding, and it is shown that the algorithm behaves as expected and is able to find the correct conformation.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/HICSS.1993.270669","publicationTitle":"[1993] Proceedings of the Twenty-sixth Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences","displayPublicationTitle":"[1993] Proceedings of the Twenty-sixth Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences","pdfPath":"/iel5/449/6718/00270669.pdf","startPage":"715","endPage":"725 vol.1","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HICSS.1993.270669","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6718","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the applicability of genetic algorithms to protein folding","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=270669","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 Jan 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/270669/","displayDocTitle":"On the applicability of genetic algorithms to protein folding","volume":"i","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1993","accessionNumber":"4607297","conferenceDate":"8-8 Jan. 1993","dateOfInsertion":"09 July 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the applicability of genetic algorithms to protein folding","confLoc":"Wailea, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"00270669.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073917S","chronDate":"5-8 Jan 1993","isNumber":"6718","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"449","citationCount":"27","articleId":"270669","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":270747,"authors":[{"name":"A.K.W.

This may cut disk performance in half. To avoid this degradation, all of the lost data must be rebuilt and written to a spare disk. The faster the data are rebuilt, the sooner the disk array returns to normal operation. Giving high priority to the rebuild process, however, can increase response times for incoming application requests which complete for disk service. A balance must be found between acceptable application response times and disk rebuild times. Simulation was used to evaluate the effect of the rebuild unit size on response time and rebuild time. The authors have found this tradeoff to be embodied in the choice of the rebuild unit and the amount of rebuild data which is atomically read from each surviving disk. The find that a single track rebuild unit provides faster rebuild times than a one sector rebuild unit. Rebuilding one track at a time provides better application request response times when compared with rebuilding one cylinder at a time.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HICSS.1993.270756","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6718","startPage":"70","endPage":"79 vol.1","displayPublicationTitle":"[1993] Proceedings of the Twenty-sixth Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences","pdfPath":"/iel5/449/6718/00270756.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Balancing I/O response time and disk rebuild time in a RAID5 disk array","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/270756/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 Jan 1993","displayDocTitle":"Balancing I/O response time and disk rebuild time in a RAID5 disk array","conferenceDate":"8-8 Jan. 1993","publicationDate":"1993","accessionNumber":"4602105","dateOfInsertion":"09 July 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"i","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Balancing I/O response time and disk rebuild time in a RAID5 disk array","confLoc":"Wailea, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"00270756.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063662S","chronDate":"5-8 Jan 1993","isNumber":"6718","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"449","citationCount":"21","articleId":"270756","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":271024,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

A slip power recovery system with a doubly excited wound rotor induction machine is attractive in this situation. Field orientation control for doubly excited induction machines is studied. Since the operational condition and control objectives of the variable-speed constant-frequency generating system are significantly different from those of a variable-speed drive system, the implementation strategy of field orientation control of induction machines must be reexamined. A stator field orientation control method suitable for the doubly excited induction machine in a wind power generating system is developed. Digital simulation was carried out showing that the doubly excited induction generator with the proposed control strategy can track the optimal torque-speed profile of a wind turbine very well. In addition, flexible reactive power control was also accomplished.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/MWSCAS.1992.271024","publicationTitle":"[1992] Proceedings of the 35th Midwest Symposium on Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"[1992] Proceedings of the 35th Midwest Symposium on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel2/622/6719/00271024.pdf","startPage":"1446","endPage":"1449 vol.2","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWSCAS.1992.271024","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6719","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Stator field oriented control of doubly-excited induction machine in wind power generating system","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=271024","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-12 Aug 1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/271024/","displayDocTitle":"Stator field oriented control of doubly-excited induction machine in wind power generating system","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1992","accessionNumber":"4590087","conferenceDate":"9-12 Aug. 1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Stator field oriented control of doubly-excited induction machine in wind power generating system","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"00271024.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.029621S","chronDate":"9-12 Aug 1992","isNumber":"6719","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"622","citationCount":"20","articleId":"271024","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":271038,"authors":[{"name":"S.

Monolithic microwave integrated circuit (MMIC) power amplifiers use large periphery output devices to meet their output power goals. Bandwidth and impedance matching considerations typically require that the large output device be subdivided into smaller devices and power combined on-chip. This power combining introduces n possible modes of oscillation when n devices are combined. The usual stability analyses only address one mode. The author presents an approach for predicting and stabilizing oscillations for all n modes. Specific cases for n=2, 3 and 4 are discussed.

Three typical structures, including output, input, and the learning model, are discussed. Their NN designs are accompanied by the corresponding lookup table technology.

Regions free of overflow limit cycles using two's complement arithmetic are obtained in both parameter space and in the z-domain for SLA filters. Results for zero-input quantization limit cycle stability using two's complement truncation and rounding are extended to direct form (DF) SLA filters. Combining these results. the region of global asymptotic stability from zero-input limit cycles of DF SLA filters is found. In consequence, the DF SLA structure is proved to have merits implementing high Q filters except at certain regions near the unit circle, where the structure is highly susceptible to roundoff noise and coefficient quantization noise. DF and minimum roundoff noise based structures are compared for the purpose of reducing complexity or improving numerical performance.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6719","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWSCAS.1992.271172","publicationTitle":"[1992] Proceedings of the 35th Midwest Symposium on Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"[1992] Proceedings of the 35th Midwest Symposium on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel2/622/6719/00271172.pdf","startPage":"1128","endPage":"1131 vol.2","doi":"10.1109/MWSCAS.1992.271172","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Limit cycles in state-space pipelined scattered look-ahead filters","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-12 Aug 1992","displayDocTitle":"Limit cycles in state-space pipelined scattered look-ahead filters","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"9-12 Aug. 1992","publicationDate":"1992","accessionNumber":"4575354","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/271172/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Limit cycles in state-space pipelined scattered look-ahead filters","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"00271172.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052903S","chronDate":"9-12 Aug 1992","isNumber":"6719","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"622","citationCount":"3","articleId":"271172","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":271174,"authors":[{"name":"W.T.

The op amp has a 3.0-mm/sup 2/ area. The layout and fabrication are described. The design requirements of the op amp included low power consumption, low input offset voltage, a gain-bandwidth product of at least 250 kHz, a 1/f noise corner of 100 Hz or lower, a midband equivalent input noise voltage of 10 nV/ square root Hz or less, and operation at +or-2.5 V. The primary design requirement of the low frequency amplifier (LFA) was the minimization of the equivalent input noise of the op amp, especially the 1/f noise at frequencies between 100 Hz and 10 kHz. One useful means of evaluating the performance of the LFA is to compare the op amp's characteristics to the typical parameters of the Texas Instruments TLC2201. This comparison indicates that the LFA's performance is approximately equal to that of the TLC2201 in most respects.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/MWSCAS.1992.271174","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWSCAS.1992.271174","startPage":"1120","endPage":"1123 vol.2","displayPublicationTitle":"[1992] Proceedings of the 35th Midwest Symposium on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel2/622/6719/00271174.pdf","publicationTitle":"[1992] Proceedings of the 35th Midwest Symposium on Circuits and Systems","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6719","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A low noise CMOS operational amplifier in a 1.2 mu m digital technology","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-12 Aug 1992","displayDocTitle":"A low noise CMOS operational amplifier in a 1.2 mu m digital technology","conferenceDate":"9-12 Aug. 1992","publicationDate":"1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"4575352","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/271174/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A low noise CMOS operational amplifier in a 1.2 mu m digital technology","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"00271174.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.036857S","chronDate":"9-12 Aug 1992","isNumber":"6719","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"622","citationCount":"7","articleId":"271174","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":271179,"authors":[{"name":"T.M.

An exact methodology for analyzing the moments and spectra of the quantization noise sequence has been published. It was shown that the quantization noise approaches white noise only when the number of levels in the quantizer is large compared to the amplitude of the input sequence. This result was shown for an ideal oversampled Sigma Delta modulator. The authors extend this work to obtain an exact discrete-time representation of the moments of the quantization noise sequence for a first-order oversampled Sigma Delta modulator including the effects of the time constants associated with the switches and the op-amp of the integrator. The emphasis is on obtaining the moments in terms of the component values such that they may be used as design equations. These equations, therefore, allow the designer to trade off overall system performance and component values.

It can detect the feature of the input-output relationship at the third layer units in the learning process and unfold the feature to the output layer units, so that adaptive outputs are obtained at the output layer units even if the input patterns corrupted with noise are given. The ability largely depends on the steepness of the sigmoid function used at the hidden layer(s). While this is true for both types of networks, the steepness of the activation function of the hidden layer units nearest to the input layer influences the five-layered network most, and selection of suitable steepness yields the best performance. The reason why the heterogeneous five-layered network has much more robustness than the heterogeneous three-layered network is investigated. How the noise-filtering is done at the hidden layer units with a steep sigmoid function is examined.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/MWSCAS.1992.271185","startPage":"875","endPage":"878 vol.2","displayPublicationTitle":"[1992] Proceedings of the 35th Midwest Symposium on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel2/622/6719/00271185.pdf","publicationTitle":"[1992] Proceedings of the 35th Midwest Symposium on Circuits and Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWSCAS.1992.271185","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6719","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Novel noise-filtering ability of heterogeneous five layered neural network trained identity mapping using BP algorithm","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Feature extraction","Computer vision","Computer science","Costs","Noise robustness","Temperature"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["backpropagation","feedforward neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["heterogeneous five layered neural network","identity mapping","BP algorithm","robustness","input-output relationship","input patterns","sigmoid function","activation function","hidden layer units","noise-filtering"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/271185/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-12 Aug 1992","displayDocTitle":"Novel noise-filtering ability of heterogeneous five layered neural network trained identity mapping using BP algorithm","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"9-12 Aug. 1992","accessionNumber":"4575341","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Novel noise-filtering ability of heterogeneous five layered neural network trained identity mapping using BP algorithm","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"00271185.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.026755S","chronDate":"9-12 Aug 1992","isNumber":"6719","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"622","citationCount":"3","articleId":"271185","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":271193,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The objective is to determine the time distribution of measurement variances that minimizes a measure of error in forecasting a discrete-time, vector stochastic process by a linear estimator. The metric of estimation error used is the trace of weighted sum of estimation error covariance matrices at various time indices. When the stochastic process is a scalar, it is shown that this problem reduces to solving a quadratic programming problem with nonnegativity constraints on the optimization variables. For the special case when the vector stochastic process is the state of a linear, finite-dimensional stochastic system, the problem reduces to the solution of a nonlinear optimal control problem.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSMC.1992.271564","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6720","startPage":"1532","endPage":"1538 vol.2","displayPublicationTitle":"[Proceedings] 1992 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel2/665/6720/00271564.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal measurement scheduling for state estimation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/271564/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 Oct 1992","displayDocTitle":"Optimal measurement scheduling for state estimation","conferenceDate":"18-21 Oct. 1992","publicationDate":"1992","accessionNumber":"4595803","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal measurement scheduling for state estimation","confLoc":"Chicago, IL, USA","sourcePdf":"00271564.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051574S","chronDate":"18-21 Oct 1992","isNumber":"6720","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"665","citationCount":"1","articleId":"271564","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":271597,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Some of the applications that have been implemented with the toolbox include signal processing, sensor fusion, robotics, control, and fault diagnosis. At its lowest level, the toolbox consists of a software library written in C and Ada. This library is accessible directly, through command line routines, or through a graphical user interface on a high-performance workstation. This library significantly reduces the time necessary to develop neural network applications. Through the graphical interface, no programming is required to prototype an application using the paradigms. A network module can be created by simply selecting a network type and dragging it into a work area. The network structure and parameters may be tuned by manipulating graphical widgets such as sliders and dials. Module I/O can be sent between multiple network or nonnetwork modules by creating graphical pipes.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICSMC.1992.271597","startPage":"1351","endPage":"1357 vol.2","displayPublicationTitle":"[Proceedings] 1992 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel2/665/6720/00271597.pdf","publicationTitle":"[Proceedings] 1992 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSMC.1992.271597","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6720","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A neural network toolbox for application simulation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Application software","Software libraries","Artificial neural networks","Signal processing","Sensor fusion","Robot sensing systems","Robot control","Fault diagnosis","Graphical user interfaces"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["graphical user interfaces","neural nets","subroutines","virtual machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["paradigm library","GUI","neural network toolbox","application simulation","signal processing","sensor fusion","robotics","control","fault diagnosis","software library","C","Ada","command line routines","graphical user interface","high-performance workstation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/271597/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 Oct 1992","displayDocTitle":"A neural network toolbox for application simulation","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"18-21 Oct. 1992","accessionNumber":"4595770","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A neural network toolbox for application simulation","confLoc":"Chicago, IL, USA","sourcePdf":"00271597.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045928S","chronDate":"18-21 Oct 1992","isNumber":"6720","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"665","citationCount":"2","articleId":"271597","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":271603,"authors":[{"name":"N.

Two complementary structure/parameter learning algorithms are proposed for setting up the proposed neural-network-based fuzzy logic control system (NN-FLCS). First, a two-phase hybrid learning algorithm is proposed which combines unsupervised and supervised learning procedures to build the rule nodes and train the membership functions. The two-phase hybrid learning algorithm performs well if sets of training data are available offline. The authors then propose an online supervised structure/parameter learning algorithm for constructing the NN-FLCS dynamically. This algorithm combines the backpropagation learning scheme for the parameter learning and a fuzzy similarity measure for the structure learning. The proposed online structure/parameter learning algorithm can find proper fuzzy logic rules, membership functions, and the size of output fuzzy partitions simultaneously.

They are the only designs capable of meaningful planning or foresight. They are also the designs which have led to the most exciting real-world applications in recent years. Within the field of optimization over time, two classes of design have proven useful in practice: (1) direct optimization, using generalized backpropagation to calculate derivatives of utility or performance or cost: and (2) adaptive critic designs, which approximate dynamic programming. After a brief review of neurocontrol and an explanation of reinforcement learning, the author asks what implications these designs have for the understanding of the human mind. He argues that this new mathematics is fully compatible with older deep insights into the human mind, due to humanistic thinkers East and West. There is no real conflict between new ideas from neural network theory or physics and deep, classical ideas from Eastern and Western cultures; in fact, the new ideas may provide a basis for helping understand and appreciate the roots of the classical ideas at a deeper level.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 Oct 1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/271798/","accessionNumber":"4595569","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"18-21 Oct. 1992","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Neural networks and the human mind: new mathematics fits humanistic insight","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural networks and the human mind: new mathematics fits humanistic insight","confLoc":"Chicago, IL, USA","sourcePdf":"00271798.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042876S","chronDate":"18-21 Oct 1992","isNumber":"6720","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"665","citationCount":"5","articleId":"271798","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":271809,"authors":[{"name":"L.B.

Emphasis is placed on five different types of defects, i.e. missing components, misalignment, wrong orientation of IC chips, wrong parts, and poor solder joints. Five separate algorithms are developed to detect these faults. The technique of windowing is employed to reduce the amount of redundant data to be processed. Preprocessing functions like convolution, as well as all image processing tasks, are performed on the window regions only, thus saving computation time.

The new sensing scheme incorporates an offset compensating technique in a direct bit-line sensing scheme using a current-mirror differential amplifier.

The features of the circuit have been examined using simple DRAM test chips fabricated with a 0.5 /spl mu/m CMOS process.

The building blocks for the circuit consist of an unbalanced emitter-coupled pair with different emitter areas, an emitter-coupled pair with an input bias offset, and an unbalanced emitter-coupled pair with unbalanced emitter degeneration. A basic squaring circuit is realized from two identical unbalanced emitter-coupled pairs with emitter area ratio K and cross-coupled inputs and parallel-connected outputs. The quarter-square multipliers proposed in this paper can operate under low supply voltage (typically <3 V, and a minimum of 1 V). Therefore, the Gilbert multiplier, which has been the most popular analog multiplier in bipolar technology over the past few decades, can be replaced.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6723","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/4.272093","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel1/4/6723/00272093.pdf","startPage":"46","endPage":"55","doi":"10.1109/4.272093","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A bipolar four-quadrant analog quarter-square multiplier consisting of unbalanced emitter-coupled pairs and expansions of its input ranges","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1994","displayDocTitle":"A bipolar four-quadrant analog quarter-square multiplier consisting of unbalanced emitter-coupled pairs and expansions of its input ranges","volume":"29","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 1994","accessionNumber":"4666811","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/272093/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A bipolar four-quadrant analog quarter-square multiplier consisting of unbalanced emitter-coupled pairs and expansions of its input ranges","sourcePdf":"00272093.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.028199S","chronDate":"Jan 1994","isNumber":"6723","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"32","articleId":"272093","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":272096,"authors":[{"name":"W.-C.S.

The symmetrically configured complementary input stage provides a wide common-mode input voltage range. The amplifier performs as an operational transconductance amplifier (OTA) and displays a first-order dominant pole when loaded by a shunt capacitor. The transconductance amplifier is small in area (0.016 mm/sup 2/), and well suited for high frequency analog signal processing applications.

They can be used before any CPU-time consuming simulation takes place which allows a more efficient design and prototype phase.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/4.272120","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel1/4/6724/00272120.pdf","startPage":"143","endPage":"146","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00272120.png","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/4.272120","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6724","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Electrothermal simulation and design of integrated circuits","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/272120/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1994","displayDocTitle":"Electrothermal simulation and design of integrated circuits","volume":"29","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 1994","accessionNumber":"4666826","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Electrothermal simulation and design of integrated circuits","sourcePdf":"00272120.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.066516S","chronDate":"Feb 1994","isNumber":"6724","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"67","articleId":"272120","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":272140,"authors":[{"name":"O.M.

Therefore, a very large number of contributions have appeared on this subject. But virtually all of them deal with simplified versions of the complete synthesis problem, wherein the degrees of freedom available in principle are strongly reduced, and/or idealized design criteria or requirements are considered. In this paper we present a formulation which allows us to overcome this fragmentation of the synthesis problem. A clear and direct description of the performance actually required by the antenna and a representation of the radiating properties of the antenna as a system allows us to formulate the synthesis problem as an intersections finding problem, i.e., to find a common element between a number of sets, each one containing elements fulfilling part of the requirements. This allows a completely general and flexible formulation of the problem, independent of the actual structure of the antenna. Then the practical implementation of this formulation is widely discussed, showing how an efficient solution procedure can be devised. The implications of the well-known ill-conditioning of the synthesis problem are also discussed. In order to show how the approach works and to assess its flexibility and power, a couple of significant examples are included, namely, a phase-only reconfigurable array and a shaped reflector synthesis. These examples are unconventional since no a priori choice of the intensity distribution (for the array case) or of the feed cluster (for the reflector case) is required. The method presented is able to exploit all the available degrees of freedom in order to fulfill the design requirements.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/5.272140","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel1/5/6725/00272140.pdf","startPage":"358","endPage":"371","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00272140.png","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/5.272140","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6725","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Antenna pattern synthesis: a new general approach","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=272140","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/272140/","displayDocTitle":"Antenna pattern synthesis: a new general approach","volume":"82","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 1994","accessionNumber":"4680833","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Antenna pattern synthesis: a new general approach","sourcePdf":"00272140.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.050916S","chronDate":"March  1994","isNumber":"6725","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"192","articleId":"272140","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-22"},{"_id":272142,"authors":[{"name":"R.N.

The Fourier transform, which has constituted the standard approach to spectral analysis, is understood both in the domain of numerical analysis and in the world of natural phenomena, gaining its central significance from the ubiquity of sinusoidal natural behavior; it also gains appeal from the convenience offered by complex variable analysis, which is a basic part of technical education. Computers, however, prefer real numbers, an attribute that first opened a niche for the Hartley transform. As applications have multiplied, and others open up, it will be helpful to understand the Hartley idea from more than one point of view. Several topics, including multidimensional transforms, the complex generalization, and microwave phase measurement by amplitude measurement only, are discussed with the intention of throwing light on the numerical and physical relationships between the Hartley and Fourier transforms.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/5.272142","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6725","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00272142.png","startPage":"381","endPage":"387","pdfPath":"/iel1/5/6725/00272142.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/5.272142","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Aspects of the Hartley transform","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fourier transforms","Optical signal processing","Phase measurement","Multidimensional signal processing","Optical computing","Physics computing","Microwave theory and techniques","Spectral analysis","Numerical analysis","Computer science education"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["transforms","signal processing","microwaves","spectral analysis","numerical analysis","phase measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Hartley transform","signal processing","computational technique","multidimensional transforms","complex generalization","microwave phase measurement","amplitude measurement"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1994","displayDocTitle":"Aspects of the Hartley transform","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/272142/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","volume":"82","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4680834","publicationDate":"March 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Aspects of the Hartley transform","sourcePdf":"00272142.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037649S","chronDate":"March  1994","isNumber":"6725","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"35","articleId":"272142","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":272145,"authors":[{"name":"J.

The construction is carried out over the reals, but is shown to be valid over more general fields. We show that these basefield transforms can be viewed as \"projections\" of the discrete Fourier transform (DFT). Furthermore, by imposing an additional condition on the projections, one may obtain self-inverse versions of the basefield transforms. Applying the theory to the real and complex fields, we show that the projection of the complex DFT results in the discrete combinational Fourier transform (DCFT) and that the imposition of the self-inverse condition on the DCFT yields the discrete Hartley transform (DHT). Additionally, we show that the method of projection may be used to derive efficient basefield transform algorithms by projecting standard FFT algorithms from the extension field to the basefield. Using such an approach, we show that many of the existing real Hartley algorithms are projections of well-known FFT algorithms.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Basefield transforms with the convolution property","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","doi":"10.1109/5.272145","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel1/5/6725/00272145.pdf","startPage":"400","endPage":"412","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00272145.png","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/5.272145","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6725","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=272145","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/272145/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1994","displayDocTitle":"Basefield transforms with the convolution property","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"82","issue":"3","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"March 1994","accessionNumber":"4680837","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Basefield transforms with the convolution property","sourcePdf":"00272145.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.035216S","chronDate":"March  1994","isNumber":"6725","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"10","articleId":"272145","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":272146,"authors":[{"name":"R.P.

It has some advantages over the Fourier transform in the analysis of real signals as it avoids the use of complex arithmetic. However, the Hartley transform has other applications in signal and image reconstruction related to traditional phase retrieval problems. These can he understood by examining the analytic properties of the Hartley transform in the complex plane. In this paper, the analytic continuation of the Hartley transform into the complex plane is derived and its properties discussed. It is shown that for signals or images of finite extent, the Hartley transform is analytic in the entire finite complex plane, and this is used to derive properties of its complex zeros. Hilbert transform-type relationships for the Hartley transform, related to causal and analytic-signals, are also derived. The analytic properties derived are used to study the problem of image reconstruction from the Hartley transform intensity. Uniqueness and reconstruction algorithms for one- and two-dimensional problems are discussed, and examples are presented.

In the first step, the structure of the amplitude and the multivariate probability density functions (pdfs) describing the statistical properties of the clutter is derived. The starting point for this derivation is the basic scattering problem, and the statistics are obtained from an extension of the central limit theorem (CLT). This extension leads to modeling the clutter amplitude statistics by a mixture of Rayleigh distributions. The end product of the first step is a multidimensional pdf in the form of a Gaussian mixture, which is then used in step 2. The aim of step 2 is to derive both the optimal and a suboptimal detection structure for detecting radar targets in this type of clutter.

MSF provides the appropriate transfer function matrix and realization theory specifies the corresponding parameters of a linear system having this transfer function This approach can be used to correctly capture the cross correlations that exist in a multichannel vector random process (representing a particular radar target signature). Aspects of the solution to this problem are illustrated using an original representative example problem with a closed-form answer. Existing software programs for accomplishing MSF are identified and one has been successfully validated using the known closed-form solution mentioned above. A streamlined realization algorithm (offered here as the primary theoretical contribution) can be used along with the MSF computer program and can now be applied to actual radar data.

Application of a one-dimensional Fourier transform to each range bin converts each subaperture data set into a full-scene image (map). Any linear phase difference, or phase ramp, between a pair of subapertures expresses itself as cross-range drift in their maps. A traditional autofocus algorithm fits a polynomial to inferred equal-width phase ramps. If the true phase error function contains significant high-order components, then polynomial regression generates a poor estimate of the phase error function. Instead of filling a polynomial, we fit a sinusoidal function through the inferred phase ramps. An example with a degraded SAR image shows how a sinusoidal correction improves image quality. We compare lower bounds on mean squared error (MSE) for polynomial and sinusoidal parameterizations. Sinusoidal parameterization reduces MSE significantly for model orders greater than five.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/7.272285","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","pdfPath":"/iel4/7/6728/00272285.pdf","startPage":"617","endPage":"621","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00272285.png","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/7.272285","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6728","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Subaperture autofocus for synthetic aperture radar","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=272285","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/272285/","displayDocTitle":"Subaperture autofocus for synthetic aperture radar","volume":"30","issue":"2","publicationDate":"April 1994","accessionNumber":"4660665","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Subaperture autofocus for synthetic aperture radar","sourcePdf":"00272285.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.03319S","chronDate":"Apr 1994","isNumber":"6728","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7","citationCount":"79","articleId":"272285","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":272289,"authors":[{"name":"S.B.

For good overall accuracy the author shows that all schemes should be run at their Courant stability limit, and that the timestep should finely resolve the medium timescales. Particularly, for Debye schemes it should be at least /spl Delta/t=10/sup /spl minus/3//spl tau/, while for Lorentz schemes it should be /spl Delta/t=10/sup /spl minus/2//spl tau/, where /spl tau/ is a typical medium relaxation time. A numerical experiment with a Debye medium confirms this. The author has determined that two of the discretizations for Debye media are totally equivalent. In the Lorentz medium case the author establishes that the method that uses the polarization differential equation to model dispersion is stable for all wavenumbers, and that the method using the local-in-time constitutive relation is weakly unstable for modes with wavenumber k such that k/spl Delta/x>/spl pi//2.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Stability and phase error analysis of FD-TD in dispersive dielectrics","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/8.272302","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel4/8/6729/00272302.pdf","startPage":"62","endPage":"69","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/8.272302","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6729","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=272302","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/272302/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1994","displayDocTitle":"Stability and phase error analysis of FD-TD in dispersive dielectrics","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"42","issue":"1","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Jan. 1994","accessionNumber":"4666839","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Stability and phase error analysis of FD-TD in dispersive dielectrics","sourcePdf":"00272302.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.029439S","chronDate":"Jan 1994","isNumber":"6729","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"73","articleId":"272302","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":272304,"authors":[{"name":"P.

In long tunnels, the amplitude of the electric field radiated by a retransmitting antenna can be easily calculated from ray theory. However, for short tunnels, one of the most critical points is either the radiation towards free space of a mobile station emitting in the tunnel or, on the contrary, the penetration of an external wave inside the tunnel. This coupling between the inside and the outside is treated through the uniform theory of diffraction. By comparing theoretical and experimental results, it is shown that this theory leads to adequate prediction of the field variation and allows the authors to point out the influence of parameters, such as the position of the mobile in the tunnel and the influence of the angle of incidence, on the entrance plane of an incoming external wave.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/8.272304","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel4/8/6729/00272304.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/8.272304","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6729","startPage":"75","endPage":"81","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Theoretical and experimental approach of the propagation of high frequency waves in road tunnels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=272304","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Theoretical and experimental approach of the propagation of high frequency waves in road tunnels","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/272304/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1994","isJournal":true,"volume":"42","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 1994","accessionNumber":"4666841","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Theoretical and experimental approach of the propagation of high frequency waves in road tunnels","sourcePdf":"00272304.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.056231S","chronDate":"Jan 1994","isNumber":"6729","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"88","articleId":"272304","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":272306,"authors":[{"name":"A.E.

We focus on reducing the Boolean equations describing the device and the incorporation of new mechanisms in the interlock collapsing ALU design. In particular, we focus on the reduction of the critical path, regarding delay, for the interlock collapsing ALU implementation. It is shown that the delay associated with the implementation of the proposed device, in terms of logic stages, assuming a commonly available CMOS technology, is equivalent to the number of logic stages required for the implementation of a 3-1 binary adder. The resulting implementation demonstrates that the proposed 3-1 interlock collapsing ALU can be designed to outperform existing schemes for interlock collapsing ALU's by a factor of at least two. Finally, it is suggested that the proposed device can be used in the implementation of multiple instruction issuing machines, allowing the issuance and execution of interlocks in parallel and in a single machine cycle with no cycle time increases.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/12.272427","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel1/12/6733/00272427.pdf","startPage":"257","endPage":"268","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/12.272427","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6733","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High-performance 3-1 interlock collapsing ALU's","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=272427","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/272427/","displayDocTitle":"High-performance 3-1 interlock collapsing ALU's","volume":"43","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 1994","accessionNumber":"4660618","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High-performance 3-1 interlock collapsing ALU's","sourcePdf":"00272427.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.119295S","chronDate":"Mar 1994","isNumber":"6733","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"20","articleId":"272427","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":272429,"authors":[{"name":"W.F.

Yet due to their inherent nature, they are a considerable computing task by themselves. Not surprisingly, since the dawn of computing, the goal of speeding up elementary function computation has been pursued. This paper describes new hardware based algorithms for the computation of the common elementary functions, namely division, logarithm, reciprocal square root, arc tangent, sine and cosine. These algorithms exploit microscopic parallelism using specialized hardware with heavy use of truncation based on detailed accuracy analysis. The contribution of this work lies in the fact that these algorithms are very fast and yet are accurate. If we let the time to perform an IEEE Standard 754 double precision floating point multiplication be /spl tau//sub /spl times//, our algorithms to achieve roughly 3.68/spl tau//sub /spl times//,4.56/spl tau//sub /spl times//, 5.25/spl tau//sub /spl times//, 3.69/spl tau//sub /spl times//, 7.06/spl tau//sub /spl times//, and 6.5/spl tau//sub /spl times//, for division, logarithm, square root, exponential, are tangent and complex exponential (sine and cosine) respectively. The trade-off is the need for tables and some specialized hardware. The total amount of tables required, however, is less than 128 Kbytes. We discuss the hardware, algorithmic and accuracy aspects of these algorithms.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/272429/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1994","volume":"43","issue":"3","accessionNumber":"4660620","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"March 1994","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Fast hardware-based algorithms for elementary function computations using rectangular multipliers","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast hardware-based algorithms for elementary function computations using rectangular multipliers","sourcePdf":"00272429.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.083368S","chronDate":"Mar 1994","isNumber":"6733","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"62","articleId":"272429","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":272436,"authors":[{"name":"S.

This problem is of importance in communications environments such as spread-spectrum radio networks, in which nonorthogonal multiplexing is used. Multiuser amplitude estimation is a critical prerequisite to the optimum demodulation of such signals using, for example, Verdu's algorithm. In the present paper, a sequential detection-estimation approach is applied to this problem, and several estimation paradigms, including the method of moments and likelihood-based estimators, are considered. The consistency, asymptotic variance, and complexity of these estimators are examined. A new method of constructing a recursive consistent and asymptotically efficient estimation algorithm out of a consistent estimator sequence is also suggested and is applied to the current setup. It is seen that detector-estimators that use these estimators in Verdu's algorithm result, asymptotically, in (known-amplitude) optimum error probabilities with little relative increase in complexity per demodulated bit.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/18.272451","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","startPage":"11","endPage":"20","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel1/18/6734/00272451.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/18.272451","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6734","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sequential amplitude estimation in multiuser communications","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Amplitude estimation","Demodulation","Recursive estimation","Delay","Maximum likelihood detection","Digital communication","Spread spectrum communication","Radio network","Moment methods","Error probability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["estimation theory","parameter estimation","multi-access systems","signal detection","numerical analysis","maximum likelihood estimation","digital communication systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiuser amplitude estimation","sequential amplitude estimation","digital communications signals","channel","spread-spectrum radio networks","nonorthogonal multiplexing","optimum demodulation","Verdu's algorithm","sequential detection-estimation approach","method of moments","likelihood-based estimators","consistency","asymptotic variance","complexity","estimation algorithm","optimum error probabilities"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1994","displayDocTitle":"Sequential amplitude estimation in multiuser communications","volume":"40","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4666852","publicationDate":"Jan. 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/272451/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sequential amplitude estimation in multiuser communications","sourcePdf":"00272451.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.032334S","chronDate":"Jan 1994","isNumber":"6734","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"12","articleId":"272451","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":272453,"authors":[{"name":"V.V.

In the fixed code, an approximate formula is given for the optimal value of the prediction coefficient. This is then used as an initial guess to optimize the code (predictor and quantizer) through a numerical method. In the forward adaptive scheme, the state of the switch in the composite source is estimated using a MAP sequence estimation algorithm, and the code is then matched to the mode process corresponding to the estimated switch state. The performance of the two systems is evaluated with quantizers of 4, 8, and 16 levels. The results show that the forward adaptive scheme significantly outperforms optimized fixed DPCM in the sense of mean-squared error. Stochastic stability of the code is also established for the fixed DPCM scheme as well as for an adaptive scheme which receives the switch state as side information.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/18.272473","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/18.272473","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel1/18/6734/00272473.pdf","startPage":"153","endPage":"160","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6734","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/272473/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1994","displayDocTitle":"DPCM encoding of regenerative composite processes","volume":"40","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4666865","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Jan. 1994","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"DPCM encoding of regenerative composite processes","sourcePdf":"00272473.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.208295S","chronDate":"Jan 1994","isNumber":"6734","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"2","articleId":"272473","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":272474,"authors":[{"name":"K.T.

That work showed the ability to correct most cases of d-2 or fewer erroneous block symbols, where d is the outer code minimum distance. Any parity check code can be used as the basis for the outer codes, and yet decoding complexity increases at most as the third power of the code length. In this correspondence, it is shown that, with a slight modification and no significant increase in complexity, the general decoding technique can be applied to the correction of many other cases beyond the code minimum distance. By considering average performance over all binary randomly chosen codes, it is seen that most error patterns of t/sub M/ or fewer block errors can be corrected, where: 1) t/sub M/ in most cases is much greater than the code minimum distance, and 2) asymptotically, the ratio of t/sub M/ to the theoretical maximum (the number of parity symbol blocks) approaches 1. Moreover, most cases of noncorrectable error block patterns are detected.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/18.272474","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel1/18/6734/00272474.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/18.272474","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6734","startPage":"160","endPage":"166","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance of a general decoding technique over the class of randomly chosen parity check codes","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=272474","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Performance of a general decoding technique over the class of randomly chosen parity check codes","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/272474/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1994","isJournal":true,"volume":"40","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 1994","accessionNumber":"4666866","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance of a general decoding technique over the class of randomly chosen parity check codes","sourcePdf":"00272474.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.09203S","chronDate":"Jan 1994","isNumber":"6734","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"6","articleId":"272474","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":272476,"authors":[{"name":"S.

Two maximum a posteriori (MAP) formulations are considered: (i) a sequence MAP detection in which the objective is to determine the most probable transmitted sequence given the observed sequence and (ii) an instantaneous MAP detection which is to determine the most probable transmitted symbol at time n given all the observations prior to and including time n. The solution to the first problem results in a \"Viterbi-like\" implementation of the MAP detector (with Large delay) while the latter problem results in a recursive implementation (with no delay). For the special case of the binary symmetric Markov source and binary symmetric channel, simulation results are presented and an analysis of these two systems yields explicit critical channel bit error rates above which the MAP detectors become useful. Applications of the MAP detection problem in a combined source-channel coding system are considered. Here, it is assumed that the source is highly correlated and that the source encoder (a vector quantizer (VQ)) fails to remove all of the source redundancy. The remaining redundancy at the output of the source encoder is referred to as the \"residual\" redundancy. It is shown, through simulation, that the residual redundancy can be used by the MAP detectors to combat channel errors. For small block sizes, the proposed system beats Farvardin and Vaishampayan's channel-optimized VQ by wide margins. Finally, it is shown that the instantaneous MAP detector can be combined with the VQ decoder to form an approximate minimum mean-squared error decoder.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal detection of discrete Markov sources over discrete memoryless channels/spl minus/applications to combined source-channel coding","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","doi":"10.1109/18.272478","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel1/18/6734/00272478.pdf","startPage":"186","endPage":"193","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/18.272478","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6734","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=272478","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/272478/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1994","displayDocTitle":"Optimal detection of discrete Markov sources over discrete memoryless channels/spl minus/applications to combined source-channel coding","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"40","issue":"1","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Jan. 1994","accessionNumber":"4666870","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal detection of discrete Markov sources over discrete memoryless channels/spl minus/applications to combined source-channel coding","sourcePdf":"00272478.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.031313S","chronDate":"Jan 1994","isNumber":"6734","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"110","articleId":"272478","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":272483,"authors":[{"name":"D.

While Fano's inequality provides a tight lower bound on the error probability in terms of the entropy, the present authors derive a converse result/spl mdash/a tight upper bound on the minimal error probability in terms of the entropy. Both bounds are sharp, and can draw a relation, as well, between the error probability for the maximum a posteriori (MAP) rule, and the conditional entropy (equivocation), which is a useful uncertainty measure in several applications. Combining this relation and the classical channel coding theorem, the authors present a channel coding theorem for the equivocation which, unlike the channel coding theorem for error probability, is meaningful at all rates. This theorem is proved directly for DMCs, and from this proof it is further concluded that for R/spl ges/C the equivocation achieves its minimal value of R/spl minus/C at the rate of n/sup 1/spl sol/2/ where n is the block length.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/18.272494","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6734","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/18.272494","endPage":"266","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel1/18/6734/00272494.pdf","startPage":"259","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Relations between entropy and error probability","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/272494/","displayDocTitle":"Relations between entropy and error probability","volume":"40","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"4666886","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Jan. 1994","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Relations between entropy and error probability","sourcePdf":"00272494.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044101S","chronDate":"Jan 1994","isNumber":"6734","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"112","articleId":"272494","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":272496,"authors":[{"name":"Yuan Xing Li","affiliation":["Magnetic Technology Centre, National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"lastName":"Yuan Xing Li","id":"37066646500"},{"name":"R.H.

In a conventional inductor, conductor wires are wound around magnetic cores. By switching the roles of conductor wire and magnetic core, i.e., by 'wrapping' a magnetic core around a conductor wire, the same effect can be realized in a planar geometry. This geometry has been implemented using multilevel metal interconnection schemes, by interlacing a meander planar conductor with a multilevel meander magnetic core. The total inductor size is 4 mm/spl times/1.0 mm, the coil has 30 turns, and the magnetic material used was electroplated nickel(81%)-iron(19%) Permalloy. An inductance of 30 nH/mm/sup 2/ was achieved at a frequency of 5 MHz. The fabrication sequence of this inductor structure is entirely compatible with post-processing of standard bipolar and CMOS circuitry, as well as the fabrication of multichip module substrates, thus enabling the integration of the inductor structure with control circuitry for applications such as filters, sensors, magnetic microactuators, and low-power voltage converters.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/272517/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Jan. 1994","accessionNumber":"4667001","volume":"30","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A new toroidal-meander type integrated inductor with a multilevel meander magnetic core","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new toroidal-meander type integrated inductor with a multilevel meander magnetic core","sourcePdf":"00272517.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.026848S","chronDate":"Jan.  1994","isNumber":"6735","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"58","articleId":"272517","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":272521,"authors":[{"name":"Z.Q.

The Volcano effort provides a rich environment for research and education in database systems design, heuristics for query optimization, parallel query execution, and resource allocation. Volcano uses a standard interface between algebra operators, allowing easy addition of new operators and operator implementations. Operations on individual items, e.g., predicates, are imported into the query processing operators using support functions. The semantics of support functions is not prescribed; any data type including complex objects and any operation can be realized. Thus, Volcano is extensible with new operators, algorithms, data types, and type-specific methods. Volcano includes two novel meta-operators. The choose-plan meta-operator supports dynamic query evaluation plans that allow delaying selected optimization decisions until run-time, e.g., for embedded queries with free variables. The exchange meta-operator supports intra-operator parallelism on partitioned datasets and both vertical and horizontal inter-operator parallelism, translating between demand-driven dataflow within processes and data-driven dataflow between processes. All operators, with the exception of the exchange operator, have been designed and implemented in a single-process environment, and parallelized using the exchange operator. Even operators not yet designed can be parallelized using this new operator if they use and provide the interator interface. Thus, the issues of data manipulation and parallelism have become orthogonal, making Volcano the first implemented query execution engine that effectively combines extensibility and parallelism.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6750","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel3/69/6750/00273032.pdf","doi":"10.1109/69.273032","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/69.273032","startPage":"120","endPage":"135","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Volcano/spl minus/an extensible and parallel query evaluation system","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/273032/","displayDocTitle":"Volcano/spl minus/an extensible and parallel query evaluation system","isJournal":true,"volume":"6","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"4675700","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Feb. 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Volcano/spl minus/an extensible and parallel query evaluation system","sourcePdf":"00273032.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.055404S","chronDate":"Feb 1994","isNumber":"6750","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"69","citationCount":"137","articleId":"273032","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":273050,"authors":[{"name":"A.N.

We are given a long sequence of data sets, each of which is to undergo processing by a collection of tasks whose intertask data dependencies form a series-parallel partial order. Each individual task is potentially parallelizable, with a known experimentally determined execution signature. Recognizing that data sets can be pipelined through the task structure, the problem is to find a \"good\" assignment of processors to tasks. Two objectives interest us: minimal response time per data set, given a throughput requirement, and maximal throughput, given a response time requirement. Our approach is to decompose a series-parallel task system into its essential \"serial\" and \"parallel\" components; our problem admits the independent solution and recomposition of each such component. We provide algorithms for the series analysis, and use an algorithm due to Krishnamurti and Ma for the parallel analysis. For a p processor system and a series-parallel precedence graph with n constituent tasks, we give a O(np/sup 2/) algorithm that finds the optimal assignment (over a broad class of assignments) for the response time optimization problem; we find the assignment optimizing the constrained throughput in O(np/sup 2/ log p) time. These techniques are applied to a task system in computer vision.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","pdfPath":"/iel4/71/6751/00273050.pdf","startPage":"439","endPage":"445","doi":"10.1109/71.273050","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/71.273050","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6751","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal processor assignment for a class of pipelined computations","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/273050/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1994","displayDocTitle":"Optimal processor assignment for a class of pipelined computations","publicationDate":"April 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4685645","isJournal":true,"volume":"5","issue":"4","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal processor assignment for a class of pipelined computations","sourcePdf":"00273050.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.052044S","chronDate":"Apr 1994","isNumber":"6751","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"71","citationCount":"38","articleId":"273050","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":273060,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The proposed RNN-FLCS is constructed by integrating two neural-network-based fuzzy logic controllers (NN-FLC's), each of which is a connectionist model with a feedforward multilayered network developed for the realization of a fuzzy logic controller. One NN-FLC performs as a fuzzy predictor, and the other as a fuzzy controller. Using the temporal difference prediction method, the fuzzy predictor can predict the external reinforcement signal and provide a more informative internal reinforcement signal to the fuzzy controller. The fuzzy controller performs a stochastic exploratory algorithm to adapt itself according to the internal reinforcement signal. During the learning process, both structure learning and parameter learning are performed simultaneously in the two NN-FLC's using the fuzzy similarity measure. The proposed RNN-FLCS can construct a fuzzy logic control and decision-making system automatically and dynamically through a reward/penalty signal or through very simple fuzzy information feedback such as \"high,\" \"too high,\" \"low,\" and \"too low.\" The proposed RNN-FLCS is best applied to the learning environment, where obtaining exact training data is expensive. It also preserves the advantages of the original NN-FLC, such as the ability to find proper network structure and parameters simultaneously and dynamically and to avoid the rule-matching time of the inference engine. Computer simulations were conducted to illustrate its performance and applicability.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","pdfPath":"/iel4/91/6756/00273126.pdf","startPage":"46","endPage":"63","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","doi":"10.1109/91.273126","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/91.273126","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6756","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=273126","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reinforcement structure/parameter learning for neural-network-based fuzzy logic control systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fuzzy control","Fuzzy logic","Control systems","Automatic control","Learning","Prediction methods","Stochastic processes","Performance evaluation","Decision making","Fuzzy systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fuzzy control","parameter estimation","learning (artificial intelligence)","feedforward neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["reinforcement structure learning","parameter learning","reinforcement neural-network-based fuzzy logic control system","reinforcement learning problems","connectionist model","feedforward multilayer network","temporal difference prediction method","stochastic exploratory algorithm","fuzzy similarity measure","fuzzy decision-making system","reward/penalty signal","fuzzy information feedback","parameter identification","network structure identification"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/273126/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1994","displayDocTitle":"Reinforcement structure/parameter learning for neural-network-based fuzzy logic control systems","volume":"2","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 1994","accessionNumber":"4669185","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reinforcement structure/parameter learning for neural-network-based fuzzy logic control systems","sourcePdf":"00273126.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.054409S","chronDate":"Feb 1994","isNumber":"6756","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"91","citationCount":"203","articleId":"273126","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":273127,"authors":[{"name":"Chuen-Tsai Sun","affiliation":["Department of Computer and Information Science, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Chuen-Tsai Sun","id":"37087207186"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6706"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0034"}],"articleNumber":"273127","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":146,"citationCountPatent":11,"totalDownloads":560},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computational Intelligence Society","url":"http://ieee-cis.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interpolation","Adaptive systems","Kalman filters","Filtering algorithms","Surface structures","Data structures","Impedance matching","Parallel processing","Fuzzy systems","Parallel algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["inference mechanisms","uncertainty handling","parallel algorithms","knowledge based systems","feedforward neural nets","Kalman filters","image recognition","fuzzy set theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Jang's architecture","rule base structure identification","adaptive network","fuzzy inference system","Kalman filtering","interpolation","modelling","top-down approach","bottom-up approach","data structure","fuzzy binary boxtree","parallel processing","fuzzy rule based inference","parallel algorithm","pattern matching","image coding","data compression"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=273127","abstract":"We summarize Jang's architecture of employing an adaptive network and the Kalman filtering algorithm to identify the system parameters.

We generalize Jang's basic model so that it can be used to solve classification problems by employing parameterized t-norms. We also enhance the model to include weights of importance so that feature selection becomes a component of the modeling scheme. Next, we discuss two ways of identifying system structures based on Jang's architecture: the top-down approach, and the bottom-up approach. We introduce a data structure, called a fuzzy binary boxtree, to organize rules so that the rule base can be matched against input signals with logarithmic efficiency. To preserve the advantage of parallel processing assumed in fuzzy rule-based inference systems, we give a parallel algorithm for pattern matching with a linear speedup. Moreover, as we consider the communication and storage cost of an interpolation model. We propose a rule combination mechanism to build a simplified version of the original rule base according to a given focus set.

Based on prior knowledge, the process to be controlled is divided into fuzzy regions such as high-gain, low-gain, large-time-constant, and small-time-constant. Then a fuzzy controller is designed based on the regional information. Using an auxiliary process variable to detect the process operating regions, the resulting multiregion fuzzy logic controller can give satisfactory performance in all regions.

This research is important for industry since it is well known that these early high level decisions have the greatest impact on the final VLSI implementation. Optimal application-specific architectures are synthesized here to minimize latency given constraints on chip area, I/O pin count and interchip communication delays. A mathematical integer programming (IP) model for simultaneously partitioning, scheduling, and allocating hardware (functional units, I/O pins, and interchip busses) is formulated. By exploiting the problem structure, using polyhedral theory, the size of the search space is decreased and a new variable selection strategy is introduced based on the branch and bound algorithm. Multichip optimal architectures for several examples are synthesized in practical cpu times. Execution times are comparable to previous heuristic approaches, however there are significant improvements in optimal schedules and allocations of multichips. This research breaks new ground by 1) simultaneously partitioning, scheduling, and allocating in practical cpu times, 2) guaranteeing globally optimal architectures for multichip systems for a specific objective function, and 3) supporting interchip communication delay, interchip bus allocation, and other complex interface constraints.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel4/92/6757/00273145.pdf","startPage":"11","endPage":"20","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","doi":"10.1109/92.273145","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/92.273145","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6757","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=273145","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An optimization approach to the synthesis of multichip architectures","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Delay","Optimal scheduling","Very large scale integration","Job shop scheduling","High level synthesis","Linear programming","Mathematical model","Hardware","Pins","Input variables"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["logic CAD","VLSI","application specific integrated circuits","integer programming","circuit CAD","digital signal processing chips"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multichip architectures","high level synthesis","VLSI","application-specific architectures","latency given constraints","chip area","I/O pin count","interchip communication delays","integer programming","partitioning","scheduling","polyhedral theory","search space","variable selection strategy","branch and bound algorithm","globally optimal architectures","bus allocation","interface constraints"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/273145/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1994","displayDocTitle":"An optimization approach to the synthesis of multichip architectures","volume":"2","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 1994","accessionNumber":"4669190","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An optimization approach to the synthesis of multichip architectures","sourcePdf":"00273145.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.067888S","chronDate":"March  1994","isNumber":"6757","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"19","articleId":"273145","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":273147,"authors":[{"name":"N.J.

The diversity of response provided by diversely polarized antenna arrays can greatly improve direction-finding performance over arrays sensitive to only one polarization component. For d emitters, directly implementing a multidimensional estimation algorithm would require a search for 3d parameters: d directions of arrival (DOAs), and 2d polarization parameters. A more efficient solution is presented based on the noise subspace fitting (NSF) algorithm. It is shown how to decouple the NSF search into a two-step procedure, where the DOAs are estimated separately. The polarization parameters are then obtained by solving a linear system of equations. The advantage of this approach is that the search dimension is reduced by a factor of three, and no initial polarization estimate is required. The algorithm can be shown to yield asymptotically minimum variance estimates: provided no perfectly coherent signals are present.

The system order is the only a priori knowledge required on the plant. The adaptive control law is free from singularities in the sense that the estimated plant model is always controllable. The singularities are overcome by a suitable parameter estimates modification which is based upon standard least squares covariance matrix properties.

Then, we investigate conditions under which /spl Sigma/ can be rendered lossless via smooth state feedback. In particular, we show that this is possible if and only if the system in question has relative degree /spl lcub/0,...,0/spl rcub/ and has lossless zero dynamics. Under suitable controllability-like rank conditions, we prove that nonlinear systems having relative degree /spl lcub/0,...,0/spl rcub/ and lossless zero dynamics can be globally stabilized by smooth state feedback. As a consequence, we obtain sufficient conditions for a class of cascaded systems to be globally stabilizable. The global stabilization problem of the nonlinear system /spl Sigma/ without output is also investigated in this paper by means of feedback equivalence.

This upper bound is also valid for previous stabilization techniques and for the universally stabilizing supervisory mechanism.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A regulator stabilization technique: Kumar-Seidman revisited","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","doi":"10.1109/9.273366","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","pdfPath":"/iel4/9/6766/00273366.pdf","startPage":"191","endPage":"196","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/9.273366","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6766","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=273366","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/273366/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1994","displayDocTitle":"A regulator stabilization technique: Kumar-Seidman revisited","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"39","issue":"1","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Jan. 1994","accessionNumber":"4644572","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A regulator stabilization technique: Kumar-Seidman revisited","sourcePdf":"00273366.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.048163S","chronDate":"Jan 1994","isNumber":"6766","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9","citationCount":"39","articleId":"273366","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":273369,"authors":[{"name":"Jin-Hoon Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, KAIST, Daejeon, South Korea"],"lastName":"Jin-Hoon Kim","id":"37087166507"},{"name":"Zeungnam Bien","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, KAIST, Daejeon, South Korea"],"lastName":"Zeungnam Bien","id":"37086982001"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9286"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2523"},{"format":"CD","value":"2334-3303"}],"articleNumber":"273369","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":34,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":226},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Control Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieeecss.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=273369","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robust stability","Linear systems","Hydraulic actuators","State feedback","Linear feedback control systems","Control systems","Uncertainty","Output feedback","Distributed control","Sufficient conditions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["linear systems","stability criteria","closed loop systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["robust stability","uncertain linear systems","saturating actuators","stability conditions","closed loop system"]}],"abstract":"We consider the robust stability of uncertain linear systems with saturating actuators, and present two sufficient conditions to guarantee the stability of the closed loop system.

The method requires a full nonlinear analysis of the circuit. This analysis relies upon harmonic balance techniques and is suitable for monolithic circuits simulation. First, a modified formulation of the general harmonic balance equation is proposed which includes the presence of probes. These probes allow us to suppress the degenerated solution of the HB equation in autonomous cases. Moreover, a global stability analysis of phaselocked regimes is carried out. It provides invaluable information on the nonlinear behavior of the device. In particular, synchronization bandwidths as well as power ranges for which the circuit can be synchronized are obtained from the stability loci drawn in the parameter space. All these features have been used to design a broadband monolithic frequency divider, and the simulated and experimental results have been compared with very good accuracy. Therefore, the method proposed is a very useful tool for the design of potentially unstable circuits.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Signal design","Microwave frequencies","Frequency conversion","Circuit analysis","Circuit simulation","Nonlinear equations","Probes","Frequency synchronization","Design methodology","Injection-locked oscillators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frequency dividers","microwave oscillators","MMIC","nonlinear network analysis","nonlinear network synthesis","synchronisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["broadband monolithic microwave frequency dividers","phase-locked oscillators","large signal design","injection-locked oscillators","full nonlinear analysis","harmonic balance techniques","monolithic circuits simulation","global stability analysis","phaselocked regimes","synchronization bandwidths","power ranges","stability loci","circuit design"]}],"doi":"10.1109/22.273418","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel1/22/6768/00273418.pdf","startPage":"1928","endPage":"1938","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6768","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/22.273418","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Large signal design of broadband monolithic microwave frequency dividers and phase-locked oscillators","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=273418","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Large signal design of broadband monolithic microwave frequency dividers and phase-locked oscillators","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/273418/","volume":"41","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 1993","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4644695","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1993","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1993","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Large signal design of broadband monolithic microwave frequency dividers and phase-locked oscillators","sourcePdf":"00273418.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.048424S","chronDate":"Nov 1993","isNumber":"6768","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"66","articleId":"273418","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":273422,"authors":[{"name":"R.

It is not known how long these fields must persist to initiate SEGR.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/23.273457","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6769","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/23.273457","endPage":"1966","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel1/23/6769/00273457.pdf","startPage":"1959","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A conceptual model of a single-event gate-rupture in power MOSFETs","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1993","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/273457/","displayDocTitle":"A conceptual model of a single-event gate-rupture in power MOSFETs","volume":"40","issue":"6","accessionNumber":"4638540","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Dec. 1993","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A conceptual model of a single-event gate-rupture in power MOSFETs","sourcePdf":"00273457.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.060903S","chronDate":"Dec.  1993","isNumber":"6769","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"73","articleId":"273457","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":273460,"authors":[{"name":"R.

The primary objectives of this study were to examine the extent of SMUs in SRAMs, determine design characteristics that predispose devices to this type of upset, and investigate SMU mitigation techniques applicable to space-based electronic systems. The results reported suggest that a nonnegligible SMU rate can be expected for most high-density SRAM types when exposed to the space radiation environment. However, the range of SMU rates is also very large, suggesting that careful selection of device types should be emphasized during the design phase. Furthermore, susceptibility to SEU is not necessarily a reliable indicator of SMU vulnerability. A more important determinant, in many cases, is the architecture of the device, especially the physical separation between logically adjacent cells. It is therefore inappropriate to consider SEU (single event upset) studies to be a proxy for SMU investigations.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/23.273460","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel1/23/6769/00273460.pdf","startPage":"1941","endPage":"1946","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/23.273460","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6769","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Single-word multiple-bit upsets in static random access devices","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=273460","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1993","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/273460/","displayDocTitle":"Single-word multiple-bit upsets in static random access devices","volume":"40","issue":"6","publicationDate":"Dec. 1993","accessionNumber":"4638537","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Single-word multiple-bit upsets in static random access devices","sourcePdf":"00273460.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.029009S","chronDate":"Dec.  1993","isNumber":"6769","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"28","articleId":"273460","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":273461,"authors":[{"name":"I.

Waveforms of the current transients induced by He-, C-, O- and Fe-ion strikes on silicon diodes were measured by applying extremely low beam currents of an order of 10 fA and a wide-bandwidth digitizing sampling technique. Total collected charges are evaluated from the transient currents as a function of LET (linear energy transfer), bias voltage, and doping level, and are compared with theoretical values calculated using conventional single-event models. It is found that irradiation effects on the total collected charges can be explained by the introduction of displacement atoms calculated using Coulomb potential and the Kinchin-Pease model.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel1/23/6769/00273461.pdf","startPage":"1935","endPage":"1940","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","doi":"10.1109/23.273461","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/23.273461","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6769","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=273461","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Single-event current transients induced by high energy ion microbeams","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Current measurement","Sampling methods","Single event upset","Bandwidth","Circuits","Silicon","Semiconductor diodes","Position measurement","Oscilloscopes","Energy measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["elemental semiconductors","ion beam effects","semiconductor device models","semiconductor diodes","silicon","transients"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high energy ion microbeams","single-event upset","current transients","silicon diodes","low beam currents","wide-bandwidth digitizing sampling technique","transient currents","LET","linear energy transfer","bias voltage","doping level","irradiation effects","displacement atoms","Coulomb potential","Kinchin-Pease model","10 fA"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/273461/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1993","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1993","displayDocTitle":"Single-event current transients induced by high energy ion microbeams","volume":"40","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 1993","accessionNumber":"4638536","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Single-event current transients induced by high energy ion microbeams","sourcePdf":"00273461.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034338S","chronDate":"Dec.  1993","isNumber":"6769","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"75","articleId":"273461","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":273462,"authors":[{"name":"H.

The simulations explore the effects of different ion track models, applied biases, background dopings and LET (linear energy transfer) on the transient responses of a p-n diode. The simulation results show that ion track structure and charge collection via diffusion-dominated processes play important roles in determining device transient responses. The simulations show no evidence of rapid charge collection in excess of that deposited in the device depletion region in typical funneling time frames. Further, the simulations clearly show that the device transient responses are not simple functions of the ion's incident LET. The simulation results imply that future studies should consider the effects of ion track structure and extend transient charge collection times to insure that reported charge collection efficiencies include diffusion-dominated collection processes.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/23.273462","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","startPage":"1926","endPage":"1934","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel1/23/6769/00273462.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/23.273462","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6769","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Numerical simulation of heavy ion charge generation and collection dynamics","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Numerical simulation","Discrete event simulation","Analytical models","Computational modeling","Physics","Diodes","Computer simulation","Transient analysis","Microelectronics","Single event upset"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["charge measurement","ion beam effects","semiconductor device testing","semiconductor diodes","transient response"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["heavy ion charge generation","single event transient","p-n diode","ion track models","applied biases","background dopings","LET","linear energy transfer","transient responses","diffusion-dominated processes","funneling time frames","ion track structure","transient charge collection"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1993","displayDocTitle":"Numerical simulation of heavy ion charge generation and collection dynamics","volume":"40","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4638535","publicationDate":"Dec. 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/273462/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Numerical simulation of heavy ion charge generation and collection dynamics","sourcePdf":"00273462.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.101702S","chronDate":"Dec.  1993","isNumber":"6769","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"49","articleId":"273462","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":273464,"authors":[{"name":"K.W.

It is valid for bulk technologies having a lightly doped epi region over a heavily doped substrate region. The proposed method is applied to 8 K*8 K SRAM (static random-access memory) heavy ion SEU (single event upset) test data. It is shown that the primary cause of discontinuities decreases in the upset cross section even though the surface normal effective LET has increased in the upset cross section versus surface normal effective LET curves. This is due to inappropriate conversion of the ion LET into surface normal effective LET. Previous attempts to resolve these discontinuities focused on modifying the upset cross section. The proposed model focuses on the conversion from ion LET to surface normal effective LET. The discontinuities are significantly reduced by modifying the traditionally used 1/cos conversion equation.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Determination of funnel length from cross section versus LET measurements","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","doi":"10.1109/23.273464","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel1/23/6769/00273464.pdf","startPage":"1910","endPage":"1917","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/23.273464","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6769","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=273464","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/273464/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1993","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1993","displayDocTitle":"Determination of funnel length from cross section versus LET measurements","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"40","issue":"6","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Dec. 1993","accessionNumber":"4638533","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Determination of funnel length from cross section versus LET measurements","sourcePdf":"00273464.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034287S","chronDate":"Dec.  1993","isNumber":"6769","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"30","articleId":"273464","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":273465,"authors":[{"name":"E.L.

The expression incorporates both the stochastics of the energy deposition process and the variability of the response of an array of memory cells. The energy deposition stochastics result from the distribution of path lengths the ion may take through a memory cell and the statistics of the charge production process. The variability in the memory response results from the dependence of the sensitive volume size on deposited charge and cell-to-cell variations due to processing. Thus the shape of a measured upset cross section curve is the result of the complex interplay of a number of physical processes whose relative contributions vary with experimental conditions, memory technology, and processing. A procedure for the separation of the basic memory response from the stochastics of the energy deposition process using heavy ion SEU measurements is given. This can be used to predict the SEU vulnerability in any radiation environment.

A direct, analytical relationship between the measured cross-section curves seen in contemporary SOI CMOS SRAMs and the distribution of the parasitic bipolar beta values controlling each cell critical charge is presented.

Quantitative charge-collection spectra from known regions of the memory cell have been derived using this technique. For 2.4-MeV He ions at normal incidence, charge collection depth for a reverse-biased p+ drain strike is estimated to be 4.8+or-0.4 mu m. Heavy-ion strikes to the reverse-biased p-well result in nearly complete collection of deposited charge to a depth of 5.5+or-0.5 mu m. A charge amplification effect in the n-on drain is identified and is due to either bipolar amplification or a shunt effect in the parasitic vertical npn bipolar transistor associated with the n+/n substrate, p-well, and n+drain. This effect is present only when the n+drain is at 0 V bias. When coupled with previous SEU-imaging, these results strongly suggest that the dominant SEU mechanism in this SRAM is a heavy-ion strike to the n-on transistor drain.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/23.273478","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel1/23/6769/00273478.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/23.273478","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6769","startPage":"1787","endPage":"1794","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Relationship between IBICC imaging and SEU in CMOS ICs","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=273478","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Relationship between IBICC imaging and SEU in CMOS ICs","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/273478/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1993","isJournal":true,"volume":"40","issue":"6","publicationDate":"Dec. 1993","accessionNumber":"4638519","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Relationship between IBICC imaging and SEU in CMOS ICs","sourcePdf":"00273478.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.057318S","chronDate":"Dec.  1993","isNumber":"6769","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"19","articleId":"273478","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":273482,"authors":[{"name":"W.L.

The four types of defect centers observed, charged oxygen vacancies, delocalized hole centers, amorphous-Si centers, and oxygen-related donors, are strikingly similar. In the BESOI materials, the radiation-induced EPR centers are located at or near the bonded interface. Therefore, the bonded interface is a potential hole trap site and may lead to radiation-induced back-channel leakage. In SIMOX materials, it is found that all of the defects in the buried oxide are due to excess Si. The results using poly-Si/thermal oxide/Si structures strongly suggest that it is the postimplantation, high-temperature anneal processing step in SIMOX that leads to their existence. The anneal leads to the out-diffusion of oxygen from the buried oxide, creating excess-Si related defects in the oxide and O-related donors in the underlying Si substrates. A relatively new class of defects in SiO/sub 2/, delocalized spin centers, are found to be hole traps in both SIMOX and BESOI materials.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Paramagnetic defect centers in BESOI and SIMOX buried oxides","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","doi":"10.1109/23.273482","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel1/23/6769/00273482.pdf","startPage":"1755","endPage":"1764","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/23.273482","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6769","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=273482","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/273482/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1993","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1993","displayDocTitle":"Paramagnetic defect centers in BESOI and SIMOX buried oxides","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"40","issue":"6","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Dec. 1993","accessionNumber":"4638515","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Paramagnetic defect centers in BESOI and SIMOX buried oxides","sourcePdf":"00273482.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.056163S","chronDate":"Dec.  1993","isNumber":"6769","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"63","articleId":"273482","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":273491,"authors":[{"name":"A.H.

The total-dose response is shown to depend strongly on transistor channel length. Specifically, transistors with shorter gate lengths tend to show more negative threshold-voltage shifts under irradiation than transistors with longer gate lengths. Similarly, transistors with longer gate lengths tend to show more positive threshold-voltage shifts during postirradiation annealing. It will be important to factor these differences in radiation response into test-structure-to-IC correlations necessary to support cost-effective qualified manufacturers list hardness assurance. Transistors with minimum gate length will have a larger effect on standby power supply current for an IC at high dose rates, such as in a weapon environment, where worst-case response is associated with negative threshold-voltage shifts during irradiation. On the other hand, transistors with maximum gate length will have a larger effect on the timing parameters of an IC at low dose rates, such as in a space environment.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/273493/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1993","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1993","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"40","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4638504","displayDocTitle":"Effects of device scaling and geometry on MOS radiation hardness assurance","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Effects of device scaling and geometry on MOS radiation hardness assurance","sourcePdf":"00273493.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.055099S","chronDate":"Dec.  1993","isNumber":"6769","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"34","articleId":"273493","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":273494,"authors":[{"name":"J.R.

Comparisons are shown for single-transistor midgap and charge-pumping measurements and dual-transistor-mobility measurements. When conventional analysis methods are used to determine threshold voltages, there can be as much as a factor-of-two-difference in the density of interface traps measured by charge pumping and the dual-transistor-mobility and midgap techniques. Using the voltage that corresponds to twice the bulk potential as the threshold voltage, better agreement between the three techniques is obtained.

The neural network implements a fully parallel architecture integrating 10240 analog nonvolatile synapses fabricated in a CMOS process. Graceful degradation of forward propagation performance was observed in units that were exposed to absorbed doses of up to 26 krads (Si) of 10-MeV electrons. The units were exposed without bias, except for that due to the floating gates. Single-chip solutions to two pattern recognition problems representing two levels of difficulty are employed for testing. Over the weeks following exposure, postirradiation effects due to a latent charge trapping mechanism in the oxides of the nonvolatile floating gate structures are observed.

It is determined that the surfaces of these insulators rise to many tens of kV in the Earth's electron belts unless sufficient conduction to the spacecraft frame is established. Secondary electron emission is not sufficient to hold the potential to low values. The dependence of charging on insulator thickness, electron energy spectra, and material properties is investigated.

The NIEL for electrons and protons has been calculated from the displacement threshold to 200 MeV. Convoluting the electron NIEL with the slowed down Compton secondary electron spectrum gives an effective NIEL for CO/sup 60/ gammas, enabling gamma-induced displacement damage to be correlated with particle results. The fluences of 1 MeV electrons equivalent to irradiation with 1 Mrad(Si) for Si, GaAs, and InP are given. Analytic proton NIEL calculations and results derived from the Monte Carlo TRIM agree exactly, as long as straggling is not significant. The NIEL calculations are compared with experimental proton and electron damage coefficients using solar cells as examples. A linear relationship is found between the NIEL and proton damage coefficients for Si, GaAs, and InP devices. For electrons, there appears to be a linear dependence for n-Si and n-GaAs, but for p-Si there is a quadratic relationship which decreases the damage coefficient at 1 MeV by a factor of approximately 10 below the value for n-Si.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/23.273529","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel1/23/6769/00273529.pdf","startPage":"1372","endPage":"1379","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6769","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/23.273529","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Damage correlations in semiconductors exposed to gamma, electron and proton radiations","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=273529","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1993","displayDocTitle":"Damage correlations in semiconductors exposed to gamma, electron and proton radiations","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/273529/","publicationDate":"Dec. 1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4638468","volume":"40","issue":"6","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1993","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Damage correlations in semiconductors exposed to gamma, electron and proton radiations","sourcePdf":"00273529.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.083113S","chronDate":"Dec.  1993","isNumber":"6769","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"410","articleId":"273529","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":273532,"authors":[{"name":"S.M.

The radiation damage was characterized by low-temperature photoluminescence (PL) measurements using 1.58 eV laser excitation, deep level transient spectroscopy and transport measurements. The observed decrease of trap concentration accompanied with an increase in PL intensity at lower fluences, an increase in the density of traps at higher fluences, and a fluence-dependent oscillatory PL intensity for acceptor levels indicate radiation-induced order at low fluences following by nonuniform reorganization of defects with radiation in GaAs.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/23.273532","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel1/23/6769/00273532.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/23.273532","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6769","startPage":"1350","endPage":"1359","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Electron and neutron radiation-induced order effect in gallium arsenide","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=273532","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Electron and neutron radiation-induced order effect in gallium arsenide","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/273532/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1993","isJournal":true,"volume":"40","issue":"6","publicationDate":"Dec. 1993","accessionNumber":"4638465","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Electron and neutron radiation-induced order effect in gallium arsenide","sourcePdf":"00273532.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.062594S","chronDate":"Dec.  1993","isNumber":"6769","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"31","articleId":"273532","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":273533,"authors":[{"name":"N.S.

Large increases in D/sub it/ are observed during H/sub 2/ annealing in MOSFETs previously stressed by either /sup 60/Co irradiation or Fowler-Nordheim electron injection. The annealing behavior is very similar for both types of stress, and this suggests that the D/sub it/ creation mechanism involves similar chemistry for hydrogen reactions. Studies of the time dependence of D/sub it/ creation as a function of MOSFET gate length show that the time dependence is limited primarily by lateral diffusion of molecular hydrogen through the gate oxide. An activation energy of 0.57 eV, which is consistent with H/sub 2/ diffusion, is obtained from the temperature dependence.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1993","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/273533/","volume":"40","issue":"6","accessionNumber":"4638464","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Effects of post-stress hydrogen annealing on MOS oxides after /sup 60/Co irradiation or Fowler-Nordheim injection","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Effects of post-stress hydrogen annealing on MOS oxides after /sup 60/Co irradiation or Fowler-Nordheim injection","sourcePdf":"00273533.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037779S","chronDate":"Dec.  1993","isNumber":"6769","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"32","articleId":"273533","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":273535,"authors":[{"name":"D.M.

The midgap-voltage shift of these devices returns to approximately 0 V during a 2.75-year, +6 V 100 degrees C anneal, supporting the idea that in these devices interface traps and border traps (near-interfacial oxide traps which can exchange charge with the underlying Si) are charge-neutral at midgap. Subsequent switched-bias annealing reveals that a significant fraction of the radiation-induced trapped holes have not been removed from the device, but are compensated by electrons in border traps. These border traps can lead to large, reversible changes in midgap-voltage shifts and/or subthreshold stretchout during switched-bias anneals. Midgap-voltage and subthreshold-stretchout reversibility remains significant in these devices even after annealing at temperatures up to 350 degrees C. Similar reversibility in postirradiation response is observed for hardened transistors and capacitors. These results suggest that border traps may lead to increased reliability problems in some irradiated devices as compared to their unirradiated counterparts.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/23.273535","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel1/23/6769/00273535.pdf","startPage":"1323","endPage":"1334","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/23.273535","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6769","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The role of border traps in MOS high-temperature postirradiation annealing response","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/273535/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1993","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1993","displayDocTitle":"The role of border traps in MOS high-temperature postirradiation annealing response","volume":"40","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 1993","accessionNumber":"4638462","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The role of border traps in MOS high-temperature postirradiation annealing response","sourcePdf":"00273535.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.048454S","chronDate":"Dec.  1993","isNumber":"6769","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"67","articleId":"273535","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":273536,"authors":[{"name":"R.K.

Heavy ion and proton testing of the same devices is reported, and predictions using LET (linear energy transfer)-dependent ion cross sections and a two-parameter fit to proton cross section data are compared with in-flight data. SEU trends in memory devices from a single manufacturer, from 16 kb to 4 Mb, are identified. The increasing density of the memories is found to be accompanied by an apparent decreasing sensitivity to the heavy ion environment in polar orbit. Although the LET threshold decreases, the decrease in asymptotic cross section has a greater effect. However, the sensitivity to proton-induced upsets is nearly similar in all memories, so the proton effects become dominant by an order of magnitude.

These fluctuations take the form of RTSs with well-defined amplitudes and time constants for the high and low dark current states.

Annealing of the RTS defect was found to occur at approximately 100 degrees C.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/23.273552","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel1/23/6769/00273552.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/23.273552","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6769","startPage":"1567","endPage":"1574","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Random telegraph signals from proton-irradiated CCDs","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=273552","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Random telegraph signals from proton-irradiated CCDs","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/273552/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1993","isJournal":true,"volume":"40","issue":"6","publicationDate":"Dec. 1993","accessionNumber":"4644716","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Random telegraph signals from proton-irradiated CCDs","sourcePdf":"00273552.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034198S","chronDate":"Dec.  1993","isNumber":"6769","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"74","articleId":"273552","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-28"},{"_id":273553,"authors":[{"name":"M.

In this failure mechanism, damage accumulates with each load cycle, thereby causing a physical wearout failure mechanism. Phenomenological continuum length-scale models, based on micromechanical considerations, are presented to predict the onset (or initiation) of fatigue cracking in ductile materials. Fatigue crack propagation is modeled with continuum fracture mechanics principles. The number of load cycles required to cause failure is predicted based on these models. Approaches for modeling creep fatigue interactions are briefly discussed. Analytic physics-of-failure method and examples are presented for designing against wearout failure due to cyclic fatigue. These models can be implemented in an engineering design environment. The associated stress analysis requires numerical finite element techniques in many cases. The associated material property characterization techniques have matured since the 1950s and are specified in engineering handbooks.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/24.273577","pdfPath":"/iel1/24/6770/00273577.pdf","startPage":"548","endPage":"555","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Reliability","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Reliability","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/24.273577","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6770","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Failure mechanism models for cyclic fatigue","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/273577/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1993","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1993","displayDocTitle":"Failure mechanism models for cyclic fatigue","volume":"42","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4671096","publicationDate":"Dec. 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Failure mechanism models for cyclic fatigue","sourcePdf":"00273577.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038272S","chronDate":"Dec 1993","isNumber":"6770","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"24","citationCount":"42","articleId":"273577","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":273583,"authors":[{"name":"J.-K.

A design scheme suggested to maximize the probability of achieving a specified stochastic cycle availability with respect to the duration of the operating interval between PMs. Numerical computations of the results for Weibull-like distributions illustrate the design criteria.

An analysis of these modulation techniques along with the implementation scheme using a microcontroller is presented in this paper.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/273625/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan/Feb 1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan/Feb 1994","volume":"30","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan.-Feb. 1994","accessionNumber":"4644928","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","displayDocTitle":"New modulation encoding techniques for indirect rotor position sensing in switched reluctance motors","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"New modulation encoding techniques for indirect rotor position sensing in switched reluctance motors","sourcePdf":"00273625.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.053535S","chronDate":"Jan/Feb 1994","isNumber":"6771","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"28","citationCount":"120","articleId":"273625","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":273627,"authors":[{"name":"P.L.

This paper presents a physics-based design methodology and uses it to evaluate open-loop observers and to develop a new closed-loop flux observer. It is shown that the new flux observer is a straightforward structure with properties that combine the best features of known methods. A distinction is made between observers, which use only integration and feedback summation operations, and those estimation methods requiring approximate differentiation which are, in essence, \"cancellation\" methods. Furthermore, a clear distinction is made between accuracy and dynamic robustness of the observer. This distinction is important because the accuracy of flux observers for induction machines is inherently parameter sensitive, whereas robustness of observers, in a controls sense, is not parameter sensitive. Moreover, it is shown how flux observers can provide robust field oriented control because the flux angle is substantially more correct than the flux magnitude. A distinctive form of frequency response function (FRF) analysis similar to that used in classical control engineering is demonstrated to be a useful and insightful tool even though flux observers are multiple-input, multiple-output systems. Finally, the limits of such flux observers are experimentally evaluated.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A physically insightful approach to the design and accuracy assessment of flux observers for field oriented induction machine drives","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","doi":"10.1109/28.273627","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","pdfPath":"/iel1/28/6771/00273627.pdf","startPage":"101","endPage":"110","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/28.273627","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6771","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=273627","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/273627/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan/Feb 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan/Feb 1994","displayDocTitle":"A physically insightful approach to the design and accuracy assessment of flux observers for field oriented induction machine drives","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"30","issue":"1","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Jan.-Feb. 1994","accessionNumber":"4644930","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A physically insightful approach to the design and accuracy assessment of flux observers for field oriented induction machine drives","sourcePdf":"00273627.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047093S","chronDate":"Jan/Feb 1994","isNumber":"6771","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"28","citationCount":"326","articleId":"273627","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":273630,"authors":[{"name":"N.

Measured line current and terminal voltage are used to estimate the flux linkage of the motor. The algorithm has a two current-loop structure, with the outer loop used to correct the position, and the inner loop utilised to correct the estimated flux linkage. The theoretical basis of the algorithm and individual definition of the system blocks is explained. Dependencies on motor parameters and measurement errors are discussed to show the effectiveness of the method using real data. As well as giving a detailed explanation of the new algorithm, the paper presents a wide range of computed and experimental results, demonstrating the reliability of the method even during acceleration of the motor from rest.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","pdfPath":"/iel1/28/6771/00273630.pdf","startPage":"126","endPage":"133","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","doi":"10.1109/28.273630","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/28.273630","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6771","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=273630","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new algorithm for sensorless operation of permanent magnet motors","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Permanent magnet motors","Brushless DC motors","DC motors","Reluctance motors","Voltage","Shafts","Stators","Mechanical sensors","Couplings","Rotors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["permanent magnet motors","magnetic flux","parameter estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["algorithm","sensorless operation","permanent magnet motors","flux linkage estimation","line current estimation","line current","terminal voltage","two current-loop structure","outer loop","inner loop","measurement errors"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/273630/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan/Feb 1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan/Feb 1994","displayDocTitle":"A new algorithm for sensorless operation of permanent magnet motors","volume":"30","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan.-Feb. 1994","accessionNumber":"4644933","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new algorithm for sensorless operation of permanent magnet motors","sourcePdf":"00273630.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036254S","chronDate":"Jan/Feb 1994","isNumber":"6771","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"28","citationCount":"171","articleId":"273630","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":273635,"authors":[{"name":"R.

Recent investigations by the author and others have shown that during overloads there is a time lag between the top oil temperature rise and the oil temperature rise in the winding cooling ducts. This phenomena results in winding hottest spot temperatures greater than predicted by the current (1981) IEEE Loading Guide equations. Accurate predictions of the winding hottest spot temperature requires the use of the temperature of the oil entering and exiting the winding cooling ducts. Low flammability liquids such as silicone or high temperature hydrocarbons are not covered in the present Loading Guide. Resistance change with temperature and liquid viscosity are not considered in current Loading Guide equations. Loading Guide equations also assume a constant ambient air temperature during a load cycle. Improved loading equations based on analysis and testing are presented in this paper. The improved equations consider type of liquid, cooling mode, winding duct oil temperature rise, resistance and viscosity changes, and ambient temperature and load changes during a load cycle. A PC BASIC computer program to perform the calculations was developed and will be included in the next edition of the IEEE Loading Guide for Mineral Oil Immersed Transformers.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/28.273636","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","pdfPath":"/iel1/28/6771/00273636.pdf","startPage":"170","endPage":"178","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/28.273636","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6771","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=273636","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Predicting liquid filled transformer loading capability","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Predicting liquid filled transformer loading capability","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/273636/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan/Feb 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan/Feb 1994","volume":"30","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Jan.-Feb. 1994","accessionNumber":"4644939","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Predicting liquid filled transformer loading capability","sourcePdf":"00273636.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.026362S","chronDate":"Jan/Feb 1994","isNumber":"6771","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"28","citationCount":"86","articleId":"273636","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2022-01-15"},{"_id":273648,"authors":[{"name":"T.

The conductivity of ACAF materials is only in the Z-direction (perpendicular to the plane of the board), and electrical isolation is maintained in the X-Y plane. Currently, at least 15 ACAF materials are commercially available. The authors have developed a methodology for evaluating these materials for their mechanical and electrical properties and interconnection use in the 8 to 15-mil pitch range. In addition they characterized the materials according to their physical properties and cure characteristics.

Eight commercial electrically conductive adhesive pastes for solder replacement in surface mount technology (SMT) and other microelectronic applications were selected for study, including both thermosetting and thermoplastic examples. All were silver based, except for one nickel-polymer composite. The properties on which this work was focused were the microstructure and electrical characteristics, with the specific purpose of determining the conduction mechanisms. The electrical measurements established that the primary source of electrical resistance is in the silver particles, with negligible contact effects between them. Differential scanning calorimetry results indicated that drifts in the electrical properties are not attributable to incomplete cures.

The attractive features of these polynomials for Vision is discussed.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Describing complicated objects by implicit polynomials","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","doi":"10.1109/34.273718","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel1/34/6774/00273718.pdf","startPage":"38","endPage":"53","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/34.273718","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6774","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=273718","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/273718/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1994","displayDocTitle":"Describing complicated objects by implicit polynomials","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"16","issue":"1","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Jan. 1994","accessionNumber":"4645052","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Describing complicated objects by implicit polynomials","sourcePdf":"00273718.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.102825S","chronDate":"Jan 1994","isNumber":"6774","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"131","articleId":"273718","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":273720,"authors":[{"name":"Jin-Yinn Wang","affiliation":["Department of Information Science, Chung Cheng Institute of Technology, Taoyuan, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Jin-Yinn Wang","id":"37087895937"},{"name":"F.S.

I, see ibid., p.1-12 (1994). This paper is the second part of a 3-D object recognition and shape estimation system that identifies particular objects by recognizing the special markings (text, symbols, drawings, etc.) on their surfaces. The shape of the object is identified from the image curves using B-spline curve modeling as described in Part I, as well as a binocular stereo imaging system. This is achieved by first estimating the 3-D control points from the corresponding curves in each image in the stereo imaging system. From the 3-D control points, the 3-D object curves are generated, and these are subsequently used for estimating the 3-D surface parameters. A Bayesian framework is used for classifying the image into one of c possible surfaces based on the extracted 3-D object curves. This is complemented by a neural network (NN) that recognizes the surface as a particular object (e.g., a Pepsi can versus a peanut butter jar), by reading the text/markings on the surface. To reduce the amount of training the NN has to undergo for recognition, the object curves are \"unwarped\" into planar curves before the matching process. This eliminates the need for templates that are surface shape dependent and results in a planar curve that might be a rotated, translated, and scaled version of the template. Hence, for the matching process we need to use measures that are invariant to these transformations. One such measure is the Fourier descriptors (FD) derived from the control points associated with the unwarped parent curves. The approach is tried on a variety of images of real objects and appears to hold great promise.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/34.273720","startPage":"13","endPage":"23","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel1/34/6774/00273720.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/34.273720","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6774","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Part II: 3-D object recognition and shape estimation from image contours using B-splines, shape invariant matching, and neural network","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Object recognition","Spline","Neural networks","Reflectivity","Image recognition","Text recognition","Shape control","Machine vision","Decoding","Control systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["splines (mathematics)","neural nets","image recognition","Bayes methods","stereo image processing","image sequences"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3-D object recognition","shape estimation","image contours","B-splines","shape invariant matching","neural network","image curves","curve modeling","binocular stereo imaging system","Bayesian framework","training","matching","Fourier descriptors","unwarped parent curves"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/273720/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1994","displayDocTitle":"Part II: 3-D object recognition and shape estimation from image contours using B-splines, shape invariant matching, and neural network","volume":"16","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4645050","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Part II: 3-D object recognition and shape estimation from image contours using B-splines, shape invariant matching, and neural network","sourcePdf":"00273720.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044334S","chronDate":"Jan 1994","isNumber":"6774","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"34","articleId":"273720","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":273730,"authors":[{"name":"Jia-Lin Chen","affiliation":["Faculty of Computer Science, Chung Hua Polytechnic Institute, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Jia-Lin Chen","id":"37384640200"},{"name":"A.

In the second stage, the sequence of subbands is modeled as a hidden Markov model (HMM), and one HMM is designed for each class of textures. The HMM is used to exploit the dependence among these subbands, and is able to capture the trend of changes caused by rotation.

In this method, a continuous sequence of images is taken as an object rotates. A smooth convex shape can be estimated instantaneously from its contour and by the first derivative of contour movement (trace of contour, or contour distribution with time). We also analyze shapes that do not satisfy the conditions of smoothness and visibility, which are indispensable for modeling an object. A region that does not expose as contour yields a nonsmoothness in the tracked contour movement. We can thus detect such a region by contour distribution filtering and extract its accurate location by computing the left and right derivatives of the distribution. This has not been studied previously. These unknown regions are obtained for further investigation using other visual cues. A general approach for building a geometrical object model using contours is then described. The entire process from silhouettes to a 3-D model is based local computation; this is promising for producing shapes in real time. Our direct goal is to establish 3-D graphics models of human faces for the growing needs of visual communications. We have obtained some good results.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/273734/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1994","volume":"16","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 1994","accessionNumber":"4645065","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","displayDocTitle":"Acquiring 3-D models from sequences of contours","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Acquiring 3-D models from sequences of contours","sourcePdf":"00273734.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.147715S","chronDate":"Feb 1994","isNumber":"6775","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"95","articleId":"273734","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":273735,"authors":[{"name":"A.

In general, identifying a nonconvex object using a silhouette-based approach implies neglecting some features of its surface as identification clues. The same features cannot be reconstructed by volume intersection techniques using multiple silhouettes of the object. This paper addresses the problem of finding which parts of a nonconvex object are relevant for silhouette-based image understanding. For this purpose, the geometric concept of visual hull of a 3-D object is introduced. This is the closest approximation of object S that can be obtained with the volume intersection approach; it is the maximal object silhouette-equivalent to S, i.e., which can be substituted for S without affecting any silhouette. Only the parts of the surface of S that also lie on the surface of the visual hull can be reconstructed or identified using silhouette-based algorithms. The visual hull depends not only on the object but also on the region allowed to the viewpoint. Two main viewing regions result in the external and internal visual hull. In the former case the viewing region is related to the convex hull of S, in the latter it is bounded by S. The internal visual hull also admits an interpretation not related to silhouettes. Algorithms for computing visual hulls are presented and their complexity analyzed. In general, the visual hull of a 3-D planar face object turns out to be bounded by planar and curved patches.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/34.273735","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel1/34/6775/00273735.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/34.273735","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6775","startPage":"150","endPage":"162","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The visual hull concept for silhouette-based image understanding","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=273735","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"The visual hull concept for silhouette-based image understanding","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/273735/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1994","isJournal":true,"volume":"16","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 1994","accessionNumber":"4645064","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The visual hull concept for silhouette-based image understanding","sourcePdf":"00273735.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.080485S","chronDate":"Feb 1994","isNumber":"6775","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"834","articleId":"273735","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":273736,"authors":[{"name":"D.

Although these schemes show promise, and although some analytical work has been done, the relationship between texture differences and the filter configurations required to distinguish them remain largely unknown. This paper examines the issue of designing individual filters. Using a 2-D texture model, we show analytically that applying a properly configured bandpass filter to a textured image produces distinct output discontinuities at texture boundaries; the analysis is based on Gabor elementary functions, but it is the bandpass nature of the filter that is essential. Depending on the type of texture difference, these discontinuities form one of four characteristic signatures: a step, ridge, valley, or a step change in average local output variation. Accompanying experimental evidence indicates that these signatures are useful for segmenting an image. The analysis indicates those texture characteristics that are responsible for each signature type. Detailed criteria are provided for designing filters that can produce quality output signatures. We also illustrate occasions when asymmetric filters are beneficial, an issue not previously addressed.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/34.273736","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6775","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/34.273736","endPage":"149","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel1/34/6775/00273736.pdf","startPage":"130","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Texture segmentation using 2-D Gabor elementary functions","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/273736/","displayDocTitle":"Texture segmentation using 2-D Gabor elementary functions","volume":"16","issue":"2","accessionNumber":"4645063","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Feb. 1994","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Texture segmentation using 2-D Gabor elementary functions","sourcePdf":"00273736.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.076138S","chronDate":"Feb 1994","isNumber":"6775","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"203","articleId":"273736","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-23"},{"_id":273743,"authors":[{"name":"F.

We present a technique which allows for the verification of a specific class of systems, namely systems with synchronous globally timed control. To a first approximation, these are systems where a single controller directs the data through the data path and decides (globally) when to move the data. We address the verification of these systems against a Signal Flow Graph (SFG) specification, or a specification in an applicative language such as SILAGE. In this paper, a method is presented for verifying the implementation against an intermediate SFG, which is an expansion of the original specification in such a way that all the operations correspond to Register Transfers (RT's) in the implementation. In this SFG, complex arithmetic operations such as multiplications may have been decomposed into simpler ones, such as shifts and additions, and new operations may have been introduced for maintaining iteration indices and computing addresses of memory locations. SFG's can be viewed as maximally parallel synchronous machines. Both the implementation and the specification are then Finite State Machines, having string functions (input/output mappings) associated with them. Correctness is taken to mean that a certain relation (the /spl beta/-relation) holds between these string functions.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/273743/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","publicationDate":"Jan. 1994","accessionNumber":"4619828","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","volume":"13","issue":"1","displayDocTitle":"Event-based verification of synchronous, globally controlled, logic designs against signal flow graphs","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Event-based verification of synchronous, globally controlled, logic designs against signal flow graphs","sourcePdf":"00273743.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.049471S","chronDate":"Jan 1994","isNumber":"6776","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"4","articleId":"273743","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":273746,"authors":[{"name":"J.S.

Experimental results for industrial circuits indicate that the new technique can be 10 and 50 times faster than the convolution and lumped-RLC methods, respectively, for long simulations.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Algorithms for the transient simulation of lossy interconnect","doi":"10.1109/43.273746","endPage":"104","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel1/43/6776/00273746.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","startPage":"96","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/43.273746","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6776","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=273746","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Convolution","Circuit simulation","Frequency","Computational modeling","Integrated circuit interconnections","Propagation losses","Dielectric losses","Distributed parameter circuits","Power system transients","Analytical models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["transmission line theory","transient response","linear network analysis","circuit analysis computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["transient simulation","lossy interconnect","linear-time technique","lossy transmission lines","frequency-independent lossy line","numerical convolution formulae","industrial circuits","state-based method","raytheon circuits","impulse response"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Algorithms for the transient simulation of lossy interconnect","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/273746/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1994","volume":"13","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4619825","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Algorithms for the transient simulation of lossy interconnect","sourcePdf":"00273746.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.040287S","chronDate":"Jan 1994","isNumber":"6776","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"34","articleId":"273746","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":273749,"authors":[{"name":"K.J.

It is based on a new concept for specification analysis that provides exact worst-case transistor model parameters and exact worst-case operating conditions. Corresponding worst-case distances provide a key measure for the performance, the yield, and the robustness of a circuit. A new deterministic method for parametric circuit design that is based on worst-case distances is presented. It comprises nominal design, worst-case analysis, yield optimization, and design centering. In contrast to current approaches, it uses standard circuit simulators and at the same time considers deterministic design parameters of integrated circuits at reasonable computational costs. The most serious disadvantage of geometric approaches to design centering is eliminated, as the method's complexity increases only linearly with the number of design variables.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/273749/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1994","volume":"13","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"4619822","publicationDate":"Jan. 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Circuit analysis and optimization driven by worst-case distances","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Circuit analysis and optimization driven by worst-case distances","sourcePdf":"00273749.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.054504S","chronDate":"Jan 1994","isNumber":"6776","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"146","articleId":"273749","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":273753,"authors":[{"name":"M.

It has the capability of producing compact designs (minimizing the number of cells (CLB's)), as well as the flexibility of trading routability with compactness of a design. Research in this area has focussed on minimizing the number of cells. However, minimizing the number of cells without regard to routability is ineffective. Since placement and routing is really the most time-consuming part of the FPGA design process, producing a routable design with a slightly larger number of cells is preferable than producing a design using fewer cells which is difficult to route, or in the worst case unroutable. We have implemented our algorithm in the Rmap program, and studied routability of two other mappers with respect to Rmap. Rmap produces mappings with better routability characteristics, and more significantly Rmap produces routable mappings when other mappers do not.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel1/43/6776/00273753.pdf","startPage":"13","endPage":"26","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/43.273753","doi":"10.1109/43.273753","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6776","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Routability-driven technology mapping for lookup table-based FPGA's","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1994","displayDocTitle":"Routability-driven technology mapping for lookup table-based FPGA's","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/273753/","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Jan. 1994","accessionNumber":"4619818","volume":"13","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1994","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Routability-driven technology mapping for lookup table-based FPGA's","sourcePdf":"00273753.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.046444S","chronDate":"Jan 1994","isNumber":"6776","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"36","articleId":"273753","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":273754,"authors":[{"name":"J.

In the past few years, a number of heuristic algorithms have been proposed for technology mapping in lookup-table (LUT) based FPGA designs, but none of them guarantees optimal solutions for general Boolean networks and little is known about how far their solutions are away from the optimal ones. This paper presents a theoretical breakthrough which shows that the LUT-based FPGA technology mapping problem for depth minimization can be solved optimally in polynomial time. A key step in our algorithm is to compute a minimum height K-feasible cut in a network, which is solved optimally in polynomial time based on network flow computation. Our algorithm also effectively minimizes the number of LUT's by maximizing the volume of each cut and by several post-processing operations. Based on these results, we have implemented an LUT-based FPGA mapping package called FlowMap. We have tested FlowMap on a large set of benchmark examples and compared it with other LUT-based FPGA mapping algorithms for delay optimization, including Chortle-d, MIS-pga-delay, and DAG-Map. FlowMap reduces the LUT network depth by up to 7% and reduces the number of LUT's by up to 50% compared to the three previous methods.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/43.273754","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel1/43/6776/00273754.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"12","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/43.273754","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6776","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FlowMap: an optimal technology mapping algorithm for delay optimization in lookup-table based FPGA designs","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1994","displayDocTitle":"FlowMap: an optimal technology mapping algorithm for delay optimization in lookup-table based FPGA designs","volume":"13","issue":"1","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4619817","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/273754/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1994","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FlowMap: an optimal technology mapping algorithm for delay optimization in lookup-table based FPGA designs","sourcePdf":"00273754.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.056784S","chronDate":"Jan 1994","isNumber":"6776","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"328","articleId":"273754","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":273787,"authors":[{"name":"K.

They show that the set of feasible solutions can be more thoroughly searched by requiring the genetic population to remain in the set of feasible solutions and propose adopting a weighted average rule for combining parent gene strings in genetic crossover. Because the set of feasible solutions is convex, the population remains feasible. Unfortunately, this technique does not extend to the general case of nonlinear constraints. The purpose of this paper is to present a general technique by which a population can be restricted to a set of feasible solutions, even when the constraints are nonlinear.

This is the 'permutation' or 'competing conventions' problem: similar nets may have the hidden units defined in different orders so that they have very dissimilar genetic strings, preventing successful recombination of building blocks. Previous empirical tests of a number of recombination operators using a simulated net-building task indicated the superiority of one that sorts hidden unit definitions by overlap prior to crossover. However, simple crossover also fared well, suggesting that the permutation problem is not serious in practice. This is supported by an observed reduction in performance when the permutation problem is removed. The GA is shown to be able to resolve the permutations, so that the advantages of an increase in the number of maxima outweigh the difficulties of recombination.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/273944/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6 Jun 1992","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"6-6 June 1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1992","accessionNumber":"4487950","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Genetic algorithms and permutation problems: a comparison of recombination operators for neural net structure specification","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Genetic algorithms and permutation problems: a comparison of recombination operators for neural net structure specification","confLoc":"Baltimore, MD, USA","sourcePdf":"00273944.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042586S","chronDate":"6 Jun 1992","isNumber":"6782","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"893","citationCount":"49","articleId":"273944","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":273946,"authors":[{"name":"D.

The novelty of this new genetic approach is that it can determine the network structures and their weights solely by an evolutionary process. This is made possible for the SGA primarily due to its redundant genetic material and a gene activation mechanism which in combination provide a multi-layered structure to the chromosome. The authors focus on the use of this learning algorithm for automatic generation of a complete application specific neural network. With this approach, no a priori assumptions about topology are needed and the only information required is the input and output characteristics of the task. The empirical studies show that the SGA can efficiently determine the network size and topology along with the optimal set of connection weights appropriate for desired tasks, without using backpropagation or any other learning algorithm.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/273946/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6 Jun 1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1992","accessionNumber":"4487948","conferenceDate":"6-6 June 1992","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Designing application-specific neural networks using the structured genetic algorithm","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Designing application-specific neural networks using the structured genetic algorithm","confLoc":"Baltimore, MD, USA","sourcePdf":"00273946.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058818S","chronDate":"6 Jun 1992","isNumber":"6782","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"893","citationCount":"55","articleId":"273946","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":273947,"authors":[{"name":"K.

Neural networks both involve an architecture that is a graph of connections, and a set of weights. The algorithm that is put forward yields both the architecture and the weights by using chromosomes that encode an algorithmic description based upon a cell rewriting grammar. The developmental process interprets the grammar for l cycles and develops a neural net parametrized by l. The encoding along with the developmental process have been designed in order to improve the existing approaches. They implement the following key-properties. The representation on the chromosome is abstract and compact. Any chromosome develops a valid phenotype. The developmental process gives modular and interpretable architectures with a powerful scalability property. The GA finds a neural net for the 50 inputs parity function, and for the 40 inputs symmetry function.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/COGANN.1992.273948","pdfPath":"/iel2/893/6782/00273948.pdf","startPage":"55","endPage":"74","displayPublicationTitle":"[Proceedings] COGANN-92: International Workshop on Combinations of Genetic Algorithms and Neural Networks","publicationTitle":"[Proceedings] COGANN-92: International Workshop on Combinations of Genetic Algorithms and Neural Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/COGANN.1992.273948","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6782","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Genetic synthesis of Boolean neural networks with a cell rewriting developmental process","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/273948/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6 Jun 1992","displayDocTitle":"Genetic synthesis of Boolean neural networks with a cell rewriting developmental process","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4487946","publicationDate":"1992","conferenceDate":"6-6 June 1992","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Genetic synthesis of Boolean neural networks with a cell rewriting developmental process","confLoc":"Baltimore, MD, USA","sourcePdf":"00273948.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.028233S","chronDate":"6 Jun 1992","isNumber":"6782","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"893","citationCount":"63","articleId":"273948","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":273949,"authors":[{"name":"J.G.

The network architecture is completely specified by a list of addresses that are used to connect signal sources to specific artificial synapses, which have both a temporal and spatial significance. The number of different connection patterns is a combinational problem which grows factorially as the number of artificial synapses in the network and the number of sensor elements increases. The network is implemented primarily in analog electronic hardware and constructed from artificial dendritic trees which exhibit a spatiotemporal processing capability that is modeled after morphologically complex biological neurons.

Experimental results are also described.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Noise reduction techniques for an ECL-CMOS RAM with a 2 ns write cycle time","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 1992 Bipolar/BiCMOS Circuits and Technology Meeting","doi":"10.1109/BIPOL.1992.274057","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 1992 Bipolar/BiCMOS Circuits and Technology Meeting","pdfPath":"/iel2/1026/6784/00274057.pdf","startPage":"174","endPage":"177","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BIPOL.1992.274057","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6784","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=274057","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/274057/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-8 Oct 1992","displayDocTitle":"Noise reduction techniques for an ECL-CMOS RAM with a 2 ns write cycle time","conferenceDate":"7-8 Oct. 1992","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1992","accessionNumber":"4575409","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Noise reduction techniques for an ECL-CMOS RAM with a 2 ns write cycle time","confLoc":"Minneapolis, MN, USA","sourcePdf":"00274057.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066184S","chronDate":"7-8 Oct 1992","isNumber":"6784","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1026","citationCount":"5","articleId":"274057","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":274060,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The various parasitics of devices and interconnects and their impact on circuit performance are reviewed. Within a given technology, there are a number of steps that can be taken to minimize the effects of parasitics and thereby maximize fast signal performance. These steps involve the approximate layout and sizing of individual devices, as well as floorplanning and routing of the functional blocks. Circuit design also plays a critical role in this context.

These differ from the short-time Fourier transform, wavelet transform, and wavelet packets tilings in that they change over time. It is shown how orthonormal tilings can be achieved using time-varying orthogonal tree structures, which preserve orthogonality, even across transitions. One method is based on lapped orthogonal transforms, which makes it possible to change the number of channels in the transform. A second method is based on the construction of boundary filters and gives arbitrary tilings. An algorithm is presented which for a given signal decides on the best binary segmentation and which tree split to use for each segment. It is optimal in a rate-distortion sense. The results of experiments on test signals are presented.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6785","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TFTSA.1992.274244","publicationTitle":"[1992] Proceedings of the IEEE-SP International Symposium on Time-Frequency and Time-Scale Analysis","displayPublicationTitle":"[1992] Proceedings of the IEEE-SP International Symposium on Time-Frequency and Time-Scale Analysis","pdfPath":"/iel2/1030/6785/00274244.pdf","startPage":"11","endPage":"14","doi":"10.1109/TFTSA.1992.274244","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Arbitrary orthogonal tilings of the time-frequency plane","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 Oct 1992","displayDocTitle":"Arbitrary orthogonal tilings of the time-frequency plane","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"4-6 Oct. 1992","publicationDate":"1992","accessionNumber":"4575449","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/274244/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Arbitrary orthogonal tilings of the time-frequency plane","confLoc":"Victoria, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"00274244.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.030377S","chronDate":"4-6 Oct 1992","isNumber":"6785","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1030","citationCount":"18","articleId":"274244","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":274246,"authors":[{"name":"A.C.

The ESA uses Psi to demodulate noisy AM-FM signals. The performance of Psi and the ESA when applied to bandpass noisy AM-FM signals is examined. The predicted performance is found to be greatly improved if the local signal frequencies occur within the filter passband. Using this observation, a multiband energy operator and ESA approach are devised.

The dynamics of the coding (C-) and decoding (D-) CNNs are described by generalized CNN state equations. The C-CNN encodes the image by structural compression and halftoning. The D-CNN decodes the received data through a reconstruction process so as to almost recognize the original input to the C-CNN. The importance of the compression and quantization technique lies in the ability to make the computations with only local connections. A dynamic quantization is performed in the C-CNN to decide the binary value of each pixel from the neighboring values. In order to reduce the error between the original gray image and the reconstructed halftone image, the template synthesis problem is addressed from the viewpoint of energy minimization. The structural compression template synthesis problem is discussed from the viewpoints of topological and regularization theories.

Consequently, loop shaping problems can be solved by efficient numerical methods. In particular, it can be determined whether or not a compensator exists that satisfies a given set of loop shaping specifications. Loop shaping design problems that are formulated as classical optimization problems, e.g., maximizing bandwidth subject to given margin and cutoff specifications, can be solved by direct numerical methods for quasiconvex optimization. A consequence of these observations is that closed-loop convex design methods can be used to do compensator design in a classical loop shaping framework which is familiar to many control engineers.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/CACSD.1992.274446","publicationTitle":"IEEE Symposium on Computer-Aided Control System Design","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Symposium on Computer-Aided Control System Design","pdfPath":"/iel2/1139/6790/00274446.pdf","startPage":"76","endPage":"81","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CACSD.1992.274446","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6790","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Interactive loop-shaping design of MIMO controllers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=274446","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 Mar 1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/274446/","displayDocTitle":"Interactive loop-shaping design of MIMO controllers","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1992","accessionNumber":"4589934","conferenceDate":"17-19 March 1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Interactive loop-shaping design of MIMO controllers","confLoc":"Napa, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00274446.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04183S","chronDate":"17-19 Mar 1992","isNumber":"6790","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1139","citationCount":"3","articleId":"274446","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":274940,"authors":[{"name":"N.G.

Some of the challenges in designing software for mobile computing systems are quite different from those involved in the design of software for today's stationary networked systems. The authors focus on the issues pertinent to software designers without delving into the lower level details of the hardware realization of mobile computers. They look at some promising approaches under investigation and also consider their limitations. The many issues to be dealt with stem from three essential properties of mobile computing: communication, mobility, and portability. Of course, special-purpose systems may avoid some design pressures by doing without certain desirable properties. For instance portability would be less of a concern for mobile computers installed in the dashboards of cars than with hand-held mobile computers. However, the authors concentrate on the goal of large-scale, hand-held mobile computing as a way to reveal a wide assortment of issues.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/274999/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April  1994","volume":"27","issue":"4","accessionNumber":"4673964","publicationDate":"April 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"The challenges of mobile computing","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The challenges of mobile computing","sourcePdf":"00274999.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037259S","chronDate":"April  1994","isNumber":"6813","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"2","citationCount":"408","articleId":"274999","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":275183,"authors":[{"name":"K.

They are also often very expensive. This paper describes a laboratory configuration and a set of tools designed and implemented at the University of the West Indies for undergraduate instruction in electronic instrumentation. The laboratory configuration encompasses a number of personal computer (PC) stations and model engineering systems. The model systems mimic realistic engineering processes under interrogation and control from the remote PC stations. A set of inexpensive hardware tools for data acquisition and control of the model systems, as well as for general laboratory test and measurement, are described.

Each station has an 80386-based microcomputer, a five degree-of-freedom robot arm, a video-rate vision system, and a speech synthesis system. The robot arms are capable of teach-pendant operation or control via the attached computer. Programs written in the robot control language can be downloaded into, stored in, and run from robot RAM. For greater flexibility, move instructions can be generated by the controlling computer (in any desired computer language) and transmitted to the arm for execution via an RS-232 link. Each joint of the robot (plus the gripper) has a dedicated microprocessor for closed-loop servo operation utilizing incremental drive-motor shaft encoders and micro-switches for \"home\" locations. The vision system includes an RS170-compatible video camera, a PC-compatible frame grabber board, and a video monitor. This configuration permits the utilization of 2D and 3D vision feedback in the robot control process. The laboratory is used in support of undergraduate courses that cover such topics as robot kinematics and task planning, elementary machine vision, and artificial neural networks.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/13.275184","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Education","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Education","pdfPath":"/iel1/13/6816/00275184.pdf","startPage":"87","endPage":"90","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/13.275184","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6816","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An instructional robotics and machine vision laboratory","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/275184/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1994","displayDocTitle":"An instructional robotics and machine vision laboratory","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4644740","volume":"37","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Feb. 1994","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An instructional robotics and machine vision laboratory","sourcePdf":"00275184.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.030231S","chronDate":"Feb 1994","isNumber":"6816","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"13","citationCount":"13","articleId":"275184","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":275225,"authors":[{"name":"Jun-Ichi Matsuda","affiliation":["LSI Division, Semiconductor Business Headquarters, SANYO Electric Company Limited, Gunma, Japan"],"lastName":"Jun-Ichi Matsuda","id":"37386556900"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9383"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9646"}],"articleNumber":"275225","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":360},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Electron Devices Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/eds/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=275225","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Capacitance measurement","Current measurement","Leakage current","Capacitors","Random access memory","Electric variables","MOSFET circuits","Electrodes","Electric variables measurement","Shape measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["capacitance measurement","electric current measurement","DRAM chips","cellular arrays","MOS integrated circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["leakage currents","capacitance","storage capacitor","single DRAM cell","electrode shape","plate electrode","MOSFET","transistor parameter analyzer","capacitance meter","linear region characteristics","subthreshold region characteristics","large area planar capacitor","0.1 fA","37.5 fF"]}],"abstract":"Methods of measuring leakage currents and the capacitance of the storage capacitor in a single DRAM cell have been developed for correlation with the electrode shape of the capacitor. In the circuit used for these measurements, the plate electrode of the storage capacitor is connected to the gate of the MOSFET which amplifies the voltage variations of the storage capacitor during the measurements. Here, only a conventional transistor parameter analyzer and a capacitance meter are required for the measurements. For the capacitance measurement, the linear region characteristics of the MOSFET are used to simplify the analysis. For the leakage current measurement, however, the subthreshold region characteristics of the MOSFET are used to enhance the accuracy of the measurement. The results show that the very low leakage currents (down to below 0.1 fA) and the capacitance (37.5 fF) of the storage capacitor can be measured accurately. Further, the leakage current-voltage characteristics of the storage capacitor are discussed by comparing with those of a large area planar capacitor whose structure is the same as the storage capacitor.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/16.275225","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel1/16/6817/00275225.pdf","startPage":"391","endPage":"397","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/16.275225","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6817","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Measurements of leakage currents and the capacitance of the storage capacitor in a single DRAM cell","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/275225/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1994","displayDocTitle":"Measurements of leakage currents and the capacitance of the storage capacitor in a single DRAM cell","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4684204","volume":"41","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 1994","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Measurements of leakage currents and the capacitance of the storage capacitor in a single DRAM cell","sourcePdf":"00275225.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047911S","chronDate":"Mar 1994","isNumber":"6817","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"5","articleId":"275225","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":275228,"authors":[{"name":"R.

The magnitude of this post-stress effect is strongly dependent on the conditions of the preceding stress, on the post-stress conditions and on the process parameters. For measurements at 293 K, a simple model is proposed which is based on the release of hydrogen by the thermal detrapping of holes, and which can explain the observed dependencies. The importance of the post-stress D/sub it/-generation is illustrated for the case of dynamic stress conditions where it can lead to an apparently deviating degradation behavior.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/16.275228","startPage":"413","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel1/16/6817/00275228.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/16.275228","endPage":"419","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6817","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the hot-carrier-induced post-stress interface trap generation in n-channel MOS transistors","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/275228/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1994","displayDocTitle":"On the hot-carrier-induced post-stress interface trap generation in n-channel MOS transistors","volume":"41","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4684207","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"March 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the hot-carrier-induced post-stress interface trap generation in n-channel MOS transistors","sourcePdf":"00275228.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043674S","chronDate":"Mar 1994","isNumber":"6817","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"39","articleId":"275228","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":275235,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The Godard algorithm and the generalized Sato algorithm are two widely referenced algorithms for blind equalization of a QAM system. These algorithms exhibit very slow convergence rates when compared to algorithms employed in conventional data-aided equalization schemes. In order to speed up the convergence process, these algorithms may be switched over to a decision-directed equalization scheme once the error level is reasonably low. The authors present a scheme which is capable of operating in two modes: blind equalization mode and a mode similar to the decision-directed equalization mode. In this proposed scheme, the dominant mode of operation changes from the blind equalization mode at higher error levels to the mode similar to the decision-directed equalization mode at lower error levels. Manual switch-over to the decision-directed mode from the blind equalization mode, or vice-versa, is not necessary since transitions between the two modes take place smoothly and automatically.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/26.275296","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/26/6819/00275296.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.275296","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6819","startPage":"22","endPage":"28","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dual-mode type algorithms for blind equalization","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=275296","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Dual-mode type algorithms for blind equalization","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/275296/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1994","isJournal":true,"volume":"42","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 1994","accessionNumber":"4679716","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dual-mode type algorithms for blind equalization","sourcePdf":"00275296.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038135S","chronDate":"Jan 1994","isNumber":"6819","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"53","articleId":"275296","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":275300,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The error-floors caused by the Doppler spread in a fast fading channel are removed in both flat and selective fading channels. However, the error-floors caused by the delay spread are lower-bounded by those that exist in the ideal coherent detection. The systems are modeled as frequency-selective fast Rayleigh fading channels, corrupted by co-channel interference (CCI) and additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN). In the proposed scheme, pilot symbols are inserted periodically to monitor the channel characteristics. The fading processes experienced by the pilot symbols are used to estimate those suffered by the data symbols using interpolation or filtering. The estimated fade characteristics are used to compensate the random phase variation caused by the Doppler spread, so that the signals can be demodulated coherently. The theoretical performances of the fade compensated coherent modems are evaluated. The results show that the fade compensated coherent demodulation with the least redundancy achieves the same performance as the ideal differential detection in a fading channel. The performance approaches that of the ideal coherent demodulation as more redundancy is allowed. The pilot-symbol-insertion (PSI) scheme is also applicable to M-ary QAM modems and Rician channels. The residual frequency offset can also be compensated by the PSI technique.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Pilot-symbol aided coherent M-ary PSK in frequency-selective fast Rayleigh fading channels","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","doi":"10.1109/26.275301","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/26/6819/00275301.pdf","startPage":"54","endPage":"62","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.275301","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6819","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=275301","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/275301/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1994","displayDocTitle":"Pilot-symbol aided coherent M-ary PSK in frequency-selective fast Rayleigh fading channels","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"42","issue":"1","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Jan. 1994","accessionNumber":"4679720","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Pilot-symbol aided coherent M-ary PSK in frequency-selective fast Rayleigh fading channels","sourcePdf":"00275301.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.048174S","chronDate":"Jan 1994","isNumber":"6819","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"21","articleId":"275301","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":275302,"authors":[{"name":"D.

Due to this correlation, the errors caused by fading tend to occur in bursts. In the analysis, no assumption simplifying the problem is made. For fast fading the authors consider the most general case where both phase and amplitude distortion resulting from the fading process could change significantly and thus cannot be assumed to be constant over a number of transmitted symbols. It is shown that the estimator's hardware structure consists of a combination of envelope, multiple differential and coherent detectors. With multiple differential detectors they define a receiver structure consisting of a combination of more than one distinct differential detectors each of them employing a progressively increasing (by the symbol duration) time-delay element. The outputs of these detectors are jointly processed by means of an algorithm which is presented in a recursive form. The derivation of this new receiver is general enough to accommodate trellis coded phase shift keying (PSK) and quadrature amplitude modulated (QAM) systems. Differentially encoded signals, such as the /spl pi//4-shift differential quadrature phase shift keying (DQPSK) scheme can also be incorporated. In order to reduce the overall receiver implementation complexity, several reduced complexity, near-optimal versions of the algorithm are presented. These reduced complexity receivers are based on the use of only a few multiple differential detectors. Performance evaluation results for reduced complexity trellis coded /spl pi//4-shift DQPSK, /spl pi//4-shift 8-DQAM (differential quadrature amplitude modulation) and 8-DPSK (differential phase shift keying) systems have demonstrated that the proposed receivers significantly reduce the error floors caused by fading.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal decoding of coded PSK and QAM signals in correlated fast fading channels and AWGN: a combined envelope, multiple differential and coherent detection approach","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","doi":"10.1109/26.275302","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/26/6819/00275302.pdf","startPage":"63","endPage":"75","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.275302","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6819","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=275302","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/275302/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1994","displayDocTitle":"Optimal decoding of coded PSK and QAM signals in correlated fast fading channels and AWGN: a combined envelope, multiple differential and coherent detection approach","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"42","issue":"1","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Jan. 1994","accessionNumber":"4679721","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal decoding of coded PSK and QAM signals in correlated fast fading channels and AWGN: a combined envelope, multiple differential and coherent detection approach","sourcePdf":"00275302.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.166394S","chronDate":"Jan 1994","isNumber":"6819","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"85","articleId":"275302","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":275303,"authors":[{"name":"D.

Receiver structures based on these metrics are proposed and their error probability performance analyzed and/or simulated. The results represent a generalization of the notion of multiple symbol differential detection, previously introduced by the authors for MPSK over an AWGN, to the fading channel and other modulations. For the coded cases, ideal interleaving/deinterleaving is assumed and furthermore the presence or absence of channel state information. An interesting side result is that for a constant envelope modulation transmitted over a fading channel with unknown but rapidly-varying phase error (the other extreme to the slowly-varying phase error case normally assumed for differential detection), under certain practical assumptions, it is shown that the optimum receiver is of the limiter-discriminator type.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/275303/","volume":"42","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"4679730","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Maximum-likelihood differential detection of uncoded and trellis coded amplitude phase modulation over AWGN and fading channels/spl minus/metrics and performance","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Maximum-likelihood differential detection of uncoded and trellis coded amplitude phase modulation over AWGN and fading channels/spl minus/metrics and performance","sourcePdf":"275303.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.04546S","chronDate":"Jan.  1994","isNumber":"6819","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"149","articleId":"275303","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":275311,"authors":[{"name":"J.E.

The authors consider a form of the problem of routing for the minimization of congestion as a step toward the study of the joint routing-scheduling problem. They formulate this as a combinatorial-optimization problem, and they use Hopfield neural networks (NN) for its solution. The determination of the coefficients in the connection weights is the most critical issue in the design and simulation of Hopfield NN models. They use the method of Lagrange multipliers, which permits these coefficients to vary dynamically along with the evolution of the system state. Extensive software simulation results demonstrate the capability of their approach to determine good sets of routes in large heavily congested networks.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/26.275311","startPage":"166","endPage":"177","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.275311","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6819","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/26/6819/00275311.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A neural network approach to routing without interference in multihop radio networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/275311/","displayDocTitle":"A neural network approach to routing without interference in multihop radio networks","volume":"42","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4679729","publicationDate":"Jan. 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1994","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A neural network approach to routing without interference in multihop radio networks","sourcePdf":"00275311.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.057888S","chronDate":"Jan 1994","isNumber":"6819","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"29","articleId":"275311","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":275333,"authors":[{"name":"J.

This puts more control into users' hands. Inverse multiplexers provide the ability to dial up multimegabit-per-second digital connections without requiring significant changes to the network itself.

We demonstrate this new technique on a synchronous pipelined design with approximately 5/spl times/10/sup 120/ states. Our model checking algorithm handles full CTL with fairness constraints. Consequently, we are able to express a number of important liveness and fairness properties, which would otherwise not be expressible in CTL.

The authors found that exactly the same crosstalk/signal ratio can be tolerated in a CMC-system with and without EDFA.

Characterization of a 6200 km optically amplified link indicates that the relative contribution of PMD to these fluctuations is not significant when PMD is limited to 0.1 ps//spl radic/km.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Polarization mode dispersion","Stimulated emission","Optical fiber polarization","Fluctuations","Optical filters","Optical attenuators","Bit error rate","Optical receivers","Erbium-doped fiber amplifier","Optical saturation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optical links","submarine cables","optical cables","optical dispersion","optical fibres","light polarisation","fluctuations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["system penalties","polarization mode dispersion","optically amplified transoceanic link","differential group delays","numerical simulations","analytic formulas","probability density functions","cumulated probabilities","fluctuations","bit-error-rate","6200 km","5 Gbit/s"]}],"doi":"10.1109/68.275513","publicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Technology Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Technology Letters","pdfPath":"/iel3/68/6825/00275513.pdf","startPage":"443","endPage":"445","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6825","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/68.275513","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Assessment of system penalties induced by polarization mode dispersion in a 5 Gb/s optically amplified transoceanic link","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=275513","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Assessment of system penalties induced by polarization mode dispersion in a 5 Gb/s optically amplified transoceanic link","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/275513/","volume":"6","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 1994","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4680361","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1994","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Assessment of system penalties induced by polarization mode dispersion in a 5 Gb/s optically amplified transoceanic link","sourcePdf":"00275513.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.028907S","chronDate":"March  1994","isNumber":"6825","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"68","citationCount":"22","articleId":"275513","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Letter","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":275517,"authors":[{"name":"D.J.

The integral equation for a hemispherical dielectric-resonator antenna (DRA), excited by either a coaxial probe or a slot aperture, is obtained. The integral equation is solved using the method of moments. The antenna characteristics, such as input impedance, radiation patterns, directivity, and efficiency, are computed numerically, around the resonant frequency of the TE/sub 111/ mode (the HEM/sub 11/ mode for cylindrical coordinates).

This technique uses what they term modified rank sequences, which is a modification of the construction implicit in the matrix decomposition method of Di (1981). They prove that if a particular rank sequence stabilizes (the last two terms of the sequence are equal) to a value strictly less then the common row size of the defining block matrices, then this value equals the number of signals, provided that the number of signals has not exceeded a Bresler-Macovski (1986) type bound. Using the above characterization of stability, they formulate an algorithm that either determines the number of signals or indicates that the resolution capability of the algorithm has been exceeded. They also provide theorems that show that under certain conditions, a rank sequence can stabilize to a value strictly less than the number of signals.

Two types of source transmissions are considered: (1) single signal transmission (SST), and (2) dual signal transmission (DST). The model is given in terms of several parameters, including the wave direction of arrival (DOA) and state of polarization. A compact expression is derived for the Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) on the estimation errors of these parameters for the multi-source multi-vector-sensor model. Quality measures including mean-square angular error (MSAE) and covariance of vector angular error (CVAE) are introduced, and their lower bounds are derived. The advantage of using vector sensors is highlighted by explicit evaluation of the MSAE and CVAE bounds for source localization with a single vector sensor. A simple algorithm for estimating the source DOA with this sensor is presented along with its statistical performance analysis.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Vector-sensor array processing for electromagnetic source localization","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/78.275610","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/78/6829/00275610.pdf","startPage":"376","endPage":"398","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.275610","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6829","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=275610","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/275610/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1994","displayDocTitle":"Vector-sensor array processing for electromagnetic source localization","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"42","issue":"2","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Feb. 1994","accessionNumber":"4672617","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Vector-sensor array processing for electromagnetic source localization","sourcePdf":"00275610.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.080667S","chronDate":"Feb 1994","isNumber":"6829","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"447","articleId":"275610","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":275625,"authors":[{"name":"J.L.

The Type I beamformer is representative of block processing methods where the same input data is used both to compute the adaptive weights and to form the beamformer output. The Type II beamformer, as in many recursive schemes, applies adaptive weights computed from previous data to the current input. Due to correlation between the adaptive weights and the input data, the Type I LCMV beamformer exhibits signal cancellation, which is shown here to cause signal estimate bias. To explicitly account for signal cancellation, the mean-square error (MSE) and output signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) measures of the bias-corrected Type I beamformer are analyzed, thus extending previous results. Further, new analytical results for these performance measures are given for the Type II LCMV beamformer. Comparison of bias-corrected Type I and Type II implementations indicate that both methods yield exactly the same MSE and output SNR performance.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/275625/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1994","volume":"42","issue":"2","accessionNumber":"4672631","publicationDate":"Feb. 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"On the mean-square error performance of adaptive minimum variance beamformers based on the sample covariance matrix","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the mean-square error performance of adaptive minimum variance beamformers based on the sample covariance matrix","sourcePdf":"00275625.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.030545S","chronDate":"Feb 1994","isNumber":"6829","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"10","articleId":"275625","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":275626,"authors":[{"name":"R.

Assuming that the desired phase response is prescribed at a discrete set of frequency points, we formulate a general least-squares equation-error solution with a possible weight function. Based on the general formulation and detailed analysis of the introduced error, we construct a new algorithm for phase approximation. In addition to iterative weighting of the equation error, the nominal value of the desired group delay is also adjusted iteratively to minimize the total phase error measure in equalizer applications. This new feature essentially eliminates the difficult choice of the nominal group delay which is known to have a profound effect on the stability of the designed allpass filter. The proposed method can be used for highpass and bandpass equalization as well, where the total phase error can be further reduced by introducing an adjustable-phase offset in the optimization. The performance of the algorithm is analyzed in detail with examples. First we examine the approximation of a given phase function. Then we study the equalization of the nonlinear phase of various lowpass filters. Also, a bandpass example is included. Finally we demonstrate the use of the algorithm for the design of approximately linear-phase recursive filters as a parallel connection of a delay line and an allpass filter.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6830","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/82.275662","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Analog and Digital Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Analog and Digital Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/82/6830/00275662.pdf","startPage":"40","endPage":"48","doi":"10.1109/82.275662","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Simple and robust method for the design of allpass filters using least-squares phase error criterion","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1994","displayDocTitle":"Simple and robust method for the design of allpass filters using least-squares phase error criterion","volume":"41","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 1994","accessionNumber":"4646667","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/275662/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Simple and robust method for the design of allpass filters using least-squares phase error criterion","sourcePdf":"00275662.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044596S","chronDate":"Jan 1994","isNumber":"6830","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"82","citationCount":"71","articleId":"275662","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":275664,"authors":[{"name":"R.D.

In this approach, the stability of the modulator is achieved by preventing any unbounded increase in the internal node-voltages through the insertion of local feedback signals inside the modulator loop. In the past, absolute bounds for stability have been derived for the first-order converter. This property is exploited in stabilizing a higher order loop by activating local first-order loops as soon as the internal integrators overload. With local feedback, individual integrators are prevented from saturating and the output voltages are within the proper bounds. The error caused by the local feedback signals is cancelled by feeding these signals through alternate signal paths, in a way similar to the quantization noise cancellation mechanism in a MASH architecture. Since the frequency of overloading can be made very low by proper design, the effect of imperfect cancellation due to mismatches in the two signal paths caused by the modulator nonidealities is quite small. Hence, compared to the inherently stable MASH architectures, the proposed approach achieves stability and is yet much less sensitive to component mismatches. In a sampled data environment where the integrator is realized using op amps, this translates into a low op amp gain requirement. Simulation results confirm that third order modulators using op amps with gain as low as 50 achieve a peak signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of about 83 dB with an oversampling ratio of 64. This is less than 1 dB from the SNR achieved with infinite op amp gain.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/82.275665","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/82.275665","startPage":"19","endPage":"25","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Analog and Digital Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/82/6830/00275665.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Analog and Digital Signal Processing","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6830","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High-order single-stage single-bit oversampling A/D converter stabilized with local feedback loops","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1994","displayDocTitle":"High-order single-stage single-bit oversampling A/D converter stabilized with local feedback loops","publicationDate":"Jan. 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","volume":"41","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4646664","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/275665/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High-order single-stage single-bit oversampling A/D converter stabilized with local feedback loops","sourcePdf":"00275665.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.056145S","chronDate":"Jan 1994","isNumber":"6830","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"82","citationCount":"34","articleId":"275665","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":275666,"authors":[{"name":"Seung-Hoon Lee","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Sogang University, Seoul, South Korea"],"lastName":"Seung-Hoon Lee","id":"37281136400"},{"name":"Bang-Sup Song","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering and the Coordinated Science Laboratory, University of Illinois, Urbana, IL, USA"],"lastName":"Bang-Sup Song","id":"37274662800"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1057-7130"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-125X"}],"articleNumber":"275666","dbTime":"40 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":19,"citationCountPatent":4,"totalDownloads":364},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Calibration","Error correction","Error correction codes","Circuits","Analog-digital conversion","Gain measurement","Size measurement","Hardware","Digital-analog conversion","Computer errors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analogue-digital conversion","calibration","coding errors","circuit analysis computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital-domain multi-step ADC calibration","interstage gain proration technique","digital calibration","analog-to-digital converters","switching function","range mismatch problem","interstage gain errors","nonlinearity correction","capacitor-array multiplying ADC","code-error measurements","simulation","digital code error calibration"]}],"abstract":"The interstage gain proration technique greatly simplifies the task of digitally calibrating multi-step analog-to-digital converters (ADC's) by reducing the number of error measurements and the memory size to store code errors. This technique also makes it feasible to move the calibration hardware into the digital domain, leaving only the switching function in the analog domain. Even though calibrating a multi-step ADC stage-by-stage gives rise to a range mismatch problem between stages, by digitally subtracting prorated interstage gain errors from the latter-stage code errors, the proposed technique corrects nonlinearities resulting from these inaccurate interstage gains. Simulated ADC examples based on a capacitor-array (C-array) multiplying digital-to-analog converter (MDAC) demonstrate a substantial saving in the number of code-error measurements. For example, when calibrating two stages of n/sub 1/ and n/sub 2/ bits each, the resulting number of code-error measurements is given in comparison to the straightforward single-stage calibration.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/82.275666","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Analog and Digital Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Analog and Digital Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/82/6830/00275666.pdf","startPage":"12","endPage":"18","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/82.275666","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6830","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Interstage gain proration technique for digital-domain multi-step ADC calibration","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=275666","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/275666/","displayDocTitle":"Interstage gain proration technique for digital-domain multi-step ADC calibration","volume":"41","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 1994","accessionNumber":"4646663","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Interstage gain proration technique for digital-domain multi-step ADC calibration","sourcePdf":"00275666.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.079012S","chronDate":"Jan 1994","isNumber":"6830","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"82","citationCount":"19","articleId":"275666","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":275675,"authors":[{"name":"G.A.

Disk arrays increase secondary storage throughput by spreading data over many disks so that large accesses are striped for parallel operation and so that many small accesses can operate concurrently. Fast networks preserve throughput improvements derived from disk arrays on file server as data is delivered to increasingly distant client systems. Secondary storage latency is primarily addressed by large client and server file caches. Whenever data to be read is found in the cache or data to be written can be delayed in the cache, latency is as short as if secondary storage were constructed with semiconductor memory.

GALAPAGOS is general-purpose because graphic objects are laid out not by specifying how to lay them out, but just by specifying the preferences for the layout. GALAPAGOS can not only lay out complicated graphs automatically, but also allow users to modify the constraints at run time so that users can tell the system their own preferences.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/WVL.1992.275781","startPage":"74","endPage":"80","publicationTitle":"Proceedings IEEE Workshop on Visual Languages","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WVL.1992.275781","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6833","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings IEEE Workshop on Visual Languages","pdfPath":"/iel2/895/6833/00275781.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Graphic object layout with interactive genetic algorithms","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/275781/","displayDocTitle":"Graphic object layout with interactive genetic algorithms","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"4488398","publicationDate":"1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"15-18 Sept. 1992","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-18 Sep 1992","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Graphic object layout with interactive genetic algorithms","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"00275781.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.081072S","chronDate":"15-18 Sep 1992","isNumber":"6833","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"895","citationCount":"24","articleId":"275781","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":275853,"authors":[{"name":"N.T.

The split spectrum processing (SSP) technique using nonlinear algorithms is very effective in grain noise suppression and flaw detection. The wavelet transform technique is used to perform spectral decomposition, followed by the application of various nonlinear algorithms to obtain the output signal. The wavelet transform is based on the principle of constant Q or constant relative bandwidth frequency. Experimental results for the constant-Q SSP technique are presented. The experimental data indicate improved performance in identifying and extracting multiple targets compared to the conventional fixed bandwidth SSP.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ULTSYM.1992.275883","publicationTitle":"IEEE 1992 Ultrasonics Symposium Proceedings","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE 1992 Ultrasonics Symposium Proceedings","pdfPath":"/iel2/1020/6834/00275883.pdf","startPage":"1211","endPage":"1215 vol.2","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ULTSYM.1992.275883","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6834","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Detection of ultrasonic flaw signals using wavelet transform techniques","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=275883","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 Oct 1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/275883/","displayDocTitle":"Detection of ultrasonic flaw signals using wavelet transform techniques","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1992","accessionNumber":"4558662","conferenceDate":"20-23 Oct. 1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Detection of ultrasonic flaw signals using wavelet transform techniques","confLoc":"Tucson, AZ, USA","sourcePdf":"00275883.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.028863S","chronDate":"20-23 Oct 1992","isNumber":"6834","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1020","citationCount":"2","articleId":"275883","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":275885,"authors":[{"name":"R.M.

It is shown that it can be achieved using adaptive convolution techniques instead of delay line techniques.

The use of two slightly inclined reflectors results in a Z-shaped filter which conserves the temperature stability of quartz substrate.

The fractional bandwidth is 0.14%, sidelobes are suppressed more than 40 dB, the group delay ripple is smaller than 0.5 mu s, and the insertion loss is 4.5 dB.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 Oct 1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/276054/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"4552867","publicationDate":"1992","conferenceDate":"20-23 Oct. 1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"New resonator filter with high sidelobe suppression","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"New resonator filter with high sidelobe suppression","confLoc":"Tucson, AZ, USA","sourcePdf":"00276054.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063875S","chronDate":"20-23 Oct 1992","isNumber":"6834","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1020","citationCount":"13","articleId":"276054","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":276055,"authors":[{"name":"O.

In-phase and quadrature taps can be implemented for both the transduction and reflection functions. Asymmetric frequency responses can be implemented or matching distortion effects compensated without chirping the transducer.

Assuming uniform mixing of contrast medium and background subtraction, the cross-section of each vessel is reconstructed through a binary representation. A priori information about both the slice to be reconstructed and the relationships between adjacent slices are incorporated to lessen ambiguities on the reconstruction. Taking into account the knowledge of normal vessel geometry, an initial solution of each slice is created using an elliptic model-based method. This initial solution is then deformed to be made consistent with projection data while being constrained into a connected realistic shape. For that purpose, properties on the expected optimal solution are described through a Markov random field. To find an optimal solution, a specific optimization algorithm based on simulated annealing is used. The method performs well both on single vessels and on branching vessels possessing an additional inherent ambiguity when viewed at oblique angles. Results on 2D slice independent reconstruction and 3D reconstruction of a stack of spatially continuous 2D slices are presented for single vessels and bifurcations.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/42.276144","startPage":"48","endPage":"60","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","pdfPath":"/iel1/42/6838/00276144.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/42.276144","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6838","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 3D reconstruction of vascular structures from two X-ray angiograms using an adapted simulated annealing algorithm","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image reconstruction","Shape","Lesions","Bifurcation","Simulated annealing","Angiography","Geometry","Solid modeling","Markov random fields","Image processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["simulated annealing","diagnostic radiography","image reconstruction","medical image processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3D reconstruction","vascular structures","X-ray angiography","adapted simulated annealing algorithm","normal vessel geometry","projection data","Markov Random Field","optimization algorithm","branching vessels","oblique angles","2D slice independent reconstruction","spatially continuous 2D slices","bifurcations","medical diagnostic imaging"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/276144/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1994","displayDocTitle":"A 3D reconstruction of vascular structures from two X-ray angiograms using an adapted simulated annealing algorithm","volume":"13","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4674167","pubMedId":"18218483","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 3D reconstruction of vascular structures from two X-ray angiograms using an adapted simulated annealing algorithm","sourcePdf":"00276144.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041272S","chronDate":"March  1994","isNumber":"6838","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"42","citationCount":"60","articleId":"276144","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":276145,"authors":[{"name":"T.V.

A method for accomplishing the maximization step using one step of Newton's method is proposed. The algorithm is regularized with the method of sieves. Evaluations using both Monte Carlo simulations and phantom studies on the Siemens 953B scanner suggest that the algorithm yields unbiased images with significantly lower variances than filtered-backprojection when the images are reconstructed to the intrinsic resolution. Large features in the images converge in under 200 iterations while the smallest features required up to 2,000 iterations. All but the smallest features in typical transmission scans converge in approximately 250 iterations.

Grangeat (1987), involving the derivative of the three-dimensional (3D) Radon transform, but unlike Grangeat's algorithm, no 3D rebinning step is required. Data redundancy, which occurs when several cone-beam projections supply the same values in the Radon domain, is handled using an elegant weighting function and without discarding data. The algorithm is expressed in a convenient cone-beam detector reference frame, and a specific example for the case of a dual orthogonal circular orbit is presented. When the method is applied to a single circular orbit (even though Tuy's condition is not satisfied), it is shown to be equivalent to the well-known algorithm of L.A. Feldkamp et al.

Because the conventional blockmatching motion compensation method (BMA) can only cope with the problem of translational movement of the scene, some researchers have proposed deformable-block-based motion compensation such as control grid interpolation (CGI) and the triangle-based method (TBM). CGI begins with a spatial displacement for a small number of points in an image, termed control points. TBM partitions the image frame into triangular patches with equal size that are deformable during the motion compensation. These methods do not consider using the different motion characteristics and the shape properties of the moving objects, but instead apply the same motion estimation algorithm to every part of the scene which may be stationary or moving. The present authors propose a new motion compensation method called hierarchical grid interpolation (HGI) which segments a frame into various quadrangles with different sizes (described by quadtree segmentation) according to the motion activity. In the experiments, the authors compare HGI with the conventional BMA and TBM. HGI requires less computation, produces less prediction error, and requires lower transmission bit-rate. It also achieves a subjective image quality that is better than the conventional motion compensation coder.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/76.276171","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","pdfPath":"/iel4/76/6839/00276171.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/76.276171","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6839","startPage":"42","endPage":"52","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new motion compensation method for image sequence coding using hierarchical grid interpolation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=276171","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A new motion compensation method for image sequence coding using hierarchical grid interpolation","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/276171/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1994","isJournal":true,"volume":"4","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Feb. 1994","accessionNumber":"4699540","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new motion compensation method for image sequence coding using hierarchical grid interpolation","sourcePdf":"00276171.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.04651S","chronDate":"Feb 1994","isNumber":"6839","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"93","articleId":"276171","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":276175,"authors":[{"name":"Her-Ming Jong","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Her-Ming Jong","id":"37354884000"},{"name":"Liang-Gee Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Liang-Gee Chen","id":"37280381000"},{"name":"Tzi-Dar Chiueh","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Tzi-Dar Chiueh","id":"37273337000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1051-8215"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2205"}],"articleNumber":"276175","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":56,"citationCountPatent":11,"totalDownloads":137},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Costs","Video coding","Bandwidth","Motion estimation","Computational efficiency","Video sequences","Sun","Spatial resolution","Hardware","Sampling methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image coding","video signals","search problems","block codes","image sequences","motion estimation","parameter estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cost reduction","3-step search block matching algorithm","video coding","accuracy improvement","multiple-candidate search","estimation accuracy","overlapping strategy","large-area search","motion estimators","on-chip buffers","input bandwidth requirements"]}],"abstract":"Proposes three modifications on the 3-step hierarchical search for video coding: the multiple-candidate search that improves the estimation accuracy, a method of subsampling that reduces computation and input data amount, and an overlapping strategy to improve the accuracy of a large-area search.

It is demonstrated that the fewest routing switches are required when each logical pin appears on only one side of the logic cell rather than two or more.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","publicationTitle":"Proceedings 1992 IEEE International Conference on Computer Design: VLSI in Computers & Processors","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings 1992 IEEE International Conference on Computer Design: VLSI in Computers & Processors","pdfPath":"/iel2/442/6840/00276198.pdf","startPage":"99","endPage":"104","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improving FPGA routing architectures using architecture and CAD interactions","doi":"10.1109/ICCD.1992.276198","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6840","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCD.1992.276198","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=276198","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/276198/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Oct 1992","displayDocTitle":"Improving FPGA routing architectures using architecture and CAD interactions","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1992","accessionNumber":"4483012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"11-14 Oct. 1992","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improving FPGA routing architectures using architecture and CAD interactions","confLoc":"Cambridge, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"00276198.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.029984S","chronDate":"11-14 Oct 1992","isNumber":"6840","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"442","citationCount":"11","articleId":"276198","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":276199,"authors":[{"name":"N.B.

However, methods that use a purely logical partitioning give designs that are difficult to route, and methods that use a purely physical partitioning do not result in legal logical blocks.

The algorithm carries out technology mapping and delay optimization on the entire Boolean network, instead of decomposing it into fanout-free trees and mapping each tree separately as in most previous algorithms. As a preprocessing step, a general algorithm that transforms an arbitrary n-input network into a two-input network with only O(1) factor increase in the network depth is introduced. Also presented is a graph-matching-based technique used as a postprocessing step which optimizes the area without increasing the delay. The DAG-Map algorithm was tested on the MCNC logic synthesis benchmarks. Compared with previous algorithms, it reduces both the network depth and the number of lookup-tables.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Delay","Tree graphs","Logic testing","Vegetation mapping","Network synthesis","Boolean functions","Logic arrays","Logic gates","Design optimization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["delays","logic arrays","logic design","logic testing","optimisation","table lookup"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["graph-based FPGA technology mapping algorithm","delay optimization","DAG-Map","lookup-table-based field programmable gate array","Boolean network","fanout-free trees","preprocessing step","arbitrary n-input network","graph-matching-based technique","MCNC logic synthesis benchmarks"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=276239","doi":"10.1109/ICCD.1992.276239","startPage":"154","endPage":"158","publicationTitle":"Proceedings 1992 IEEE International Conference on Computer Design: VLSI in Computers & Processors","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings 1992 IEEE International Conference on Computer Design: VLSI in Computers & Processors","pdfPath":"/iel2/442/6840/00276239.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6840","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCD.1992.276239","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/276239/","displayDocTitle":"An improved graph-based FPGA technology mapping algorithm for delay optimization","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Oct 1992","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4488163","conferenceDate":"11-14 Oct. 1992","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An improved graph-based FPGA technology mapping algorithm for delay optimization","confLoc":"Cambridge, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"00276239.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065272S","chronDate":"11-14 Oct 1992","isNumber":"6840","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"442","citationCount":"11","articleId":"276239","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":276240,"authors":[{"name":"S.-C.

Their Boolean decomposition scheme works directly on a reduced ordered binary decision diagram (ROBDD) of a subject function, using two techniques. The first, referred to as cutting, is an efficient implementation of Roth-Karp decomposition. The second technique is referred to as a substitution. The idea is to replace subgraphs of ROBDD by new variables. The substitution process is accompanied by certain reductions of the resulting ROBDD graph, which further decreases its size.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings 1992 IEEE International Conference on Computer Design: VLSI in Computers & Processors","pdfPath":"/iel2/442/6840/00276240.pdf","startPage":"159","endPage":"162","publicationTitle":"Proceedings 1992 IEEE International Conference on Computer Design: VLSI in Computers & Processors","doi":"10.1109/ICCD.1992.276240","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCD.1992.276240","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6840","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=276240","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Technology mapping via transformations of function graphs","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Boolean functions","Data structures","Electronics packaging","Programmable logic arrays","Computer architecture","Design engineering","Prototypes","Wires","Integrated circuit interconnections","Combinational circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Boolean functions","combinatorial circuits","logic design","table lookup"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["technology mapping","transformations of function graphs","combinational circuit","Boolean equations","minimum number of blocks","target TLU table lookup architecture","reduced ordered binary decision diagram","subject function","Roth-Karp decomposition"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/276240/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Oct. 1992","displayDocTitle":"Technology mapping via transformations of function graphs","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1992","accessionNumber":"4488164","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"11-14 Oct. 1992","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Technology mapping via transformations of function graphs","confLoc":"Cambridge, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"00276240.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.027165S","chronDate":"11-14 Oct. 1992","isNumber":"6840","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"442","citationCount":"20","articleId":"276240","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":276241,"authors":[{"name":"T.

Suggested cost functions optimize either the total padded delay, an estimate of the increase in area, or the maximum cycle time of the complete system.

These algorithms can be implemented in communication schemes where typically two-to-four level signaling is used and the channel exhibits very rapid changes in its characteristics. Both algorithms converge to the channel estimate within 100 data symbols for binary pulse-amplitude modulation (PAM) with SNR down to 10 dB. One employs blind trellis search; maximum-likelihood sequence estimation is done without the channel impulse response being known initially, but the estimate is gradually updated during the blind trellis search. The other is based on maximization, of the average likelihood function. The solution is obtained by an iterative technique based on the Baum-Welch algorithm. The performance of these algorithms is evaluated for 2-PAM signaling over three typical channel types with various noise levels.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.1992.276390","publicationTitle":"[Conference Record] GLOBECOM '92 - Communications for Global Users: IEEE","displayPublicationTitle":"[Conference Record] GLOBECOM '92 - Communications for Global Users: IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel2/645/6841/00276390.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GLOCOM.1992.276390","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6841","startPage":"910","endPage":"914 vol.2","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint data detection and channel estimation for rapidly fading channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=276390","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Joint data detection and channel estimation for rapidly fading channels","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-9 Dec 1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/276390/","conferenceDate":"6-9 Dec. 1992","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1992","accessionNumber":"4468080","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint data detection and channel estimation for rapidly fading channels","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"00276390.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.032917S","chronDate":"6-9 Dec 1992","isNumber":"6841","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"645","citationCount":"27","articleId":"276390","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":276391,"authors":[{"name":"S.A.

A combination of discrete-event link simulation and analysis of the obtained SIR statistics is used to explore the behavior of a CDMA system using SIR-based power control and to obtain performance estimates for such a system under various operating assumptions.

The quality criterion used in this study is the carrier-to-interference ratio (C/I) at the receiver.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"[Conference Record] GLOBECOM '92 - Communications for Global Users: IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel2/645/6841/00276399.pdf","startPage":"863","endPage":"867 vol.2","publicationTitle":"[Conference Record] GLOBECOM '92 - Communications for Global Users: IEEE","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.1992.276399","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GLOCOM.1992.276399","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6841","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=276399","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Power control based admission policies in cellular radio networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power control","Intelligent networks","Land mobile radio cellular systems","Interference","Base stations","Attenuation","Time division multiple access","Multiaccess communication","Mobile communication","Access control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","power control","radio networks","radiofrequency interference","telecommunications control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power control","admission policies","cellular radio networks","cochannel interference","transmitter-receiver pairs","network parameters","transmission powers","base stations","adaptive control","carrier-to-interference ratio"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/276399/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-9 Dec 1992","displayDocTitle":"Power control based admission policies in cellular radio networks","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1992","accessionNumber":"4468071","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"6-9 Dec. 1992","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power control based admission policies in cellular radio networks","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"00276399.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.132155S","chronDate":"6-9 Dec 1992","isNumber":"6841","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"645","citationCount":"40","articleId":"276399","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":276400,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The symbol error rate of the system is calculated as a function of the signal-to-noise and signal-to-interference ratios.

The capacity achievable by the terrestrial single-frequency gap-filler network utilizing the same satellite frequency and user receiver is also discussed. Numerical results show that remarkable capacity can be achieved utilizing high-Earth-orbit satellites complemented by terrestrial gap-filler transmission.

With such a propagation prediction tool, personal communications systems (PCSs) could be designed and installed more rapidly and economically than if measurements were required for each building.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.1992.276436","publicationTitle":"[Conference Record] GLOBECOM '92 - Communications for Global Users: IEEE","displayPublicationTitle":"[Conference Record] GLOBECOM '92 - Communications for Global Users: IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel2/645/6841/00276436.pdf","startPage":"649","endPage":"653 vol.2","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GLOCOM.1992.276436","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6841","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A ray tracing technique to predict path loss and delay spread inside buildings","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=276436","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-9 Dec 1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/276436/","displayDocTitle":"A ray tracing technique to predict path loss and delay spread inside buildings","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1992","accessionNumber":"4468034","conferenceDate":"6-9 Dec. 1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A ray tracing technique to predict path loss and delay spread inside buildings","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"00276436.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050713S","chronDate":"6-9 Dec 1992","isNumber":"6841","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"645","citationCount":"75","articleId":"276436","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":276462,"authors":[{"name":"P.

The improvement achieved can amount to several decibels, and is excellent at high signal-to-noise ratios. The average overhead, required in the subsequent processing stages is evaluated and shown to be small at signal-to-noise ratios of interest.

For all sequences examined, increasing the delay in the video system decreases the necessary peak rate and significantly increases the number of calls that can be carried by the network. As an operational traffic descriptor for video, the leaky-bucket algorithm appears to be superior to the sliding-window algorithm. With a delay in the video system, the statistical multiplexing gain from variable bit rate (VBR) over constant bit rate (CBR) video is upper bounded by roughly a factor of three, and obtaining a gain of 1.5 to 2.0 can require the operational traffic descriptor to have a window or bucket size on the order of a thousand cells.

The algorithm is optimum in the sense of minimizing the mobile transmitted power and hence reduces the level of interference. Normally, the open-loop power control is used to mitigate long-term variations. The mobile unit measures the total received power and uses the measurement to estimate the transmission loss. This estimate is used to permit a rapid response to changes in the channel characteristics. It is shown that the open-loop mobile transmitted power is inversely proportional to its total received power. The constant can be part of a broadcast message that it is sent by the home cell. It is shown that the constant is sensitive to system parameters such as the cell effective radiated power (EPR), noise figure, antenna gain, the set of E/sub b//N/sub t/, and system loading. The open loop should have a large dynamic range (80 dB) and a reasonable fast response in order to accommodate subscriber units passing behind buildings or subject to shadowing effects.

The system is constrained to have an equipartition of energy over the entire transmission band used at the input to the channel. This yields suboptimal performance relative to the system based on a water-pouring transmit energy distribution. Although the performance degradation is typically negligible, the proposed bandwidth optimization procedures offer a significant computational advantage. It is shown that the procedures apply equally well to multicarrier and single-carrier modulation/equalization techniques.

Adjustment of the timing phase of the input analog-to-digital (A/D) converter is not allowed, and thus timing recovery is based completely on received samples and is asynchronous with the A/D converter. To improve timing resolution over that provided by oversampling and decimation alone, the concept of filter coefficient interpolation is evaluated for a steam transmission, coherent, Nyquist-filtered, binary-PSK (BPSK) modem. This is a low-complexity, table lookup method that is useful in low-consumed-power radio modems. Performance is presented for E/sub b//N/sub 0/ down to 0 dB, and loop filtering is used to extend the threshold E/sub b//N/sub 0/ for successful receiver operation. The timing loop is shown analytically to converge in the mean-square sense. The training mode of the coherent modem, is discussed.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6841","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GLOCOM.1992.276548","publicationTitle":"[Conference Record] GLOBECOM '92 - Communications for Global Users: IEEE","displayPublicationTitle":"[Conference Record] GLOBECOM '92 - Communications for Global Users: IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel2/645/6841/00276548.pdf","startPage":"472","endPage":"478 vol.1","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.1992.276548","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Filter coefficient interpolated timing recovery in sampled coherent PSK receivers","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-9 Dec 1992","displayDocTitle":"Filter coefficient interpolated timing recovery in sampled coherent PSK receivers","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"6-9 Dec. 1992","publicationDate":"1992","accessionNumber":"4474441","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/276548/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Filter coefficient interpolated timing recovery in sampled coherent PSK receivers","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"00276548.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.032672S","chronDate":"6-9 Dec 1992","isNumber":"6841","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"645","citationCount":"3","articleId":"276548","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":276550,"authors":[{"name":"H.

A high compression ratio is achieved which reduces the channel transmission bandwidth and improves the utilities of the communication system.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.1992.276605","pdfPath":"/iel2/645/6841/00276605.pdf","startPage":"1315","endPage":"1318 vol.3","displayPublicationTitle":"[Conference Record] GLOBECOM '92 - Communications for Global Users: IEEE","publicationTitle":"[Conference Record] GLOBECOM '92 - Communications for Global Users: IEEE","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GLOCOM.1992.276605","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6841","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Image transmission based on neural network approaches","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/276605/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-9 Dec 1992","displayDocTitle":"Image transmission based on neural network approaches","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4482813","publicationDate":"1992","conferenceDate":"6-9 Dec. 1992","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Image transmission based on neural network approaches","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"00276605.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055602S","chronDate":"6-9 Dec 1992","isNumber":"6841","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"645","articleId":"276605","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":276608,"authors":[{"name":"S.S.H.

This scheme, called the address decomposition, is based on decomposing the addressing into a hierarchy of addressing steps, each of a low dimensionality. As the memory size associated with a direct addressing scheme has an exponential growth with the dimensionality, this decomposition of addressing results in a substantial decrease in the complexity. In this case, by using a memory of a practical size, one can move along a tradeoff curve which is nearly optimum. For example, in a space of dimensionality N=32, a block of memory of 2.5 kbytes per N dimensions is used to achieve a shape gain of 0.92 dB with a constellation expansion ratio of 1.25 and a peak to average power ratio of 2.95.

Here, a sequence of subsets of the signal set is coded using block and/or convolutional codes. For complexity reasons the decoding is done in several stages (multistage decoding). Punctured convolutional codes and parity check codes are applied to this scheme in channel with additive white Gaussian noise. The usual decoder structure does not exploit the asymptotic gain of a code combination at a bit error rate of 10/sup -5/. The decoder structure is expanded by three means: interleaving between the coded bits of every level, use of reliability information about decoding, and iterative decoding. It is shown that such a scheme can gain about 1 dB in signal-to-noise ratio compared to trellis coded modulation with a small increase of complexity. The price to be paid is additional decoder delay.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"[Conference Record] GLOBECOM '92 - Communications for Global Users: IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel2/645/6841/00276690.pdf","startPage":"1779","endPage":"1784 vol.3","publicationTitle":"[Conference Record] GLOBECOM '92 - Communications for Global Users: IEEE","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.1992.276690","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GLOCOM.1992.276690","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6841","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=276690","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Iterative decoding for multilevel codes using reliability information","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Iterative decoding","Modulation coding","Convolutional codes","Parity check codes","Additive white noise","Bit error rate","Interleaved codes","Gain","Signal to noise ratio","Added delay"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["block codes","convolutional codes","decoding","iterative methods","reliability","white noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["block codes","punctured convolutional codes","SNR","multilevel codes","reliability information","signal set","convolutional codes","multistage decoding","parity check codes","additive white Gaussian noise","decoder structure","bit error rate","iterative decoding","signal-to-noise ratio","decoder delay"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/276690/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-9 Dec 1992","displayDocTitle":"Iterative decoding for multilevel codes using reliability information","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1992","accessionNumber":"4487876","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"6-9 Dec. 1992","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Iterative decoding for multilevel codes using reliability information","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"00276690.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04482S","chronDate":"6-9 Dec 1992","isNumber":"6841","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"645","citationCount":"16","articleId":"276690","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":276692,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The basic idea is to use multiple trellis codes with a signal set which is the Cartesian product of the even and odd subsets in the pi /4-QPSK signal constellation. Several good codes with a multiplicity of 2 are designed. Among them are an 8-state, rate 3/2 code with a throughput of 1.5 b/symbol and a 16-state, rate 2/2 code with a throughput of unity. The former can provide a second-order diversity effect in fading applications while the latter can provide a fifth-order diversity. In the AWGN (additive white Gaussian noise) channel, the rate 3/2 code is about .8 dB more energy efficient than the rate 2/2 code. Both codes compare favorably with conventional systems that use pi /4-QPSK in conjunction with convolutional coding. Based on the results obtained, it appears that trellis-coded modulation is a possible alternative to convolution code.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.1992.276695","publicationTitle":"[Conference Record] GLOBECOM '92 - Communications for Global Users: IEEE","displayPublicationTitle":"[Conference Record] GLOBECOM '92 - Communications for Global Users: IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel2/645/6841/00276695.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GLOCOM.1992.276695","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6841","startPage":"1807","endPage":"1812 vol.3","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Trellis coding of pi /4-QPSK signals for AWGN and fading channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=276695","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Trellis coding of pi /4-QPSK signals for AWGN and fading channels","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-9 Dec 1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/276695/","conferenceDate":"6-9 Dec. 1992","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1992","accessionNumber":"4487881","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Trellis coding of pi /4-QPSK signals for AWGN and fading channels","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"00276695.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045527S","chronDate":"6-9 Dec 1992","isNumber":"6841","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"645","citationCount":"3","articleId":"276695","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":276696,"authors":[{"name":"J.M.

Simulation results show that when the ratio of RMS delay spread to bit duration is greater than about 0.02, the irreducible average BER is not only a function of RMS delay spread, but is also a function of the temporal and spatial distribution of individual multipath components in the complex channel impulse response. The results show that fading caused by multipath cancellation is the major error mechanism over a local area for RMS delay spreads smaller than 0.02-b duration. An example of BERSIM's real time output is shown for the transmission of a video image through a mobile radio system.

Future 32QAM modulation will also be possible for synchronous STM1 155.52-Mb/s signals. The hardware implementation of a 32QAM modem, including measurement results, is presented.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.1992.276701","publicationTitle":"[Conference Record] GLOBECOM '92 - Communications for Global Users: IEEE","displayPublicationTitle":"[Conference Record] GLOBECOM '92 - Communications for Global Users: IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel2/645/6841/00276701.pdf","startPage":"1840","endPage":"1845 vol.3","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GLOCOM.1992.276701","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6841","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new 32QAM modem for doubling transmission capacity in 40 MHz channelling plans","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=276701","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-9 Dec 1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/276701/","displayDocTitle":"A new 32QAM modem for doubling transmission capacity in 40 MHz channelling plans","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1992","accessionNumber":"4487887","conferenceDate":"6-9 Dec. 1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new 32QAM modem for doubling transmission capacity in 40 MHz channelling plans","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"00276701.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.0416S","chronDate":"6-9 Dec 1992","isNumber":"6841","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"645","articleId":"276701","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":276705,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Phase control of the microwave signal is also possible, since the microwave oscillator is enslaved by the laser pulses through phase-locking.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6842","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWSYM.1993.276739","publicationTitle":"1993 IEEE MTT-S International Microwave Symposium Digest","displayPublicationTitle":"1993 IEEE MTT-S International Microwave Symposium Digest","pdfPath":"/iel2/694/6842/00276739.pdf","startPage":"1387","endPage":"1390 vol.3","doi":"10.1109/MWSYM.1993.276739","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Broadband and real-time waveform sampling using optic-microwave phase-locking","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 June 1993","displayDocTitle":"Broadband and real-time waveform sampling using optic-microwave phase-locking","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"14-18 June 1993","publicationDate":"1993","accessionNumber":"4534268","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/276739/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Broadband and real-time waveform sampling using optic-microwave phase-locking","confLoc":"Atlanta, GA, USA","sourcePdf":"00276739.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.027662S","chronDate":"14-18 June 1993","isNumber":"6842","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"694","citationCount":"1","articleId":"276739","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":276743,"authors":[{"name":"J.W.

The amplifier, called UBIC-PA (unbalanced bias cascode power amplifier), makes very compact monolithic integration possible in spite of the considerably low frequency of 900 MHz. The UBIC-PA has more than 40 dB gain, 29 dBm output power, and 62% power added efficiency at the supplied voltage of 6 V. The chip size of the MMIC without an output matching circuit is 2.4*2.4 mm. The size and cost of the UBIC-PA module is estimated at about 1/6 (0.2 cc) and 1/2 that of the former hybrid PA module. Moreover, the UBIC-PA improves power dissipation by more than 50% under medium and low output power conditions.

The use of the curvilinear FDTD approach circumvents the staircasing problem that arises in the transmission line matrix (TLM) method as well as in the conventional FDTD approach based on the Yee-grid, and, consequently, makes it possible to accurately model arbitrary geometries without the use of a very fine mesh. The curvilinear FDTD method is more accurate than other proposed FDTD approaches or nonorthogonal grids; this superior accuracy is accomplished by transforming Maxwell's equations from curvilinear space into a regular, rectilinear domain.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"1993 IEEE MTT-S International Microwave Symposium Digest","pdfPath":"/iel2/694/6842/00276767.pdf","startPage":"741","endPage":"744 vol.2","publicationTitle":"1993 IEEE MTT-S International Microwave Symposium Digest","doi":"10.1109/MWSYM.1993.276767","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWSYM.1993.276767","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6842","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=276767","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modeling of discontinuities in microwave and millimeter wave integrated circuits using the curvilinear finite difference time domain approach","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Integrated circuit modeling","Millimeter wave integrated circuits","Microwave integrated circuits","Finite difference methods","Time domain analysis","Transmission line matrix methods","Millimeter wave technology","Transmission line discontinuities","Microstrip","Solid modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["finite difference time-domain analysis","microstrip lines","microwave integrated circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["millimeter wave integrated circuits","curvilinear finite difference time domain approach","full-wave approach","microstrip lines","arbitrary geometries","Maxwell's equations","rectilinear domain"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/276767/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 June 1993","displayDocTitle":"Modeling of discontinuities in microwave and millimeter wave integrated circuits using the curvilinear finite difference time domain approach","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1993","accessionNumber":"4534240","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"14-18 June 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modeling of discontinuities in microwave and millimeter wave integrated circuits using the curvilinear finite difference time domain approach","confLoc":"Atlanta, GA, USA","sourcePdf":"00276767.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048248S","chronDate":"14-18 June 1993","isNumber":"6842","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"694","articleId":"276767","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":276769,"authors":[{"name":"M.W.

The measured noise temperature of 15 K (noise figure of 0.2 dB) for a multistage 40-45-GHz amplifier with 33 dB of gain at the ambient of 18 K is in close agreement with the prediction of a simple noise model. A very low power consumption per stage of less than 1 mW is recorded. The noise temperature of the E-band cryogenic amplifier is less than 47 K at 70 GHz, demonstrating that the performance of HEMT receivers is now competitive with that of SIS (superconductor-insulator-superconductor) receivers in the 3-mm wavelength atmospheric window.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 June 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/276769/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1993","accessionNumber":"4534238","conferenceDate":"14-18 June 1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","displayDocTitle":"Millimeter-wave, cryogenically-coolable amplifiers using AlInAs/GaInAs/InP HEMTs","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Millimeter-wave, cryogenically-coolable amplifiers using AlInAs/GaInAs/InP HEMTs","confLoc":"Atlanta, GA, USA","sourcePdf":"00276769.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063561S","chronDate":"14-18 June 1993","isNumber":"6842","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"694","citationCount":"38","articleId":"276769","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":276771,"authors":[{"name":"S.K.

A full-wave analysis is employed to rigorously characterize a microstrip circuit, which results in a finite set of pairs of input and output parameter vectors. The neurons, arranged as a three-layer network, are used to learn the mappings from input to output and then give accurate approximations for the output vectors at any arbitrary input. It is emphasized that a three-layer neural network is capable of performing any mapping if the right connections among the neurons can be made. A real example involving microstrip corporate feed design is given to illustrate the potential power of this technique.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/MWSYM.1993.276791","publicationTitle":"1993 IEEE MTT-S International Microwave Symposium Digest","displayPublicationTitle":"1993 IEEE MTT-S International Microwave Symposium Digest","pdfPath":"/iel2/694/6842/00276791.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWSYM.1993.276791","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6842","startPage":"413","endPage":"416 vol.1","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Microstrip circuit design using neural networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=276791","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Microstrip circuit design using neural networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 June 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/276791/","conferenceDate":"14-18 June 1993","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1993","accessionNumber":"4534216","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Microstrip circuit design using neural networks","confLoc":"Atlanta, GA, USA","sourcePdf":"00276791.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052877S","chronDate":"14-18 June 1993","isNumber":"6842","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"694","citationCount":"25","articleId":"276791","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":276805,"authors":[{"name":"A.

These linearizers operate at C, X, and Ku-band, and are based on a passive FET design similar to that of MMIC switches and attenuators. MESFET varactors and voltage variable resistors are used as control elements. More than 2.5 GHz of bandwidth is obtained at Ku-band with an improvement of greater than 10 dB in TWTA carrier-to-intermodulation ratio (C/I), and a phase change of less than 5 degrees . Linearizer insertion loss was reduced to below 8 dB at C-band and 10 dB at Ku-band. The MMICs also verified the soundness of the CAD (computer-aided design) modeling techniques used to develop the chips, and the value of the unique MMIC air bridge over metal tuning technique incorporated into the designs.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"1993 IEEE MTT-S International Microwave Symposium Digest","pdfPath":"/iel2/694/6842/00276805.pdf","startPage":"353","endPage":"356 vol.1","publicationTitle":"1993 IEEE MTT-S International Microwave Symposium Digest","doi":"10.1109/MWSYM.1993.276805","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWSYM.1993.276805","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6842","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=276805","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Passive FET MMIC linearizers for C, X, and Ku-band satellite applications","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field effect MMICs","Satellites","Design automation","Microwave measurements","Integrated circuit measurements","Gallium arsenide","Microwave integrated circuits","Microwave FET integrated circuits","Monolithic integrated circuits","Microwave amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["circuit CAD","field effect integrated circuits","gallium arsenide","III-V semiconductors","microwave amplifiers","MMIC","satellite relay systems","travelling-wave-tubes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["C-band","X-band","FET MMIC linearizers","Ku-band","satellite applications","spaceborne traveling wave tube amplifiers","MESFET varactors","voltage variable resistors","control elements","carrier-to-intermodulation ratio","phase change","insertion loss","CAD","air bridge","GaAs"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/276805/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 June 1993","displayDocTitle":"Passive FET MMIC linearizers for C, X, and Ku-band satellite applications","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1993","accessionNumber":"4534202","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"14-18 June 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Passive FET MMIC linearizers for C, X, and Ku-band satellite applications","confLoc":"Atlanta, GA, USA","sourcePdf":"00276805.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.029029S","chronDate":"14-18 June 1993","isNumber":"6842","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"694","citationCount":"16","articleId":"276805","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":276807,"authors":[{"name":"L.

Broadband filter characteristics can easily be achieved by using chirped components. The inherently good stopband rejection of the new structure has been further improved by applying proper weighting techniques to the IDTs and reflectors. A filter with a relative bandwidth of 10% and a center frequency of 200 MHz has been designed by means of a novel synthesis method. The filter has been fabricated on 128 degrees Y-X LiNbO/sub 3/. A minimum insertion loss of 4 dB, a small passband ripple of about 1 dB, and a stopband rejection of better than 35 dB were measured. Excellent agreement between simulation and measurement has been found.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/MWSYM.1993.276856","publicationTitle":"1993 IEEE MTT-S International Microwave Symposium Digest","displayPublicationTitle":"1993 IEEE MTT-S International Microwave Symposium Digest","pdfPath":"/iel2/694/6842/00276856.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWSYM.1993.276856","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6842","startPage":"1501","endPage":"1504 vol.3","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new low loss SAW filter structure with extremely wide bandwidth for mobile communication systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=276856","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A new low loss SAW filter structure with extremely wide bandwidth for mobile communication systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 June 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/276856/","conferenceDate":"14-18 June 1993","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1993","accessionNumber":"4529302","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new low loss SAW filter structure with extremely wide bandwidth for mobile communication systems","confLoc":"Atlanta, GA, USA","sourcePdf":"00276856.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.155948S","chronDate":"14-18 June 1993","isNumber":"6842","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"694","citationCount":"8","articleId":"276856","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":276862,"authors":[{"name":"J.A.

The method uses orthogonally polarized fields to isolate the input and output waves of a two-dimensional array of solid-state amplifiers. To demonstrate this technique, a proof-of-concept model was developed using a 69-element array of orthogonally polarized elements at 17 GHz. The proposed approach eliminates many of the problems associated with the feedthrough spatial power combiner because all the RF power is confined to just one side of the array. This allows the backside of the array to be used for heat sinking and bias connections. It also reduces the size to half that of the feedthrough combiner. The proposed spatial power combining technique holds the potential for producing high power amplification for communication and radar applications at millimeter-wave bands from solid-state transistor devices.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/MWSYM.1993.276862","displayPublicationTitle":"1993 IEEE MTT-S International Microwave Symposium Digest","pdfPath":"/iel2/694/6842/00276862.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6842","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWSYM.1993.276862","publicationTitle":"1993 IEEE MTT-S International Microwave Symposium Digest","startPage":"619","endPage":"622 vol.2","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spatial power combining for millimeter-wave solid state amplifiers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=276862","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 June 1993","displayDocTitle":"Spatial power combining for millimeter-wave solid state amplifiers","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/276862/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1993","accessionNumber":"4529296","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"14-18 June 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spatial power combining for millimeter-wave solid state amplifiers","confLoc":"Atlanta, GA, USA","sourcePdf":"00276862.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.028609S","chronDate":"14-18 June 1993","isNumber":"6842","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"694","citationCount":"16","articleId":"276862","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":276871,"authors":[{"name":"D.

The behavior of the attenuation pole is explained by the relation between even-odd mode impedances and an equivalent expression with lumped elements.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"1993 IEEE MTT-S International Microwave Symposium Digest","pdfPath":"/iel2/694/6842/00276916.pdf","startPage":"177","endPage":"180 vol.1","publicationTitle":"1993 IEEE MTT-S International Microwave Symposium Digest","doi":"10.1109/MWSYM.1993.276916","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWSYM.1993.276916","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6842","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=276916","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A very small dielectric planar filter for portable telephones","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Dielectrics","Telephony","Resonator filters","Nonhomogeneous media","Coupling circuits","Electromagnetic coupling","Attenuation","Impedance","Strips","Capacitors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["active filters","bismuth compounds","calcium compounds","ceramics","dielectric resonators","mobile radio systems","radio equipment","radiofrequency filters","radiotelephony"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dielectric planar filter","portable telephones","high-permittivity multilayer ceramic","transmission characteristic","attenuation pole feature","even-odd mode impedances","lumped elements","BiCaNbO"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/276916/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 June 1993","displayDocTitle":"A very small dielectric planar filter for portable telephones","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1993","accessionNumber":"4518511","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"14-18 June 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A very small dielectric planar filter for portable telephones","confLoc":"Atlanta, GA, USA","sourcePdf":"00276916.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.029199S","chronDate":"14-18 June 1993","isNumber":"6842","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"694","citationCount":"5","articleId":"276916","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-02"},{"_id":276919,"authors":[{"name":"G.S.

These nonlinearities were combined into a single nonlinear model constructed from a number of elementary linear and nonlinear elements. The nonlinear circuit equations were incorporated as a user-defined model in LIBRA to perform the harmonic balance technique.

Results obtained using the FDTD method are compared with experimental measurements made on phantoms, and excellent agreement is obtained. It is found both experimentally and theoretically that at low phantom conductivities the penetration depth is almost independent of conductivity due to the presence of circulating currents. In addition, the SAR pattern (calculated and measured) shows two null spots whose positions are correctly predicted by the FDTD method and match experimental measurements.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"1993 IEEE MTT-S International Microwave Symposium Digest","pdfPath":"/iel2/694/6842/00277075.pdf","startPage":"1151","endPage":"1154 vol.2","publicationTitle":"1993 IEEE MTT-S International Microwave Symposium Digest","doi":"10.1109/MWSYM.1993.277075","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWSYM.1993.277075","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6842","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=277075","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Finite difference time domain modelling of hyperthermia applicators for cancer therapy","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Finite difference methods","Hyperthermia","Applicators","Cancer","Medical treatment","Imaging phantoms","Conductivity","Position measurement","Time domain analysis","Specific absorption rate"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biothermics","finite difference time-domain analysis","radiation therapy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hyperthermia applicators","cancer therapy","finite-difference-time-domain","field penetration","specific absorption rate","sheet applicator","hyperthermia treatment","three-dimensional dielectric boundaries","nonuniform grid","computational efficiency","FDTD method","phantoms","phantom conductivities","circulating currents","null spots"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/277075/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 June 1993","displayDocTitle":"Finite difference time domain modelling of hyperthermia applicators for cancer therapy","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1993","accessionNumber":"4540622","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"14-18 June 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Finite difference time domain modelling of hyperthermia applicators for cancer therapy","confLoc":"Atlanta, GA, USA","sourcePdf":"00277075.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062643S","chronDate":"14-18 June 1993","isNumber":"6842","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"694","citationCount":"4","articleId":"277075","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":277082,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The design of pseudo-interdigital filters with improved skirt performance is discussed. Experimental and theoretical results are presented for superconducting filters, hybrids, and a fully integrated C-band diplexer. It is noted that the extra coupling which exists between nonadjacent resonators in pseudo-interdigital filters may be used to improve the rejection performance on the high-frequency skirt. Filters with such rejection performance are suitable for use in the design of HTS hybrid-coupled multiplexers and diplexers. The experimental results reported here for superconducting filters, hybrids and the fully integrated C-band diplexer demonstrate the possibility of building such components with no tuning elements.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/277108/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 June 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4553010","conferenceDate":"14-18 June 1993","displayDocTitle":"Design of hybrid-coupled multiplexers and diplexers using asymmetrical superconducting filters","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of hybrid-coupled multiplexers and diplexers using asymmetrical superconducting filters","confLoc":"Atlanta, GA, USA","sourcePdf":"00277108.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042774S","chronDate":"14-18 June 1993","isNumber":"6842","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"694","citationCount":"16","articleId":"277108","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":277123,"authors":[{"name":"S.M.J.

The bi-polar near-field scanner incorporates an axially rotating test antenna and a rotating probe-carrying arm to sample the near-field on a data grid consisting of concentric circles and radial arcs. This technique offers a large scan plane size with reduced \"real estate\" requirements and a simple mechanical implementation resulting in a highly accurate and cost-effective antenna measurement and diagnostic system. Part I of this two-part paper gives an introduction to the bi-polar near-field technique and a description of the unique hardware implementation at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). Measured results are compared with those produced by a far-field range and a plane-rectangular planar near-field range to verify the implementation and validate the method. Excellent agreement was obtained for both the co-polarized and cross-polarized fields.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/8.277212","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/8.277212","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6844","startPage":"184","endPage":"195","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel4/8/6844/00277212.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=277212","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Measurement techniques","Antenna measurements","Electromagnetic measurements","Mechanical variables measurement","Probes","Testing","Student members","Hardware","Data processing","Holography"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna testing","antenna radiation patterns"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bipolar planar near-field measurement","antenna measurement","bipolar near-field scanner","test antenna","rotating probe-carrying arm","data grid","antenna diagnostic system","University of California","UCLA","far-field range","plane-rectangular planar near-field range","cross-polarized fields","copolarized fields"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"The bi-polar planar near-field measurement technique, part I: implementation and measurement comparisons","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1994","isJournal":true,"volume":"42","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 1994","accessionNumber":"4671067","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/277212/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The bi-polar planar near-field measurement technique, part I: implementation and measurement comparisons","sourcePdf":"00277212.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.029875S","chronDate":"Feb 1994","isNumber":"6844","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"45","articleId":"277212","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2022-01-15"},{"_id":277213,"authors":[{"name":"R.G.

This bipolar technique offers a large scan plane size with minimal \"real-estate\" requirements and a simple mechanical implementation, requiring only rotational motions, resulting in a highly accurate and cost-effective antenna measurement and diagnostic system. Part I of this two-part paper introduced the bi-polar planar near-field measurement concept, discussed the implementation of this technique at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), and provided a comparative survey of measured results. This paper examines the data processing algorithms that have been developed and customized to exploit the unique features of the bi-polar planar near-field measurement technique. Near-field to far-field transformation algorithms investigated include both interpolatory and non-interpolatory algorithms due to the a typical arrangement of the bi-polar near-field samples. The algorithms which have been tailored for the bi-polar configuration include the optimal sampling interpolation (OSI)/fast Fourier transform (FFT), Jacobi-Bessel transform, and Fourier-Bessel transform. Additionally, holographic imaging for determination of antenna aperture fields has been incorporated to facilitate antenna diagnostics. Results for a simulated measurement of an array of infinitesimal dipoles and a measured waveguide-fed slot array antenna are included. Appropriate guidelines with respect to the advantages and disadvantages of the various processing algorithms are provided.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/8.277213","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/8.277213","startPage":"196","endPage":"204","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel4/8/6844/00277213.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6844","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The bi-polar planar near-field measurement technique, part II: near-field to far-field transformation and holographic imaging methods","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1994","displayDocTitle":"The bi-polar planar near-field measurement technique, part II: near-field to far-field transformation and holographic imaging methods","publicationDate":"Feb. 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","volume":"42","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4671068","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/277213/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The bi-polar planar near-field measurement technique, part II: near-field to far-field transformation and holographic imaging methods","sourcePdf":"00277213.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044531S","chronDate":"Feb 1994","isNumber":"6844","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"45","articleId":"277213","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":277217,"authors":[{"name":"W.

The web and void design of the individual blocks and their arrangement within a wall creates a periodic structure, which exhibits frequency dependent transmission and reflections characteristics in the UHF bands proposed for future Personal Communication Systems (PCS). For higher frequencies, higher order Floquet modes excited at the periodic structure can propagate away from the wall, suggesting that significant power can be carried away from the wall in non-specular directions. Indoor propagation prediction models must consider the non-specular paths exited by walls with a periodic nature in order to account for all of the scattered power. In this work, plane wave reflection and transmission characteristics for typical concrete block walls are examined theoretically and experimentally to determine the frequency dependence of the specularly and non-specularly transmitted and reflected fields.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/8.277217","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel4/8/6844/00277217.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/8.277217","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6844","startPage":"232","endPage":"239","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00277217.png","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Transmission and reflection characteristics at concrete block walls in the UHF bands proposed for future PCS","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=277217","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Transmission and reflection characteristics at concrete block walls in the UHF bands proposed for future PCS","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/277217/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1994","isJournal":true,"volume":"42","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 1994","accessionNumber":"4671072","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Transmission and reflection characteristics at concrete block walls in the UHF bands proposed for future PCS","sourcePdf":"00277217.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.053678S","chronDate":"Feb 1994","isNumber":"6844","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"62","articleId":"277217","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":277225,"authors":[{"name":"C.J.

The technique described is fully general and only requires a knowledge of the associated mill space of the desired inverse. While an analytical representation of the null vector is desirable, ultimately the calculations are done numerically so that a numerical knowledge of the associated full vector is sufficient. This method first characterizes repeatable strategies using a set of orthonormal basis functions to describe the null space of these transformations. The optimal repeatable inverse is then obtained by projecting the null space of the desired generalized inverse onto each of these basis functions. The resulting inverse is guaranteed to be the closest repeatable inverse to the desired inverse, in an integral norm sense, from the set of all inverses spanned by the selected basis functions. This technique is illustrated for a planar, three-degree-of-freedom manipulator and a seven-degree-of-freedom spatial manipulator.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/9.277234","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","pdfPath":"/iel4/9/6845/00277234.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/9.277234","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6845","startPage":"689","endPage":"699","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Repeatable generalized inverse control strategies for kinematically redundant manipulators","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=277234","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Repeatable generalized inverse control strategies for kinematically redundant manipulators","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/277234/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1993","isJournal":true,"volume":"38","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 1993","accessionNumber":"4480125","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Repeatable generalized inverse control strategies for kinematically redundant manipulators","sourcePdf":"00277234.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036355S","chronDate":"May 1993","isNumber":"6845","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9","citationCount":"47","articleId":"277234","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":277235,"authors":[{"name":"R.M.

This is accomplished by first converting the hybrid system into an equivalent infinite-dimensional discrete-time system using the lifting technique in continuous time, and then approximating the infinite-dimensional parts of the system which model the intersample dynamics. A thorough analysis of the approximation procedure is presented, and it is shown that it is convergent at the rate of 1/n. Explicit bounds that are independent of the controller are obtained to characterize the approximation. It is also shown that the geometry of the induced norm for the sampled-data problem is different from that of the standard l/sup 1/ norm, and hence there might not exist a linear isometry that maps the sampled-data problem exactly to a standard discrete-time problem.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/277236/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1993","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"May 1993","accessionNumber":"4480127","volume":"38","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Minimization of the L/sup infinity /-induced norm for sampled-data systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Minimization of the L/sup infinity /-induced norm for sampled-data systems","sourcePdf":"00277236.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.03719S","chronDate":"May 1993","isNumber":"6845","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9","citationCount":"46","articleId":"277236","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":277238,"authors":[{"name":"G.

The reconfigurable mesh captures salient features from a variety of sources, including the CAAPP, CHiP, polymorphic-torus network, and bus automation. It consists of an array of processors interconnected by a reconfigurable bus system that can be used to dynamically obtain various interconnection patterns between the processors. A variety of fundamental data-movement operations for the reconfigurable mesh are introduced. Based on these operations, algorithms that are efficient for solving a variety of problems involving graphs and digitized images are also introduced. The algorithms are asymptotically superior to those previously obtained for the aforementioned reconfigurable architectures, as well as to those previously obtained for the mesh, the mesh with multiple broadcasting, the mesh with multiple buses, the mesh-of-trees, and the pyramid computer. The power of reconfigurability is illustrated by solving some problems, such as the exclusive OR, more efficiently on the reconfigurable mesh than is possible on the programmable random-access memory (PRAM).<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel1/12/6847/00277290.pdf","startPage":"678","endPage":"692","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","doi":"10.1109/12.277290","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/12.277290","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6847","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=277290","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Parallel computations on reconfigurable meshes","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Concurrent computing","Broadcasting","Computational modeling","Phase change random access memory","Laboratories","Computer science","Computer networks","Automata","Reconfigurable architectures","Parallel algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","multiprocessor interconnection networks","parallel algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["parallel algorithms, complexity","reconfigurable meshes","model of computation","reconfigurable architectures","reconfigurability","PRAM"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/277290/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1993","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1993","displayDocTitle":"Parallel computations on reconfigurable meshes","volume":"42","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 1993","accessionNumber":"4525850","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Parallel computations on reconfigurable meshes","sourcePdf":"00277290.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.193774S","chronDate":"Jun 1993","isNumber":"6847","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"176","articleId":"277290","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":277291,"authors":[{"name":"I.

Consequently, models for yield analysis have been proposed for large-area clustering and small-area clustering, based on the two-parameter negative-binomial distribution. The addition of a new parameter, the block size, to the two existing parameters of the fault distribution is proposed.

The model is based on general physical principles, and provides consistent topologies for both large and small signal simulations to frequencies above f/sub t/ and over a wide range of node voltages. The procedure for extracting model elements includes deembedding linear parasitic elements and extracting bicubic, B-spline functions, which represent large signal model elements. The spline coefficients are calculated using a constrained least squares fit to a set of small signal parameters and/or DC currents that have been measured at a number of node voltage values. Advantages of this approach include fast parameter extraction for new FET structures, accuracy, computational efficiency, charge conservation, and the requirement of only a single model for all simulation modes. The model can also be used to interface device simulators (e.g., PISCES) with circuit simulators for accurate predictive modeling.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/16.277326","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel1/16/6849/00277326.pdf","startPage":"1723","endPage":"1729","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6849","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/16.277326","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1993","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1993","displayDocTitle":"A universal large/small signal 3-terminal FET model using a nonquasistatic charge-based approach","volume":"40","issue":"10","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Oct. 1993","accessionNumber":"4561583","isJournal":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/277326/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A universal large/small signal 3-terminal FET model using a nonquasistatic charge-based approach","sourcePdf":"00277326.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.049557S","chronDate":"Oct 1993","isNumber":"6849","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"43","articleId":"277326","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":277329,"authors":[{"name":"F.J.

Brews et al. (see IEEE Electron Dev. Lett., vol EDL-1, p.2, 1980). This formula can be used as a good starting point before device fine tuning, and works well above 0.5 mu m in channel length. It is expected, however, that for channel lengths below 0.5 mu m, it becomes inaccurate because of the nature of the equation. The erroneous implication is that if gate oxide or junction depth approaches zero, the channel length can be reduced to zero without short-channel effects. A formula in which the functions are modified to correct this anomaly is presented. Another important improvement is that the degree of short-channel effect is left as an input variable to fit the different requirements of circuits. The revised formula has been shown to be accurate down to 0.1- mu m channel length.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel1/16/6849/00277356.pdf","startPage":"1895","endPage":"1897","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","doi":"10.1109/16.277356","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/16.277356","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6849","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=277356","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An improved generalized guide for MOSFET scaling","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MOSFET circuits","Equations","Doping","Threshold voltage","Input variables","Analytical models","Predictive models","Computer simulation","Guidelines","Subthreshold current"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["insulated gate field effect transistors","integrated circuit technology","MOS integrated circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["scaling guide","MOSFET scaling","channel length","short-channel effect","0.1 to 0.5 micron"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/277356/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1993","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1993","displayDocTitle":"An improved generalized guide for MOSFET scaling","volume":"40","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 1993","accessionNumber":"4561614","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An improved generalized guide for MOSFET scaling","sourcePdf":"00277356.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.028028S","chronDate":"Oct 1993","isNumber":"6849","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"22","articleId":"277356","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":277374,"authors":[{"name":"T.-J.

The resistivity of heavily doped p-type (P/sup +/) poly-Si/sub 1/spl minus/x/Ge/sub x/ is much lower than that of comparably doped poly-Si, because higher levels of boron activation and higher hole mobilities are achieved in poly-Si/sub 1/spl minus/x/Ge/sub x/. The resistivity of heavily doped n-type (N/sup +/) poly-S/sub 1/spl minus/x/Ge/sub x/ is similar to that of comparably doped poly-Si for x<0.45; however, it is considerably higher for larger Ge mole fractions due to significant reductions in phosphorus activation. Lower temperatures (/spl sim/500/spl deg/C), as well as lower implant doses, are sufficient to achieve low resistivities in boron-implanted poly-Si/sub 1/spl minus/x/Ge/sub x/ films, compared to poly-Si films. The work function of P/sup +/ poly-Si/sub 1/spl minus/x/Ge/sub x/ decreases significantly (by up to /spl sim/0.4 Volts), whereas the work function of N/sup +/ poly-Si/sub 1/spl minus/x/Ge/sub x/ decreases only slightly, as Ge content is increased. Estimates of the energy bandgap of poly-Si/sub 1/spl minus/x/Ge/sub x/ show a reduction (relative to the bandgap of poly-Si) similar to that observed for unstrained single-crystalline Si/sub 1/spl minus/x/Ge/sub x/ for a 26% Ge film, and a reduction closer to that observed for strained single-crystalline Si/sub 1/spl minus/x/Ge/sub x/ for a 56% Ge film. The electrical properties of poly-Si/sub 1/spl minus/x/Ge/sub x/ make it a potentially favorable alternative to poly-Si for P/sup +/ gate-material applications in metal-oxide-semiconductor technologies and also for p-channel thin-film transistor applications.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel1/16/6850/00277374.pdf","startPage":"228","endPage":"232","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","doi":"10.1109/16.277374","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/16.277374","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6850","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=277374","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Electrical properties of heavily doped polycrystalline silicon-germanium films","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Semiconductor films","Conductivity","Photonic band gap","Germanium silicon alloys","Silicon germanium","Ion implantation","Boron","Temperature","Implants","Thin film transistors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Ge-Si alloys","semiconductor materials","heavily doped semiconductors","semiconductor thin films","ion implantation","carrier mobility","work function","electronic conduction in crystalline semiconductor thin films","rapid thermal processing","annealing","energy gap","boron","phosphorus"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electrical properties","heavily doped polycrystalline films","poly-Si/sub 1/spl minus/x/Ge/sub x/","high-dose ion implantation","resistivity","p-type","B activation","hole mobilities","n-type","Ge mole fractions","P activation","work function","energy bandgap","P/sup +/ gate-material applications","metal-oxide-semiconductor technologies","p-channel TFT applications","thin-film transistor applications","RTA","semiconductors","500 C","SiGe:B","SiGe:P"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/277374/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1994","displayDocTitle":"Electrical properties of heavily doped polycrystalline silicon-germanium films","volume":"41","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 1994","accessionNumber":"4655140","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Electrical properties of heavily doped polycrystalline silicon-germanium films","sourcePdf":"00277374.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.031996S","chronDate":"Feb 1994","isNumber":"6850","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"110","articleId":"277374","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":277375,"authors":[{"name":"S.S.

Below 150 K, we believe that impact ionization due to the increasing carrier mean free path leads to the observed increase in the leakage current with decreasing temperature.

The aperture admittance characteristics of a flange mounted rectangular waveguide radiating into a layered, generally lossy dielectric media backed or unbacked by a conducting sheet is modeled. The theoretical implementation is based on a Fourier transform boundary matching technique to construct the field components in each medium, coupled with a stationary form of the terminating aperture admittance of the waveguide. The model can serve as a reliable test bed for real-time examination of layered composite media. Experimental results for several cases are presented which show good agreement with the theoretical findings.

The method originates from the classical nodal shift measurement technique for waveguide discontinuities, and is closely related to the transverse resonance technique (TRT). The method differs from the TRT in two important ways. First and foremost, the tedious search required in the TRT approach for the three sets of cavity lengths that satisfy the resonance condition at each of the specified frequencies of interest, is avoided in the present method. It is replaced, instead, with the problem of computing the resonant frequencies of the cavity for a number of different, systematically-chosen, longitudinal dimensions. The frequency behaviors of the S-parameters are reconstructed later for a wide band of frequencies from the sampled resonant frequency data by using an interpolation procedure described in the paper. Second, the finite element method (FEM) employing vector finite elements is used in conjunction with the numerically efficient Lanczos algorithm to compute the cavity resonant frequencies in an iterative manner. Several waveguide and microstrip line discontinuity problems have been analyzed by using this method. Numerical results are compared with available data.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/22.277437","startPage":"433","endPage":"440","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel1/22/6852/00277437.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/22.277437","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6852","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A finite element cavity resonance method for waveguide and microstrip line discontinuity problems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Finite element methods","Resonance","Waveguide discontinuities","Resonant frequency","Microstrip","Measurement techniques","Scattering parameters","Wideband","Interpolation","Iterative algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["resonance","interpolation","finite element analysis","S-parameters","cavity resonators","waveguide theory","microstrip lines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["finite element cavity resonance method","microstrip line discontinuity problem","waveguide discontinuities","nodal shift measurement technique","transverse resonance technique","resonant frequencies","S-parameters","sampled resonant frequency data","interpolation procedure","FEM","finite element method","vector finite elements","Lanczos algorithm"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/277437/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1994","displayDocTitle":"A finite element cavity resonance method for waveguide and microstrip line discontinuity problems","volume":"42","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4684228","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A finite element cavity resonance method for waveguide and microstrip line discontinuity problems","sourcePdf":"00277437.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.048388S","chronDate":"Mar 1994","isNumber":"6852","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"17","articleId":"277437","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":277438,"authors":[{"name":"J.-S.

While the application of FEM for the analysis of MMIC structures is not new, to the best of the knowledge of the authors the technique for mesh truncation for microstrip lines using the first and higher-order ABC's, described in this paper, has not been reported elsewhere. The scattering parameters of a microstrip discontinuity are computed in two steps. As a first step, the field distribution of the fundamental mode in a uniform microstrip is obtained by exciting the uniform line with the quasi-static transverse electric field, letting it propagate, and then extracting the dominant mode pattern after the higher order modes have decayed. In step two, the discontinuity problem is solved by exciting the structure by using the fundamental mode obtained in step one. The scattering parameters based on the voltage definition are calculated by using the line integral of electric fields underneath the strip.

The electric field distributions in the pillbox were calculated using the MAFIA code. The trajectory of emitted electrons to the surface of an alumina window disk in the calculated electric field was simulated. The energy deposition distribution of electrons impinging on the alumina disk was also obtained. The results agree well with the discoloring patterns observed for alumina disks after RF operation. This shows that the discoloring can be explained in terms of the bombardment of single-surface multipactoring electrons. Knowledge concerning the electric field distribution and the behavior of multipactoring electrons in the pillbox RF window will be useful in designing RF windows from an electrical point of view.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel1/23/6853/00277497.pdf","startPage":"278","endPage":"282","doi":"10.1109/23.277497","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/23.277497","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6853","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Trajectory simulation of multipactoring electrons in an S-band pillbox RF window","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/277497/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April  1992","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  1992","displayDocTitle":"Trajectory simulation of multipactoring electrons in an S-band pillbox RF window","publicationDate":"April 1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4196046","isJournal":true,"volume":"39","issue":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Trajectory simulation of multipactoring electrons in an S-band pillbox RF window","sourcePdf":"00277497.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.035878S","chronDate":"April  1992","isNumber":"6853","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"51","articleId":"277497","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-19"},{"_id":277499,"authors":[{"name":"S.

They first recount the development of Total Dose Method 1019, and then suggest modifications and enhancements that allow the maximum utilization of 1019 for the qualification and radiation hardness assurance of parts for use in the low-dose-rate natural space environment. Examples of PIE in MOS integrated circuits show that one cannot neglect these effects, and that one must test for the possibility of post irradiation circuit failure due to rebound when the best dose rate is significantly higher than the space application dose rate. Attention is also focused on the fact that Method 1019 is often too conservative when used as a test method for the effects of trapped oxide charge (TOC) in devices to be used in the space environment. These considerations lead to a focus on two features of Method 1019: PIE testing and allowance for devices that exhibit fast annealing of TOC. The recently approved Method 1019.4 contains the PIE test prescription.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel1/23/6854/00277513.pdf","startPage":"328","endPage":"341","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/23.277513","doi":"10.1109/23.277513","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6854","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Post irradiation effects (PIE) in integrated circuits","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  1992","displayDocTitle":"Post irradiation effects (PIE) in integrated circuits","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/277513/","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"June 1992","accessionNumber":"4256414","volume":"39","issue":"3","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  1992","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Post irradiation effects (PIE) in integrated circuits","sourcePdf":"00277513.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.095539S","chronDate":"June  1992","isNumber":"6854","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"13","articleId":"277513","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":277533,"authors":[{"name":"R.

The language constructs allow the run-time system to implement optimizations that reduce recomputation and state saving overheads for optimistic simulations and synchronization overheads for conservative implementations.

This approach takes the view that a HT is a hypothesis testing method. Each sample in the HT array implements a test to determine whether a curve with the given parameters fits the edge point data. This view allows the performance of HT algorithms to be quantified. The power function, which gives the probability of rejection as a function of the underlying parametric distribution of data points, is shown to be the fundamentally important characteristic of HT behaviour. Attempting to make the power function narrow is a formal approach to optimizing HT performance. To illustrate how this framework is useful the particular problem of line detection is discussed in detail. It is shown that the hypothesis testing framework leads to a redefinition of the HT in which the values are a measure of the distribution of points around a curve rather than the number of points on a curve. This change dramatically improves the sensitivity of the method to small structures. The solution to many HT design problems can be posed within the framework, including optimal quantizations and optimum sampling of the parameter space. In this paper the authors consider the design of optimum I-D filters, which can be used to sharpen the peak structure in parameter space. Results on several real images illustrate the improvements obtained.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/34.277588","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6857","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel1/34/6857/00277588.pdf","endPage":"341","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hypothesis testing: a framework for analyzing and optimizing Hough transform performance","doi":"10.1109/34.277588","startPage":"329","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=277588","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1994","displayDocTitle":"Hypothesis testing: a framework for analyzing and optimizing Hough transform performance","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/277588/","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4679821","publicationDate":"April 1994","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"16","issue":"4","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hypothesis testing: a framework for analyzing and optimizing Hough transform performance","sourcePdf":"00277588.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041583S","chronDate":"Apr 1994","isNumber":"6857","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"50","articleId":"277588","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":277596,"authors":[{"name":"L.J.

In pattern recognition, it is often desired that this task be performed without significant loss of classification information. The Bayes error is an ideal criterion for this purpose; however, it is known to be notoriously difficult for mathematical treatment. Consequently, suboptimal criteria have been used in practice. We propose an alternative criterion, based on the estimate of the Bayes error, that is hopefully closer to the optimal criterion than the criteria currently in use. An algorithm for linear dimension reduction, based on this criterion, is conceived and implemented. Experiments demonstrate its superior performance in comparison with conventional algorithms.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/34.277596","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel1/34/6857/00277596.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/34.277596","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6857","startPage":"420","endPage":"424","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Toward Bayes-optimal linear dimension reduction","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=277596","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Toward Bayes-optimal linear dimension reduction","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/277596/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1994","isJournal":true,"volume":"16","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 1994","accessionNumber":"4679829","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Toward Bayes-optimal linear dimension reduction","sourcePdf":"00277596.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038302S","chronDate":"Apr 1994","isNumber":"6857","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"17","articleId":"277596","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":277606,"authors":[{"name":"A.

A novel method of test generation that efficiently generates test sequences for stuck-at faults in the logic circuit by exploiting register-transfer-level (RTL) design information is presented. The approach is targeted at circuits with highly connected state transition graphs (STGs) as in data paths, but explicit use is not made of the STG. The efficacy of the method stems from the use of the RTL description and good heuristics. The authors have successfully generated tests for entire chips with large numbers of latches within reasonable amounts of CPU time and have obtained maximum fault coverage. The algorithms require significantly smaller times than other test generators. A synthesis procedure that produces an optimized, fully testable logic implementation of a sequential circuit from a RTL description of the sequential circuit is also described. Datapath-controller circuits as well as digital signal processors whose STGs are very large, can be synthesized.

The self-testing or the strongly code disjoint property of this embedded checker can be lost if it is not exercised by an appropriate set of inputs. If some partial checkers are strongly code disjoint, then some undetectable faults can modify the input/output mapping of these checkers. This can compromise the exercising of the final double-rail checker especially if this modification leads to the reduction of the partial checker's output code space. In that case it will be required that the partial strongly code disjoint checkers must also be strongly fault secure. In this work we show that the (two-output) strongly code disjoint checkers do not allow such reduction of their output code space and on this basis we show that the strongly fault secure property is not necessary. We also give some techniques that ensure exercising the final checker.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6859","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel1/43/6859/00277640.pdf","doi":"10.1109/43.277640","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/43.277640","startPage":"651","endPage":"658","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fault secure property versus strongly code disjoint checkers","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/277640/","displayDocTitle":"Fault secure property versus strongly code disjoint checkers","isJournal":true,"volume":"13","issue":"5","accessionNumber":"4678633","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"May 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fault secure property versus strongly code disjoint checkers","sourcePdf":"00277640.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.078829S","chronDate":"May 1994","isNumber":"6859","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"35","articleId":"277640","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":277685,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The earth surface electric field of the MHD electromagnetic pulse is given to be of the order of 100 V/km, with a duration up to several minutes; and the electric field of the solar storms is of the order of 10 V/km, and lasts from several minutes to one hour. Both phenomena cause flow of almost direct current in the windings of power transformers through the grounding system. For long transmission lines, i.e. 300 miles or longer, this DC current offsets the 60 Hz AC and may saturate transformer cores, with secondary results such as high magnetization currents, increased harmonics, and concomitant effect on power system operation. The level of the transformer core saturation depends on the time constant of the saturation process, and on the duration and magnitude of the direct current through the transformer windings. Thus, although the solar storm electric field is much lower than MHD-EMP, the solar storm effects on the power system are greater due to their much longer duration. This paper presents a technique for the computation of the induced and/or transferred voltages and currents to an electric power system from geomagnetic disturbances. For this purpose, models of transmission lines which explicitly represent grounding, earth potential, and frequency dependent phenomena, and power transformers which explicitly represent nonlinear magnetization characteristics, are utilized.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/61.277691","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","startPage":"194","endPage":"207","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","pdfPath":"/iel3/61/6861/00277691.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/61.277691","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6861","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Comparison of SS-GIC and MHD-EMP-GIC effects on power systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power systems","Storms","Pulse power systems","Magnetohydrodynamics","EMP radiation effects","Power transformers","Grounding","Power transmission lines","Transformer cores","Magnetization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electromagnetic pulse","magnetohydrodynamics","power systems","power transmission lines","magnetic storms","power transformers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["solar storm geomagnetically induced currents","nuclear detonation geomagnetically induced currents","magnetohydrodynamic electromagnetic pulse GIC","power system","earth surface electric field","power transformer windings","DC current","long transmission lines","transformer core saturation","time constant","geomagnetic disturbances","grounding","earth potential","frequency dependent phenomena","nonlinear magnetization characteristics"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1994","displayDocTitle":"Comparison of SS-GIC and MHD-EMP-GIC effects on power systems","volume":"9","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4671830","publicationDate":"Jan. 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/277691/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparison of SS-GIC and MHD-EMP-GIC effects on power systems","sourcePdf":"00277691.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.07345S","chronDate":"Jan 1994","isNumber":"6861","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"61","citationCount":"15","articleId":"277691","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":277693,"authors":[{"name":"Hong-Tzer Yang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Hong-Tzer Yang","id":"37086991076"},{"name":"Wen-Yeau Chang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Wen-Yeau Chang","id":"37087657066"},{"name":"Ching-Lien Huang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Ching-Lien Huang","id":"37087206931"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0885-8977"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1937-4208"}],"articleNumber":"277693","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":73,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":353},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Power & Energy Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/portal/index.jsp?pageID=pes_home"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=277693","abstract":"This paper proposes a new neural network diagnostic system for online power system fault section estimation using information of relays and circuit breakers. This system has a similar profile of an expert system, but can be constructed much more easily from elemental samples. These samples associate fault section with its primary, local and/or remote protective relays and breakers. The diagnostic system can be applicable to the power system control center for single or multiple fault sections estimation, even in the cases of failure operation of relays and breakers, or error-existent data transmission. The proposed approach has been practically verified by testing on a model power system. The test results, although preliminary, suggest this system can be implemented by various electric utilities with relatively low customization effort.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/61.277693","startPage":"220","endPage":"230","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","pdfPath":"/iel3/61/6861/00277693.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/61.277693","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6861","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new neural networks approach to on-line fault section estimation using information of protective relays and circuit breakers","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Power system relaying","Circuit faults","Protective relaying","Power system faults","Power system protection","System testing","Power system modeling","Circuit breakers","Diagnostic expert systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power systems","fault location","neural nets","relay protection","circuit breakers","power engineering computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural network","online power system fault section estimation","protective relays","circuit breakers","diagnostic system","testing","electric utilities"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/277693/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1994","displayDocTitle":"A new neural networks approach to on-line fault section estimation using information of protective relays and circuit breakers","volume":"9","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4671832","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new neural networks approach to on-line fault section estimation using information of protective relays and circuit breakers","sourcePdf":"00277693.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.040611S","chronDate":"Jan 1994","isNumber":"6861","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"61","citationCount":"73","articleId":"277693","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":277697,"authors":[{"name":"L.W.

In 1944, the hottest spot temperature allowance for ventilated dry type transformers was established as 30/spl deg/C for 80/spl deg/C average winding temperature rise. Since 1944, insulation temperature classes have increased to 220/spl deg/C but IEEE standards continue to use a constant 30/spl deg/C hottest spot temperature allowance. IEC standards use a variable hottest spot temperature allowance from 5 to 30/spl deg/C. Six full size test windings were manufactured with imbedded thermocouples and 133 test runs performed to obtain temperature rise data. The test data indicated that the hottest spot temperature allowance used in IEEE standards for ventilated dry type transformers above 500 kVA is too low. This is due to the large thermal gradient from the bottom to the top of the windings caused by natural convection air flow through the cooling ducts. A constant ratio of hottest spot winding temperature rise to average winding temperature rise should be used in product standards for all insulation temperature classes. A ratio of 1.5 is suggested for ventilated dry type transformers above 500 kVA. This would increase the hottest spot temperature allowance from 30/spl deg/C to 60/spl deg/C and decrease the permissible average winding temperature rise from 150/spl deg/C to 120/spl deg/C for the 220/spl deg/C insulation temperature class.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/61.277697","startPage":"257","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","pdfPath":"/iel3/61/6861/00277697.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/61.277697","endPage":"264","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6861","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hottest spot temperatures in ventilated dry type transformers","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/277697/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1994","displayDocTitle":"Hottest spot temperatures in ventilated dry type transformers","volume":"9","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4671836","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Jan. 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hottest spot temperatures in ventilated dry type transformers","sourcePdf":"00277697.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.032876S","chronDate":"Jan 1994","isNumber":"6861","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"61","citationCount":"19","articleId":"277697","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":277711,"authors":[{"name":"M.A. Ibrahim","affiliation":["New York Power Authority, White Plains, NY, USA"],"firstName":"M.A.","lastName":"Ibrahim","id":"37363384100"},{"name":"F.P.

Experiments in a high power laboratory were performed to obtain transient responses. Simulation of the CT response to the same transient events was set up using three different CT models. They were implemented based on the saturable transformer and nonlinear reactor models available in an EMTP.

First Internat. Forum on Appls. of Neural Nets to Power Systs., Seattle, p.205-9, 1991) has shown the viability of using artificial neural networks (ANNs) for the early detection and control of overloaded lines. This paper focuses on the development of an artificial neural network based scheme for intelligent load shedding. The load shedding scheme consists of localized detectors that consider parameters of the power system during an emergency. The research was developed using the IEEE 30 bus test system which incorporates a design of net import and export regions. The approach is implemented in the import area of the system. The purpose of the scheme is to detect overloaded lines and make intelligent decisions about where within the topology of the system the load should be dropped and how much load to shed. The proposed scheme is designed to avoid unintentional separation of the system by fast, proactive, and adaptive control.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/61.277714","startPage":"425","endPage":"433","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/61.277714","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6861","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","pdfPath":"/iel3/61/6861/00277714.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Using artificial neural networks for load shedding to alleviate overloaded lines","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/277714/","displayDocTitle":"Using artificial neural networks for load shedding to alleviate overloaded lines","volume":"9","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4671853","publicationDate":"Jan. 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1994","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Using artificial neural networks for load shedding to alleviate overloaded lines","sourcePdf":"00277714.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.130554S","chronDate":"Jan 1994","isNumber":"6861","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"61","citationCount":"39","articleId":"277714","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":277715,"authors":[{"name":"L.G.

It is shown that by appropriate choice of protocols, a fault-tolerant system can be built that operates in any arbitrary configuration. Since the network is based on fiber optics, it can be made fast enough for substation monitoring and control. In this application, a relatively small number of cables is required to implement a high reliability system. The network can also be used for distribution automation. In this application the network is required to reach all parts of the power system, and the fiber cable itself becomes a significant fraction of the cost of communications. However, since many applications can be supported at once, the cost per function can be reasonable.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","pdfPath":"/iel3/61/6861/00277723.pdf","startPage":"510","endPage":"518","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","doi":"10.1109/61.277723","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/61.277723","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6861","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=277723","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design considerations for a fiber optic communications network for power systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optical design","Optical fiber communication","Monitoring","Optical control","Power system control","Communication system control","Communication cables","Optical fiber cables","Power system reliability","Control systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power system control","power system measurement","optical links","protocols"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fiber optic communications network","power systems control","power systems monitoring","protocols","fault-tolerant system","substation monitoring","substation control","high reliability system","distribution automation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/277723/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1994","displayDocTitle":"Design considerations for a fiber optic communications network for power systems","volume":"9","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 1994","accessionNumber":"4671862","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design considerations for a fiber optic communications network for power systems","sourcePdf":"00277723.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.067845S","chronDate":"Jan 1994","isNumber":"6861","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"61","citationCount":"8","articleId":"277723","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":277727,"authors":[{"name":"J.A.

The detected surge current is converted to digital data through a fast O/E converter and a fast A/D converter, and the distance to the point of fault is determined from the time difference of arrival of surge currents to both ends.

We examine the effect on throughput of (a) buffer size, (b) degree of reorganization, (c) write probability of transactions, (d) multiprogramming level, and (e) degree of clustered transactions. The problem of file reorganization that we consider involves altering the placement of records on pages of a secondary storage device. In addition, we want this reorganization to be done in place, i.e. using the file's original storage space for the newly reorganized file. Our approach is appropriate for a non-in-place reorganization as well. The motivation for such a physical change, i.e. record clustering, is to improve the database system's performance, i.e. minimizing the number of page accesses made in answering a set of queries. There are numerous record clustering algorithms, but they usually do not solve the entire problem, i.e., they do not specify how to efficiently reorganize the file to reflect the clustering assignment that they determine. In previous work, we have presented an algorithm that is a companion to general record clustering algorithms, i.e. it actually transforms the file. In this work we show through simulation that our algorithm, when run concurrently with user transactions, provides an acceptable level of overall database system performance.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6863","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel3/69/6863/00277769.pdf","doi":"10.1109/69.277769","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/69.277769","startPage":"248","endPage":"257","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance analysis of a concurrent file reorganization algorithm for record clustering","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/277769/","displayDocTitle":"Performance analysis of a concurrent file reorganization algorithm for record clustering","isJournal":true,"volume":"6","issue":"2","accessionNumber":"4680543","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"April 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance analysis of a concurrent file reorganization algorithm for record clustering","sourcePdf":"00277769.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.102675S","chronDate":"Apr 1994","isNumber":"6863","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"69","citationCount":"3","articleId":"277769","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":277783,"authors":[{"name":"S.

Since this problem is known to be NP-hard in the strong sense in all but a few very restricted eases, heuristic algorithms are being developed which obtain near optimal schedules in a reasonable amount of computation time. We present an efficient heuristic algorithm for scheduling precedence constrained task graphs with nonnegligible intertask communication onto multiprocessors taking contention in the communication channels into consideration. Our algorithm for obtaining satisfactory suboptimal schedules is based on the classical list scheduling strategy. It simultaneously exploits the schedule-holes generated in the processors and in the communication channels during the scheduling process in order to produce better schedules. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm by comparing with two competing heuristic algorithms available in the literature.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/277783/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1994","publicationDate":"March 1994","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4662369","volume":"5","issue":"3","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Scheduling precedence constrained task graphs with non-negligible intertask communication onto multiprocessors","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Scheduling precedence constrained task graphs with non-negligible intertask communication onto multiprocessors","sourcePdf":"00277783.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037256S","chronDate":"Mar 1994","isNumber":"6864","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"71","citationCount":"37","articleId":"277783","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":277787,"authors":[{"name":"Qian Ping Gu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada","Department of Computer Software, University of Aizu, Fukushima, Japan"],"lastName":"Qian Ping Gu","id":"37087144742"},{"name":"Jun Gu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada"],"lastName":"Jun Gu","id":"37087375426"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1045-9219"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2183"},{"format":"CD","value":"2161-9883"}],"articleNumber":"277787","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":48},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sorting","Concurrent computing","Computational modeling","Parallel algorithms","Very large scale integration","Indexing","History","Upper bound","Software","Cities and towns"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sorting","communication complexity","computational complexity","parallel algorithms","multiprocessor interconnection networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["average time bounds","sorting","mesh-connected computer","parallel sorting algorithms","wraparound connections","queue size","distance bound","indexing schemes","average time complexity","parallel algorithms"]}],"abstract":"We give three new parallel sorting algorithms on a mesh-connected computer with wraparound connections (i.e. a torus).

The HMM tracker as originally formulated uses a gate of spectral bins from fast Fourier transform (FFT) processing, and associates each cell with a state of the hidden Markov chain. A measurement sequence based on the output of a simple threshold detector forms the input to the HMM tracker. Two extensions to the original tracker are proposed. The first, the HMM/A tracker, incorporates the FFT amplitudes in the cells of the measurement sequence. The second, the HMM/AP tracker, does not use a measurement sequence, but uses instead the FFT amplitude and phase values in all cells within the gate. A comparison of the results obtained in using the three HMM-based trackers with simulated data reveals that the extended trackers outperform the original. An analysis of the effect of parameter mismatch for the three trackers is presented. Their use as detectors is also discussed.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/78/6865/00277803.pdf","startPage":"2965","endPage":"2976","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/78.277803","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.277803","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6865","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=277803","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Frequency tracking using hidden Markov models with amplitude and phase information","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hidden Markov models","Signal processing algorithms","Detectors","Frequency estimation","Random variables","Phase measurement","Background noise","Frequency conversion","Speech processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fast Fourier transforms","hidden Markov models","signal detection","signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frequency tracking","amplitude information","FFT phase","hidden Markov models","phase information","gate of spectral bins","fast Fourier transform","threshold detector","HMM tracker","HMM/A tracker","HMM/AP tracker","FFT amplitude","parameter mismatch"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/277803/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1993","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1993","displayDocTitle":"Frequency tracking using hidden Markov models with amplitude and phase information","volume":"41","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 1993","accessionNumber":"4557209","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Frequency tracking using hidden Markov models with amplitude and phase information","sourcePdf":"00277803.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.048146S","chronDate":"Oct 1993","isNumber":"6865","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"28","articleId":"277803","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":277805,"authors":[{"name":"G.

Given a band-limited input X producing a quantized version C, the authors consider the set of all input signals that are band-limited and produce C. They call any element of this set a consistent estimate of X. Regardless of the type of encoder (simple, predictive, or noise-shaping), they show that this set is convex, and as a consequence, any nonconsistent estimate can be improved. They also show that the classical linear decoding estimates are not necessarily consistent. Numerical tests performed on simple ADC, single-loop, and multiloop /spl Sigma//spl Delta/ modulation show that consistent estimates yield a mean square error (MSE) that decreases asymptotically with the oversampling ratio faster than the linear decoding MSE by approximately 3 dB/octave. This implies an asymptotic MSE of the order of /spl Oscr/(R/sup /spl minus/(2n+2/)) instead of /spl Oscr/(R/sup /spl minus/(2n+1/)) in linear decoding, where R is the oversampling ratio and n the order of the modulator.

First, the concept of the generalized sliding fast Fourier transform (GSFFT) as an efficient implementation of the hopping FFT is introduced. Application of the GSFFT is broad and not limited to what has been considered in this paper. The frequency domain block LMS (FBLMS) adaptive filters are then revised, and their implementations for block lengths less than the length of the adaptive filter are studied. The GSFFT and the available pruned FFTs are used to give an efficient implementation of these filters.

In practice, the solution is defined as one minimum point of a suitable functional, the main part of which accounts for the underlying physical model, whereas the regularizing part represents some prior information about the unknowns. In the Bayesian interpretation, one has a maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimator in which the main and regularizing parts are represented, respectively, by likelihood and prior distributions. When either the prior or likelihood is a Laplace distribution and the other is a Gaussian distribution, one is led to consider functionals that include both absolute and square norms.

The basic step in this method is the computation of eigenvector corresponding to the minimum eigenvalue of the autocorrelation matrix of the underlying data. The authors recast a known constrained minimization formulation for obtaining this eigenvector into the neural network (NN) framework. Using the penalty function approach, they develop an appropriate energy function for the NN. This NN is of feedback type with the neurons having sigmoidal activation function. Analysis of the proposed approach shows that the required eigenvector is a minimizer (with a given norm) of this energy function. Further, all its minimizers are global minimizers. Bounds on the integration time step that is required to numerically solve the system of nonlinear differential equations, which define the network dynamics, have been derived.

Although this approach performs well, it has a number of disadvantages. In particular, exact MAP estimates cannot be computed, approximate MAP estimates are computationally expensive to compute, and unsupervised parameter estimation of the MRF is difficult. The authors propose a new approach to Bayesian image segmentation that directly addresses these problems. The new method replaces the MRF model with a novel multiscale random field (MSRF) and replaces the MAP estimator with a sequential MAP (SMAP) estimator derived from a novel estimation criteria. Together, the proposed estimator and model result in a segmentation algorithm that is not iterative and can be computed in time proportional to MN where M is the number of classes and N is the number of pixels. The also develop a computationally efficient method for unsupervised estimation of model parameters. Simulations on synthetic images indicate that the new algorithm performs better and requires much less computation than MAP estimation using simulated annealing. The algorithm is also found to improve classification accuracy when applied to the segmentation of multispectral remotely sensed images with ground truth data.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/83.277898","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/83/6868/00277898.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/83.277898","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6868","startPage":"162","endPage":"177","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A multiscale random field model for Bayesian image segmentation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=277898","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A multiscale random field model for Bayesian image segmentation","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/277898/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1994","isJournal":true,"volume":"3","issue":"2","publicationDate":"March 1994","accessionNumber":"4680773","pubMedId":"18291917","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A multiscale random field model for Bayesian image segmentation","sourcePdf":"00277898.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.049229S","chronDate":"March  1994","isNumber":"6868","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"414","articleId":"277898","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":277900,"authors":[{"name":"R.C.

The RCRS filters are developed within the general framework of rank selection (RS) filters, which are filters constrained to output an order statistic from the observation set. Many previously proposed rank order based filters can be formulated as RS filters. The only difference between such filters is in the information used in deciding which order statistic to output. The information used by RCRS filters is the ranks of selected input samples, hence the name rank conditioned rank selection filters. The number of input sample ranks used is referred to as the order of the RCRS filter. The order can range from zero to the number of samples in the observation window, giving the filters valuable flexibility. Low-order filters can give good performance and are relatively simple to optimize and implement. If improved performance is demanded, the order can be increased but at the expense of filter simplicity. In this paper, many statistical and deterministic properties of the RCRS filters are presented. A procedure for optimizing over the class of RCRS filters is also presented. Finally, extensive computer simulation results that illustrate the performance of RCRS filters in comparison with other techniques in image restoration applications are presented.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/83.277900","startPage":"192","endPage":"206","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/83/6868/00277900.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/83.277900","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6868","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Rank conditioned rank selection filters for signal restoration","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Signal restoration","Nonlinear filters","Information filtering","Information filters","Statistics","Computer simulation","Image restoration","Application software","Laboratories","Image processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital filters","filtering and prediction theory","image reconstruction","statistical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["rank conditioned rank selection filters","signal restoration","nonlinear filters","RCRS filters","order statistic","input samples","observation window","low-order filters","deterministic properties","statistical properties","computer simulation","image restoration"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/277900/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1994","displayDocTitle":"Rank conditioned rank selection filters for signal restoration","volume":"3","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4680775","pubMedId":"18291919","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Rank conditioned rank selection filters for signal restoration","sourcePdf":"00277900.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033481S","chronDate":"March  1994","isNumber":"6868","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"130","articleId":"277900","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":277901,"authors":[{"name":"E.

The internal structure of the processor is organized as a cascade of pipeline stages which perform parallel execution of the processes into which each inference can be decomposed. A particular feature of the project is the definition of a 'fuzzy-gate', which executes elementary fuzzy computations, on which construction of the whole core of the processor is based.

Some relationships between several existing and the new measures are established, and some new properties are derived. The relative merits and drawbacks of different measures for applications are discussed. A weighted fuzzy entropy which is flexible enough to incorporate subjectiveness in the measure of fuzziness is also introduced.

We consider two design problems: nonrobust controller design and robust controller design. The former is a design problem for fuzzy systems with no premise parameter uncertainty. The latter is a design problem for fuzzy systems with premise parameter uncertainty. To realize two design problems, we derive four stability conditions from a basic stability condition proposed by Tanaka and Sugeno: nonrobust condition, weak nonrobust condition, robust condition, and weak robust condition. We introduce concept of robust stability for fuzzy control systems with premise parameter uncertainty from the weak robust condition. To introduce robust stability, admissible region and variation region, which correspond to stability margin in the ordinary control theory, are defined. Furthermore, we develop a control system for backing up a computer simulated truck-trailer which is nonlinear and unstable. By approximating the truck-trailer by a fuzzy system with premise parameter uncertainty and by using concept of robust stability, we design a fuzzy controller which guarantees stability of the control system under a condition. The simulation results show that the designed fuzzy controller smoothly achieves backing up control of the truck-trailer from all initial positions.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/91.277961","startPage":"119","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","pdfPath":"/iel4/91/6869/00277961.pdf","endPage":"134","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6869","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/91.277961","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/277961/","displayDocTitle":"A robust stabilization problem of fuzzy control systems and its application to backing up control of a truck-trailer","volume":"2","issue":"2","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4686391","publicationDate":"May 1994","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A robust stabilization problem of fuzzy control systems and its application to backing up control of a truck-trailer","sourcePdf":"00277961.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039635S","chronDate":"May 1994","isNumber":"6869","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"91","citationCount":"566","articleId":"277961","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":277962,"authors":[{"name":"A.J.

In this connection, algorithms characterizing different situations have been described, including the case where the KB is characterized by complete information about all the input variables and the case where it is characterized by ignorance of some of these variables. For this last situation we develop a process of \"incremental reasoning\"; this process allows the KB to take information about previously unknown values into consideration as soon as such information becomes available. Furthermore, as compared to other solutions, the rule chaining mechanism we introduce is more flexible, and the description of the rules more generic. The computational complexity of these algorithms is O((C/2+M+N)R/sup 2/) for the \"complete information\" case and O((M+N)R/sup 2/) and O(2(M+N)R/sup 2/) for the other cases, where R is the number of fuzzy conditional statements of the KB, M and N the maximum number of antecedents and consequents in the rules and C the number of chaining transitions in the KB representation.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","pdfPath":"/iel4/91/6869/00277962.pdf","startPage":"135","endPage":"150","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","doi":"10.1109/91.277962","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/91.277962","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6869","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=277962","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fuzzy reasoning supported by Petri nets","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fuzzy reasoning","Petri nets","Fuzzy control","Fuzzy systems","Fuzzy logic","Production systems","Process control","Algorithm design and analysis","Input variables","Control system synthesis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fuzzy logic","Petri nets","knowledge based systems","computational complexity"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fuzzy reasoning","Petri nets","representational model","fuzzy production systems","rule chaining","data driven strategy","sup-min compositional rule","inference","incremental reasoning","computational complexity"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/277962/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1994","displayDocTitle":"Fuzzy reasoning supported by Petri nets","volume":"2","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 1994","accessionNumber":"4686392","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fuzzy reasoning supported by Petri nets","sourcePdf":"00277962.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043592S","chronDate":"May 1994","isNumber":"6869","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"91","citationCount":"123","articleId":"277962","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":277964,"authors":[{"name":"Xiao-Jun Zeng","affiliation":["Decision Technologies Group, Department of Computation,  Institute of Science & Technology, University of Manchester, Institute of Science and Technology, Manchester, UK"],"lastName":"Xiao-Jun Zeng","id":"37272246300"},{"name":"M.G.

These properties provide a clear picture of the shape and features of FBF's. Based on these properties of FBF's, we obtain some basic approximation properties of fuzzy systems: basic approximation property, uniform approximation property, uniform convergent property and universal approximation property.

Because high-order noise shaping greatly reduces the quantization noise in the signal band, the dynamic range of these modulators tends to be bounded by the thermal noise of the input stage and the maximum voltage swing in the signal path. This paper introduces a third-order cascaded sigma-delta modulator that uses a modified cascaded architecture and reduced gain in the first integrator to increase the dynamic range. An experimental modulator fabricated in a 1-/spl mu/m CMOS technology attains a resolution of 17 b for a 25-kHz signal bandwidth while operating from a single 5-V supply. With an oversampling ratio of 128 and a clock frequency of 6.4 MHz, the modulator achieves a 104-dB dynamic range and a peak signal-to-noise+distortion ratio (SNDR) of 98 dB. As indicated by both measurements and simulations, the cascaded architecture also greatly reduces the discrete noise peaks that can be present in a single-stage architecture.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/278340/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"29","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4684147","displayDocTitle":"A third-order sigma-delta modulator with extended dynamic range","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A third-order sigma-delta modulator with extended dynamic range","sourcePdf":"00278340.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.059044S","chronDate":"Mar 1994","isNumber":"6908","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"75","articleId":"278340","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":278341,"authors":[{"name":"R.H.

AWEswit is a mixed signal simulator for switched capacitor circuits. It allows for portions of the circuit to be modeled with digital blocks controlled by an event queue. The remainder of the circuit is modeled in the analog domain. The paper describes the circuit formulations employed by AWEswit, and how they are exploited in modeling the nonidealities associated with switched capacitor circuits. AWEswit employs asymptotic waveform evaluation (AWE) as its core simulation engine. It combines circuit formulations in the charge-voltage and current-voltage regimes. This flexibility in the circuit formulations means that if the circuit is modeled entirely with ideal switches (i.e. no resistors), then it is automatically solved in the charge-voltage regime (like SWITCAP2). However, if portions of the circuit need to be solved in the current-voltage regime, then AWEswit automatically partitions the circuit and solves the different partitions in whichever regime is appropriate, i.e., in the current-voltage regime (using AWE to evaluate circuit response) or in the charge-voltage regime. AWEswit naturally handles the bandwidth limitations associated with switched capacitor circuits. In addition, it models the clock feedthrough and signal-dependent charge dump that characterize MOSFET switches. The simulator is illustrated by example.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/278343/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1994","volume":"29","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4684150","publicationDate":"March 1994","displayDocTitle":"A switched capacitor circuit simulator: AWEswit","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A switched capacitor circuit simulator: AWEswit","sourcePdf":"00278343.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.048705S","chronDate":"Mar 1994","isNumber":"6908","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"20","articleId":"278343","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2022-01-15"},{"_id":278344,"authors":[{"name":"B.R.

By spatially discretizing a simplified form of Maxwell's equations, a three-dimensional linear mesh model of the substrate is developed. For simulation, a macromodel of the fine substrate mesh is formulated and a modified version of SPICE3 is used to simulate the electrical circuit coupled with the macromodel. For synthesis, a coarse substrate mesh, and interconnect models are used to couple linear macromodels of circuit functional blocks. Asymptotic Waveform Evaluation (AWE) is used to evaluate the electrical behavior of the network at every iteration in the synthesis process. Macromodel simulations are significantly faster than device level simulations and compare accurately to measured results. Synthesis results demonstrate the critical need to constrain substrate noise and simultaneously optimize power bus geometry and pad assignment to meet performance targets.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/4.278344","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel1/4/6908/00278344.pdf","startPage":"226","endPage":"238","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/4.278344","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6908","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Addressing substrate coupling in mixed-mode ICs: simulation and power distribution synthesis","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=278344","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/278344/","displayDocTitle":"Addressing substrate coupling in mixed-mode ICs: simulation and power distribution synthesis","volume":"29","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 1994","accessionNumber":"4684151","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Addressing substrate coupling in mixed-mode ICs: simulation and power distribution synthesis","sourcePdf":"00278344.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044652S","chronDate":"Mar 1994","isNumber":"6908","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"182","articleId":"278344","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":278345,"authors":[{"name":"T.L.

This problem is important in high-accuracy analog circuits where it can cause errors at the 12 b level and above. In this paper, transient threshold voltage shifts are characterized with respect to their dependence on stress amplitude and duration, relaxation time, gate bias, substrate bias, drain voltage, temperature, and channel width and length. In contrast to previous studies, threshold voltage shifts are measured at time and voltage scales relevant to analog circuits, and are shown to occur even when the effects of Fowler-Nordheim tunneling, avalanche injection, hot carriers, trap generation, self-heating, mobile ions, and dipolar polarizations are absent. A new model is proposed in which channel charge carriers tunnel to and from near-interface oxide traps by one of three parallel pathways. Transitions may occur elastically, by direct tunneling between the silicon band edges and an oxide trap, or inelastically, by tunneling in conjunction with a thermal transition in the insulator or at the Si-SiO/sub 2/ interface. Simulations based on this model show excellent agreement with experimental results. The threshold voltage shifts are also shown to be correlated with 1/f noise, in corroboration of the tunneling model.

How to use Binary Decision Diagrams to compare the voting model to other fault models is also presented. Finally, delay tests are shown to be a poor means for detecting bridging faults.

The applications are processed using a 1.5 /spl mu/m, n-well, double-polysilicon, double-layer metal CMOS process. Applications include frequency synthesis for computer clock generation, disk drives, and pixel clock generators for computer monitors, with maximum frequencies up to 80 MHz. The synthesizers require no external components since the loop filter and oscillator are on chip with the phase frequency detector and the charge pump. Special voltage and current reference cells are discussed. Analysis of noise sources in the PLL demonstrates the need for reducing the phase noise of the system. A low phase noise is achieved through supply rejection techniques and by placing the oscillator in a high-gain feedback loop to minimize its noise contributions. Laboratory measurements of completed silicon show synthesizers with exceptionally linear gain, as well as transient responses and phase noise similar to predicted results.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/4.278348","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel1/4/6908/00278348.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/4.278348","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6908","startPage":"271","endPage":"279","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cell-based fully integrated CMOS frequency synthesizers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=278348","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Cell-based fully integrated CMOS frequency synthesizers","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/278348/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1994","isJournal":true,"volume":"29","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 1994","accessionNumber":"4684155","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cell-based fully integrated CMOS frequency synthesizers","sourcePdf":"00278348.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039205S","chronDate":"Mar 1994","isNumber":"6908","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"76","articleId":"278348","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":278352,"authors":[{"name":"R.

Security considerations led to novel system concepts in chip design including protection of sensitive information and on-line failure detection capabilities. BIST was instrumental for reconciling contradicting requirements of VLSI testability and cryptographic security. The VLSI chip implements data encryption and decryption in a single hardware unit. All important standardized modes of operation of block ciphers, such as ECB, CBC, CFB, OFB, and MAC, are supported. In addition, new modes are proposed and implemented to fully exploit the algorithm's inherent parallelism. With a system clock frequency of 25 MHz the device permits a data conversion rate of more than 177 Mb/s. Therefore, the chip can be applied to on-line encryption in high-speed networking protocols like ATM or FDDI.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/4.278352","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6908","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/4.278352","endPage":"307","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel1/4/6908/00278352.pdf","startPage":"303","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 177 Mb/s VLSI implementation of the International Data Encryption Algorithm","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/278352/","displayDocTitle":"A 177 Mb/s VLSI implementation of the International Data Encryption Algorithm","volume":"29","issue":"3","accessionNumber":"4684159","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"March 1994","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 177 Mb/s VLSI implementation of the International Data Encryption Algorithm","sourcePdf":"00278352.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.058295S","chronDate":"Mar 1994","isNumber":"6908","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"78","articleId":"278352","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":278353,"authors":[{"name":"K.

Its driver characteristics can easily be switched between fast and slow modes in the assembly process. With a small inductance load, the driver operates 2.5 ns faster in fast mode than in slow mode. In slow mode, this driver reduces the initial drive current and prevents ringing waveforms even with a large inductance load. For example, with a 5-pF capacitance load and a 20-cm wire, the ringing amplitude in slow mode is reduced to 1/3 of fast mode. Users can select the output driver operating mode that best suits their application. The self-recovering Vpp generators feed 16 output drivers and control the generator capacity according to the data pattern to supply the exact amount of Vpp charge consumed by the output drivers. The Vpp generator saves 3.9 mA on average in 25-ns read cycle.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An adjustable output driver with a self-recovering Vpp generator for a 4M/spl times/16 DRAM","doi":"10.1109/4.278353","startPage":"308","endPage":"310","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/4.278353","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6908","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel1/4/6908/00278353.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=278353","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/278353/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1994","displayDocTitle":"An adjustable output driver with a self-recovering Vpp generator for a 4M/spl times/16 DRAM","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"29","issue":"3","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 1994","accessionNumber":"4684160","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An adjustable output driver with a self-recovering Vpp generator for a 4M/spl times/16 DRAM","sourcePdf":"00278353.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.028876S","chronDate":"Mar 1994","isNumber":"6908","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"11","articleId":"278353","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":278354,"authors":[{"name":"K.

Employing the new definition, the new approach to the design of a current mode fuzzy microchip controller was performed. The controller was constructed with CMOS current mirrors. The circuit allowed two premises, one conclusion, and nine rules; the latter were programmable with current sources. The chip consumed 2 mA at a 5 V power supply for a core area of 0.4 mm/sup 2/. Furthermore, the performance of the developed fuzzy architecture reached 10 M FLIPS (fuzzy inferences per second) for the standard 1.2 /spl mu/m CMOS technology.

It is also important for future high-density VLSI realizations that are vulnerable to soft-errors. However, the direct checking of floating-point arithmetic is still an open problem. The author presents a set of reliable floating-point arithmetic algorithms for low-cost residue encoded and Berger encoded operands, respectively. Closed form equations are derived for floating-point addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Given the standard IEEE floating-point numbers, the proposed reliable floating-point multiplication algorithms for low-cost residue encoded operands are extremely low-cost: it requires less than 8% of hardware redundancy in all cases. For reliable floating-point addition and subtraction, the author finds the hardware redundancy ratios of applying low-cost residue code is about the same as that of applying Berger code: less than 40% of hardware redundancy for single precision numbers and about 16% for double precision numbers. For reliable floating-point division, Berger encoded operands yields hardware cost-effectiveness: about 45% for single precision numbers and about 36% for double precision numbers.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","startPage":"400","endPage":"412","doi":"10.1109/12.278479","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/12.278479","pdfPath":"/iel1/12/6911/00278479.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6911","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reliable floating-point arithmetic algorithms for error-coded operands","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/278479/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1994","displayDocTitle":"Reliable floating-point arithmetic algorithms for error-coded operands","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"April 1994","accessionNumber":"4679472","volume":"43","issue":"4","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reliable floating-point arithmetic algorithms for error-coded operands","sourcePdf":"00278479.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.053564S","chronDate":"Apr 1994","isNumber":"6911","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"16","articleId":"278479","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":278482,"authors":[{"name":"M.J.

Cosmic-ray-induced soft errors in electronic components have long been a problem for the designers of satellites and spacecraft, but they have not generally been considered to be an important influence on memory chip soft error rate (SER) in terrestrial environments. In an experiment designed to determine the effect of cosmic radiation on the SER of a sample of DRAM chips at ground level, the SER of a large number of chips was measured at various locations and altitudes around the US: near sea level in Essex Junction, VT; 200 m underground in a Kansas salt mine; at an altitude of 1.6 km in Boulder, CO; and at 3.1 km in Leadville, CO.

The model presented requires only a few material parameters as input. To calculate ferrite hysteresis losses, a model based on empirical rules is employed. For high-frequency eddy current losses, a built phenomenon is assumed. It is demonstrated that the hysteresis model reproduces all of the important known features of the soft ferrites. These features include hysteresis loop shapes for low- and high-field excitations, the nonlinear permeability behavior, and hysteresis loss dependence on the amplitude of the exciting field. It is found that the total calculated core loss as a function of frequency and flux density correctly describes the observed soft ferrite behavior. The theoretical results are compared with available data for two commercial ferrites, and good agreement is found up to fairly high frequencies ( approximately 500 kHz).<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/20.278656","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6914","startPage":"4407","endPage":"4415","pdfPath":"/iel1/20/6914/00278656.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/20.278656","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Ferrite core loss for power magnetic components design","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Ferrites","Core loss","Magnetic hysteresis","Magnetic flux","Frequency","Voltage","Magnetic materials","Soft magnetic materials","Eddy currents","Shape"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["eddy current losses","ferrite devices","magnetic cores","magnetic hysteresis","magnetic leakage"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power magnetic components design","ferrite core losses","arbitrary voltage waveforms","model","hysteresis losses","high-frequency eddy current losses","soft ferrites","hysteresis loop shapes","nonlinear permeability","1 to 500 kHz"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1991","displayDocTitle":"Ferrite core loss for power magnetic components design","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/278656/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1991","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","volume":"27","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4123358","publicationDate":"Nov. 1991","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ferrite core loss for power magnetic components design","sourcePdf":"00278656.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033848S","chronDate":"Nov.  1991","isNumber":"6914","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"94","articleId":"278656","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-19"},{"_id":278657,"authors":[{"name":"R.

By removing the conducting parts drastic reduction of the domain to be modelled can be achieved. In the present approach very sparse linear algebraic systems are created and then solved. The asymptotic case, called the infinitely high frequency condition, which expresses field non-penetration in the conductor parts of the domain being studied, is discussed. Reliability of the infinitely high frequency condition is discussed. In a first application, the computation of the tangential component of the magnetic field is presented.

Measurements of delta (H) were made for a range of CoPtCr films with differing numbers of layers, but with a constant overall total magnetic layer thickness. The results indicate that the multilayer films show two types of switching behavior due to the difference in the Cr underlayer and interlayer thicknesses. It is concluded that interactions within the film are reduced when the magnetic single layer is laminated with chromium. Thus the recording performance is expected to be improved as the number of the layers increases, due to the reduction in intergranular coupling between and possibly within the layers.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/20.278740","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7856893","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel1/20/7856893/00278740.pdf","endPage":"5063","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Interaction effects in multi-layer thin film media","doi":"10.1109/20.278740","startPage":"5061","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=278740","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1991","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1991","displayDocTitle":"Interaction effects in multi-layer thin film media","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/278740/","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4123423","publicationDate":"Nov. 1991","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"27","issue":"6","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Interaction effects in multi-layer thin film media","sourcePdf":"00278740.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036597S","chronDate":"Nov.  1991","isNumber":"7856893","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"25","articleId":"278740","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":278782,"authors":[{"name":"G.A.

That is, they are artificial and have no physical basis. These discontinuities, however accurate the mesh might be, persist. As such, the solution of inverse problems gets to be slow. The authors present three approaches to minimizing this error: adaptive meshes, edge elements, and crunched meshes. The latter is shown to be significantly faster for optimization, although the field solutions in the iterations have accuracy depending on the fineness of the initial mesh. Adaptive approaches on the other hand significantly slow down convergence. Edge elements improve flux-density-based object functions by making them C/sup 1/ continuous because no derivative of the potential is required, although multiple minima continue to exist; but the C/sup 1/ continuity makes it possible to utilize faster algorithms using the Hessian.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel1/20/7856893/00278791.pdf","startPage":"5214","endPage":"5216","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","doi":"10.1109/20.278791","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/20.278791","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7856893","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=278791","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fictitious minima of object functions, finite element meshes, and edge elements in electromagnetic device synthesis","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Finite element methods","Electromagnetic devices","Inverse problems","Bismuth","Educational institutions","Electromagnetic fields","Electromagnetic analysis","Art","Performance analysis","Cost function"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electrical engineering computing","electromagnetic devices","finite element analysis","inverse problems","optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["inverse problem","fictitious minima","object functions","finite element meshes","edge elements","electromagnetic device synthesis","discontinuities","mesh error","adaptive meshes","crunched meshes","optimization"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/278791/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1991","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1991","displayDocTitle":"Fictitious minima of object functions, finite element meshes, and edge elements in electromagnetic device synthesis","volume":"27","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 1991","accessionNumber":"4133952","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fictitious minima of object functions, finite element meshes, and edge elements in electromagnetic device synthesis","sourcePdf":"00278791.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.031316S","chronDate":"Nov.  1991","isNumber":"7856893","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"35","articleId":"278791","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":278797,"authors":[{"name":"E.

Results show a large increase in the width of a transition due to the demagnetizing field effect of earlier transitions. Based on this observation, a simple recording channel model is developed to investigate the effects of nonlinear transition broadening on detection performance. This analysis shows that the conventional peak detector is much less sensitive to the detrimental effects of nonlinearity than the more advanced partial response maximum likelihood (PRML) scheme, mainly due to the extra transition spacing provided by the minimum run-length-limited constraint. This result suggests that in order to preserve the improved signal detection capability of advanced signal processing schemes like PRML, reduction of nonlinearity is essential in the media design.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/20.278961","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel1/20/7856893/00278961.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/20.278961","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7856893","startPage":"4831","endPage":"4833","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00278961.png","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Nonlinear effects of transition broadening","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=278961","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Nonlinear effects of transition broadening","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/278961/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1991","isJournal":true,"volume":"27","issue":"6","publicationDate":"Nov. 1991","accessionNumber":"4139097","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Nonlinear effects of transition broadening","sourcePdf":"00278961.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073231S","chronDate":"Nov.  1991","isNumber":"7856893","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"20","articleId":"278961","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":278962,"authors":[{"name":"M.P.

Channel variations considered are due to the head-medium velocity variations and head-medium spacing fluctuations, reflected in the height and width changes in the read pulse. Given equalizers/detectors are first tuned to a specific value of PW50, the half-height width of the read pulse. The signal-to-noise ratio degradation was observed as the actual PW50 is varied around this nominal value. The results show that the sensitivity varies widely across different detectors. For example, the partial response maximum likelihood (PRML) schemes, which achieve large performance advantages over peak detection under ideal conditions, are highly sensitive to channel variations and perform worse than peak detection as the PW50 mismatch becomes large. On the other hand, the recently introduced fixed-delay tree search with decision feedback (FDTS/DF) exhibits good resistance to channel variations while achieving favorable nominal performance.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/278963/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1991","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1991","volume":"27","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 1991","accessionNumber":"4139099","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","displayDocTitle":"Signal-to-noise ratio degradation with channel mismatch (in magnetic recording)","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Signal-to-noise ratio degradation with channel mismatch (in magnetic recording)","sourcePdf":"00278963.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.057571S","chronDate":"Nov.  1991","isNumber":"7856893","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"3","articleId":"278963","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":278980,"authors":[{"name":"K.

The ET-RIE method is very promising for patterning Fe-based alloy as thin-film head pole material.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/20.278980","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7856893","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/20.278980","endPage":"4890","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel1/20/7856893/00278980.pdf","startPage":"4888","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reactive ion etching of Fe-Si-Al alloy for thin film head","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1991","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/278980/","displayDocTitle":"Reactive ion etching of Fe-Si-Al alloy for thin film head","volume":"27","issue":"6","accessionNumber":"4139116","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Nov. 1991","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reactive ion etching of Fe-Si-Al alloy for thin film head","sourcePdf":"00278980.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.028867S","chronDate":"Nov.  1991","isNumber":"7856893","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"37","articleId":"278980","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":278989,"authors":[{"name":"S.

Unlike conventional neural net models, this algorithm incorporates fuzzy set-theoretic concepts at various stages. The input vector consists of membership values for linguistic properties along with some contextual class membership information which is used during self-organization to permit efficient modeling of fuzzy (ambiguous) patterns. A new definition of gain factor for weight updating is proposed. An index of disorder involving mean square distance between the input and weight vectors is used to determine a measure of the ordering of the output space. This controls the number of sweeps required in the process. Incorporation of the concept of fuzzy partitioning allows natural self-organization of the input data, especially when they have ill-defined boundaries. The output of unknown test patterns is generated in terms of class membership values. Incorporation of fuzziness in input and output is seen to provide better performance as compared to the original Kohonen model and the hard version. The effectiveness of this algorithm is demonstrated on the speech recognition problem for various network array sizes, training sets and gain factors.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/21.278989","startPage":"385","endPage":"399","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel1/21/6915/00278989.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/21.278989","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6915","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Self-organizing neural network as a fuzzy classifier","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Fuzzy neural networks","Fuzzy sets","Testing","Neurons","Artificial neural networks","Neurofeedback","Humans","Test pattern generators","Speech recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["self-organising feature maps","speech recognition","fuzzy set theory","pattern recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fuzzy classifier","self-organizing artificial neural network","Kohonen's model","fuzzy input","fuzzy set-theoretic concepts","membership values","linguistic properties","contextual class membership information","fuzzy patterns","gain factor","weight updating","fuzzy partitioning","speech recognition","training sets"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/278989/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1994","displayDocTitle":"Self-organizing neural network as a fuzzy classifier","volume":"24","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4679708","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Self-organizing neural network as a fuzzy classifier","sourcePdf":"00278989.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.042753S","chronDate":"Mar 1994","isNumber":"6915","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"21","citationCount":"94","articleId":"278989","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":278990,"authors":[{"name":"G.A.

The application of this technique usually results in a least squares approximation or a spline fitting of the parameter of interest. This is often adequate for estimating smooth parameter fields. However, when the parameter of interest has discontinuities the estimate formed by this technique will smooth over the discontinuities. Several techniques have been introduced to modify the regularization process to incorporate discontinuities. Many of these approaches however, will themselves be ill-posed or ill-conditioned. This paper presents a technique for incorporating discontinuities into the reconstruction problem while maintaining a well-posed and well-conditioned problem statement. The resulting computational problem is a convex functional minimization problem. This method is compared to previous approaches and examples are presented for the problems of reconstructing curves and surfaces with discontinuities and for estimating image data. Computational issues arising in both analog and digital implementations are also discussed.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/21.278994","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","startPage":"455","endPage":"469","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/21.278994","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6915","pdfPath":"/iel1/21/6915/00278994.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Parameter estimation","Surface reconstruction","Image reconstruction","Computer vision","Motion estimation","Laboratories","Stability","Senior members","Inverse problems","Least squares approximation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["inverse problems","functional analysis","image reconstruction","computer vision","parameter estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discontinuity preserving regularization","inverse visual problems","Tikhonov regularization","well-posed inverse problems","low-level vision","discontinuities","reconstruction","well-posed well-conditioned problem","convex functional minimization problem","digital implementations","analog implementations"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Discontinuity preserving regularization of inverse visual problems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/278994/","volume":"24","issue":"3","accessionNumber":"4684330","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"March 1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1994","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Discontinuity preserving regularization of inverse visual problems","sourcePdf":"00278994.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.053539S","chronDate":"Mar 1994","isNumber":"6915","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"21","citationCount":"62","articleId":"278994","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":278999,"authors":[{"name":"B.V.

The approach, based on the concept of an optimal subset selection from a given training data set, derives a consistent subset which is aimed to be minimal in size. This minimal consistent subset (MCS) selection, in contrast to most of the other previous attempts of this nature, leads to an unique solution irrespective of the initial order of presentation of the data. Further, consistency property is assured at every iteration. Also, unlike under most prior approaches, the samples are selected here in the order of significance of their contribution for enabling the consistency property. This provides insight into the relative significance of the samples in the training set. Experimental results based on a number of independent training and test data sets are presented and discussed to illustrate the methodology and bring to focus its benefits. These results show that the nearest neighbor decision system performance suffers little degradation when the given large training set is replaced by its much smaller MCS in the operational phase of testing with an independent test set. A direct experimental comparison with a prior approach is also furnished to further strengthen the case for the new methodology.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/21.278999","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/21.278999","startPage":"511","endPage":"517","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel1/21/6915/00278999.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6915","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Minimal consistent set (MCS) identification for optimal nearest neighbor decision systems design","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1994","displayDocTitle":"Minimal consistent set (MCS) identification for optimal nearest neighbor decision systems design","publicationDate":"March 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","volume":"24","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4684335","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/278999/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Minimal consistent set (MCS) identification for optimal nearest neighbor decision systems design","sourcePdf":"00278999.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.03945S","chronDate":"Mar 1994","isNumber":"6915","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"21","citationCount":"127","articleId":"278999","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":279000,"authors":[{"name":"Cheol Chang","affiliation":["Samsung Advanced Institute of Technology, Suwon, Kyunggi, South Korea"],"lastName":"Cheol Chang","id":"37382993800"},{"name":"Myung Jin Chung","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Taejon, South Korea"],"lastName":"Myung Jin Chung","id":"37348773500"},{"name":"Bum Hee Lee","affiliation":["Department of Control and Instrumentation Engineering, Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea"],"lastName":"Bum Hee Lee","id":"37067271300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9472"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2168-2909"}],"articleNumber":"279000","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":55,"citationCountPatent":6,"totalDownloads":418},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Systems, Man, and Cybernetics Society","url":"http://www.ieeesmc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Collision avoidance","Manipulators","Delay effects","Orbital robotics","Service robots","Robotics and automation","Parallel robots","Computer simulation","Machinery production industries","Manufacturing industries"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["path planning","industrial manipulators","delays","digital simulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["collision avoidance","robot manipulators","minimum delay time","polyhedra","distance functions","collision map scheme"]}],"abstract":"A simple time delay method for avoiding collisions between two general robot arms is proposed.

First, we accumulated expertise in the fields of computer graphics, mechanism analysis and solid modeling. Second, the appearance of 3D graphics workstations on the market allowed us to put our experience to work to develop CompAMM (Computer Analysis of Machines and Mechanisms), a general-purpose program to simulate and visualize in real time the kinematic analysis of complex articulated bodies. We got a Hewlett Packard 350 SRX in July 1987 and made our first presentation of the real-time analysis and visualization of 3D mechanisms at an international congress in Seville two months later.

The authors derive the autocorrelation function and determine the length of the correlated signal for various flow rates, comparing experimental measurements to theoretical predictions. High resolution experimental RF M-mode images are used to verify the theoretical model. Using a fluid with a density, viscosity, volume concentration, particle size, and speed of sound which is similar to that of blood, the authors show that the signal remains correlated for a long interval under many conditions of clinical interest. Including a comparison with experimental data, the effect of the lateral transit time through the sample volume and the axial velocity spread within the sample volume on the correlation of the received signal is evaluated. When a significant range of velocity components is present within the sample volume, this range is the limiting factor in the length of the correlated signal interval. Therefore, the use of a wideband signal, which reduces the sample volume size, produces a returned signal that may be correlated for a larger number of pulses, or for a longer time.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/58.279131","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6919","startPage":"185","endPage":"198","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","pdfPath":"/iel1/58/6919/00279131.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A statistical analysis of the received signal from blood during laminar flow","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/279131/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1994","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"A statistical analysis of the received signal from blood during laminar flow","publicationDate":"March 1994","accessionNumber":"4680189","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"41","issue":"2","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A statistical analysis of the received signal from blood during laminar flow","sourcePdf":"00279131.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.031899S","chronDate":"March  1994","isNumber":"6919","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"58","citationCount":"33","articleId":"279131","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":279132,"authors":[{"name":"S.R.

As a result, ultrasound has become extremely important to nondestructive testing of complete engineered systems. However, despite the fact that ultrasound inspection techniques are based on well-established principles, a few key problems pertaining to their application still remain unresolved. One of these problems deals with materials having complex geometries, often making the scanning/data collection processes time consuming. Consequently, fast and accurate mechanisms for testing components with awkward configurations have been the focus of attention in modern nondestructive testing research. In this paper, the data independent beamformer is studied as a potential method to reduce ultrasonic data acquisition time. The finite element method (FEM) is used as a testbed to mimic the ultrasound measurements by simulating the action of a transducer array. Tests reveal that when the weights of the interpolating filters (beamformers) are adjusted properly, they can indeed be used to predict A-scan signals from a data set produced by a transducer moving in a line-scan direction at nonuniform increments; hence, reducing the data acquisition time. The same filter weights also predict accurately A-scan signals from another data set produced by the same transducer moving at nonuniform increments for a different material geometry.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/279132/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1994","volume":"41","issue":"2","accessionNumber":"4680190","publicationDate":"March 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Application of a beamforming technique to ultrasound imaging in nondestructive testing","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Application of a beamforming technique to ultrasound imaging in nondestructive testing","sourcePdf":"00279132.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.059254S","chronDate":"March  1994","isNumber":"6919","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"58","citationCount":"12","articleId":"279132","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":279134,"authors":[{"name":"J.H.

It is based on a multicomponent scattering model for medical ultrasonics. The backscattered ultrasound quadrature signal is modeled as the sum of three components after demodulation. The first component represents nonresolvable diffuse scatterers, while the second component represents subresolvable quasi-periodic scatterers. The third component represents resolvable quasi-periodic scatterers and mirroring surfaces. Since the second component gives rise to the most long range destructive interference effects it is eliminated in the HI algorithm to reduce speckle. Due to its slow spatial variation, it can be almost completely eliminated simply by differentiating the backscattered demodulated quadrature signal. Lissajous-like figures are observed in complex plots of the signals from ultrasound beams going through tissues with quasi-periodic components and sometimes in areas with only diffuse scatterers. Therefore the sum of the complex signals from the resolvable and nonresolvable scatterers within a resolution cell is modeled by two orthogonal and independent harmonic oscillators. The estimated, total energy of these two oscillators determines the gray level value of the HI image within the resolution cell. The HI images produced using radio frequency data from a phantom and from tissues in vivo are more blurred than ordinary envelope images, but the signal to noise ratio and tissue contrast were higher for the HI images.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/58.279134","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6919","startPage":"215","endPage":"224","pdfPath":"/iel1/58/6919/00279134.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/58.279134","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Ultrasound speckle reduction using harmonic oscillator models","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Ultrasonic imaging","Speckle","Oscillators","Scattering","Signal resolution","Energy resolution","Biomedical imaging","Demodulation","Spatial resolution","Interference elimination"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomedical ultrasonics","acoustic imaging","speckle","transforms","harmonic analysis","image reconstruction","acoustic wave scattering","backscatter"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ultrasound speckle reduction","harmonic oscillator models","harmonic imaging algorithm","multicomponent scattering model","medical ultrasonics","backscattered ultrasound quadrature signal","nonresolvable diffuse scatterers","subresolvable quasi-periodic scatterers","resolvable quasi-periodic scatterers","mirroring surfaces","destructive interference effects","US imaging","backscattered demodulated quadrature signal","Lissajous-like figures","complex plots","tissues","quasi-periodic components","complex signals","phantom","envelope images","harmonic oscillators","total energy"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1994","displayDocTitle":"Ultrasound speckle reduction using harmonic oscillator models","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/279134/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","volume":"41","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4680192","publicationDate":"March 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ultrasound speckle reduction using harmonic oscillator models","sourcePdf":"00279134.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.04443S","chronDate":"March  1994","isNumber":"6919","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"58","citationCount":"14","articleId":"279134","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":279135,"authors":[{"name":"G.R.

The network theory model for a transducer is determined from a measurement of the transducer impedance in water and the pulse-echo response of the system for a given electrical source and load. A discussion of how this model can be used to optimize the design of an electrical matching circuit is given. This method is illustrated by designing a two-element transmission line matching circuit for a miniature 53 MHz transducer.

This paper describes a method for fabricating high frequency (53 MHz) spherically focused lead zirconate titanate (PZT) transducers. A transducer is fabricated by bonding a malleable backing layer onto a thin plate of PZT and then pressing the plate into a spherically shaped well. The backing layer evenly distributes stresses across the material when it is pressed into the well. Local concentrations of stress which lead to fracture are avoided and the material can be deformed without macroscopic cracking. The characteristics of a 2 mm diameter 53 MHz PZT transducer with a 4 mm focal length are described. A lateral beam width of 68 /spl mu/m and a 12 dB depth of field of 1.5 mm were obtained. The minimum two-way insertion loss of the system was /spl minus/25 dB and the 6 dB bandwidth of the pulse echo response was 30%. An image of a resolution phantom and an in vivo skin image illustrate the excellent imaging characteristics of the transducer.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/58.279136","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","pdfPath":"/iel1/58/6919/00279136.pdf","startPage":"231","endPage":"235","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/58.279136","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6919","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fabrication of high frequency spherically shaped ceramic transducers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=279136","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/279136/","displayDocTitle":"Fabrication of high frequency spherically shaped ceramic transducers","volume":"41","issue":"2","publicationDate":"March 1994","accessionNumber":"4684991","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fabrication of high frequency spherically shaped ceramic transducers","sourcePdf":"00279136.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036148S","chronDate":"March  1994","isNumber":"6919","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"58","citationCount":"101","articleId":"279136","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":279181,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

The necessary recurrent network parameters are then obtained by an inverse transformation that consists only of linear operators.

It is shown that the error has to be back-propagated through the adjoint model of the system and that the gradient can only be obtained after a delay. A faster version, accelerated back propagation, that eliminates this delay, is also developed. Various schemes including the sensitivity method are studied to update the weights of the network using these gradients. Motivated by the Lyapunov approach and the adjoint model, the predictive back propagation and its variant, targeted back propagation, are proposed. A further refinement, predictive back propagation with filtering is then developed, where the states of the model are also updated. The convergence of this scheme is assured. It is shown that it is sufficient to back propagate as many time steps as the order of the system for convergence. As a preamble, convergence of online batch and sample-wise updates in feedforward models is analyzed using the Lyapunov approach.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/72.279186","startPage":"213","endPage":"228","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel4/72/6922/00279186.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/72.279186","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6922","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Back propagation through adjoints for the identification of nonlinear dynamic systems using recurrent neural models","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Nonlinear dynamical systems","Neural networks","Convergence","Delay","Predictive models","Computational efficiency","Difference equations","Multilayer perceptrons","Nonlinear systems","Acceleration"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nonlinear dynamical systems","recurrent neural nets","identification","backpropagation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adjoints","identification","nonlinear dynamic systems","recurrent neural nets","gradient evaluation","accelerated back propagation","sensitivity method","predictive back propagation","targeted back propagation","filtering","convergence","batch updates","sample-wise updates","Lyapunov approach"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/279186/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1994","displayDocTitle":"Back propagation through adjoints for the identification of nonlinear dynamic systems using recurrent neural models","volume":"5","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4685628","pubMedId":"18267792","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Back propagation through adjoints for the identification of nonlinear dynamic systems using recurrent neural models","sourcePdf":"00279186.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.042231S","chronDate":"March  1994","isNumber":"6922","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"77","articleId":"279186","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":279187,"authors":[{"name":"Ah Chung Tsoi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Queensland, Saint Lucia, QLD, Australia"],"lastName":"Ah Chung Tsoi","id":"37087187529"},{"name":"A.D.

This algorithm is based on filtering outliers from the data and then estimating parameters from the filtered data. The filtering removes outliers from both the target function and the inputs of the neural network. The filtering is soft in that some outliers are neither completely rejected nor accepted. To show the need for robust recurrent networks, we compare the predictive ability of least squares estimated recurrent networks on synthetic data and on the Puget Power Electric Demand time series. These investigations result in a class of recurrent neural networks, NARMA(p,q), which show advantages over feedforward neural networks for time series with a moving average component. Conventional least squares methods of fitting NARMA(p,q) neural network models are shown to suffer a lack of robustness towards outliers. This sensitivity to outliers is demonstrated on both the synthetic and real data sets. Filtering the Puget Power Electric Demand time series is shown to automatically remove the outliers due to holidays.

The perceptron is a dynamic neural network, which appears effective in the input-output modeling of complex process systems. Dynamic gradient descent learning is used to train the recurrent multilayer perceptron, resulting in an order of magnitude improvement in convergence speed over a static learning algorithm used to train the same network. In developing the empirical process model the effects of actuator, process, and sensor noise on the training and testing sets are investigated. Learning and prediction both appear very effective, despite the presence of training and testing set noise, respectively. The recurrent multilayer perceptron appears to learn the deterministic part of a stochastic training set, and it predicts approximately a moving average response of various testing sets. Extensive model validation studies with signals that are encountered in the operation of the process system modeled, that is steps and ramps, indicate that the empirical model can substantially generalize operational transients, including accurate prediction of instabilities not in the training set. However, the accuracy of the model beyond these operational transients has not been investigated. Furthermore, online learning is necessary during some transients and for tracking slowly varying process dynamics. Neural networks based empirical models in some cases appear to provide a serious alternative to first principles models.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/279189/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1994","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4685631","pubMedId":"18267795","volume":"5","issue":"2","publicationDate":"March 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Application of the recurrent multilayer perceptron in modeling complex process dynamics","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Application of the recurrent multilayer perceptron in modeling complex process dynamics","sourcePdf":"00279189.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.046994S","chronDate":"March  1994","isNumber":"6922","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"135","articleId":"279189","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":279190,"authors":[{"name":"G.

An important problem in data communications is that of channel equalization, i.e., the removal of interferences introduced by linear or nonlinear message corrupting mechanisms, so that the originally transmitted symbols can be recovered correctly at the receiver. In this paper we introduce an adaptive recurrent neural network (RNN) based equalizer whose small size and high performance makes it suitable for high-speed channel equalization. We propose RNN based structures for both trained adaptation and blind equalization, and we evaluate their performance via extensive simulations for a variety of signal modulations and communication channel models. It is shown that the RNN equalizers have comparable performance with traditional linear filter based equalizers when the channel interferences are relatively mild, and that they outperform them by several orders of magnitude when either the channel's transfer function has spectral nulls or severe nonlinear distortion is present. In addition, the small-size RNN equalizers, being essentially generalized IIR filters, are shown to outperform multilayer perceptron equalizers of larger computational complexity in linear and nonlinear channel equalization cases.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/279190/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1994","volume":"5","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"March 1994","accessionNumber":"4685632","pubMedId":"18267796","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Using recurrent neural networks for adaptive communication channel equalization","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Using recurrent neural networks for adaptive communication channel equalization","sourcePdf":"00279190.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.168672S","chronDate":"March  1994","isNumber":"6922","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"201","articleId":"279190","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":279191,"authors":[{"name":"G.V.

Developments in the use of parameter-based extended Kalman filter algorithms for training recurrent networks may provide a mechanism by which these architectures will prove to be of practical value. This paper presents a decoupled extended Kalman filter (DEKF) algorithm for training of recurrent networks with special emphasis on application to control problems. We demonstrate in simulation the application of the DEKF algorithm to a series of example control problems ranging from the well-known cart-pole and bioreactor benchmark problems to an automotive subsystem, engine idle speed control. These simulations suggest that recurrent controller networks trained by Kalman filter methods can combine the traditional features of state-space controllers and observers in a homogeneous architecture for nonlinear dynamical systems, while simultaneously exhibiting less sensitivity than do purely feedforward controller networks to changes in plant parameters and measurement noise.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/72.279191","startPage":"279","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel4/72/6922/00279191.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/72.279191","endPage":"297","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6922","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neurocontrol of nonlinear dynamical systems with Kalman filter trained recurrent networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/279191/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1994","displayDocTitle":"Neurocontrol of nonlinear dynamical systems with Kalman filter trained recurrent networks","volume":"5","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4685633","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"March 1994","pubMedId":"18267797","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neurocontrol of nonlinear dynamical systems with Kalman filter trained recurrent networks","sourcePdf":"00279191.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.035677S","chronDate":"March  1994","isNumber":"6922","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"388","articleId":"279191","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":279192,"authors":[{"name":"A.J.

These are a class of recurrent networks obtained by adding trainable temporal elements to feedforward networks that makes the output history-sensitive. By virtue of this capability, these networks can identify dynamical systems without having to be explicitly fed with past inputs and outputs. Thus, they can identify systems whose order is unknown or systems with unknown delay. It is argued that for satisfactory modeling of dynamical systems, neural networks should be endowed with such internal memory. The paper presents a preliminary analysis of the learning algorithm, providing theoretical justification for the identification method. Methods for adaptive control of nonlinear systems using these networks are presented.

The unique feature of the proposed network is that it forms stable state representations during learning-previous work has shown that conventional analog recurrent networks can be inherently unstable in that they cannot retain their state memory for long input strings. The authors have previously introduced the discrete recurrent network architecture for learning finite-state automata. Here they extend this model to include a discrete external stack with discrete symbols. A composite error function is described to handle the different situations encountered in learning. The pseudo-gradient learning method (introduced in previous work) is in turn extended for the minimization of these error functions. Empirical trials validating the effectiveness of the pseudo-gradient learning method are presented, for networks both with and without an external stack. Experimental results show that the new networks are successful in learning some simple pushdown automata, though overfitting and non-convergent learning can also occur. Once learned, the internal representation of the network is provably stable; i.e., it classifies unseen strings of arbitrary length with 100% accuracy.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/72.279194","pdfPath":"/iel4/72/6922/00279194.pdf","startPage":"320","endPage":"330","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/72.279194","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6922","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Discrete recurrent neural networks for grammatical inference","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/279194/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1994","displayDocTitle":"Discrete recurrent neural networks for grammatical inference","volume":"5","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4685636","pubMedId":"18267800","publicationDate":"March 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Discrete recurrent neural networks for grammatical inference","sourcePdf":"00279194.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.075282S","chronDate":"March  1994","isNumber":"6922","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"45","articleId":"279194","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":279195,"authors":[{"name":"J.C.

In this approach, the concept of structural subband decomposition of 1D and 2D sequences is applied to an improved method for frequency-sampling FIR filter design. Using this decomposition the filter is implemented as a parallel connection (bank) of sparse subfilters cascaded with interpolators. An algebraic relationship is then developed to determine the frequency samples of the subband filters from the original specified frequency samples. Filter designs based on various types of interpolators derived from transform matrices such as the Hadamard, binomial, and DCT are investigated. Significant computational savings arise from discarding subbands that contribute little to the overall frequency response and selectively quantizing the wordsize of the coefficients of the remaining subfilters.

Surface electrodes were used for stimulation. The output of the knee joint-lower leg system was the angular position, velocity and acceleration. A model structure was taken from the literature and its complexity minimized based on the experiments and offline identification. The resulting model structure facilitates possible recursive identification. Model parameters of the lower leg dynamics were estimated using a least-squares algorithm in combination with the Levenburg-Marquardt algorithm. The intersubject variability in parameter values for the knee joint damping and the gravitational component appeared to be small when normalized to the inertia of the lower leg. The identified model for the knee joint and shank dynamics accurately predicted passive lower leg movement and could be used to estimate the magnitude of active knee torque due to elicited quadriceps contraction.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/279264/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1993","volume":"1","issue":"3","accessionNumber":"4690389","publicationDate":"Sept. 1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Identification of passive knee joint and shank dynamics in paraplegics using quadriceps stimulation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Identification of passive knee joint and shank dynamics in paraplegics using quadriceps stimulation","sourcePdf":"00279264.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.05157S","chronDate":"Sep 1993","isNumber":"6925","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"86","citationCount":"38","articleId":"279264","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":279267,"authors":[{"name":"P.S.

A prototype device was designed to measure and assist in a transport task, in which the two hands moved a pencil-like object rhythmically back and forth, and in a bimanual squeezing task, in which the two hands squeezed the object. The device, operating under simple proportional feedback control laws, could substitute completely for one hand in both tasks. When the device assisted a hand partially disabled by ischemia, it produced torque that the disabled hand did not, allowing the tasks to be performed. These results demonstrate the capability of a device, operating under simple control laws, to assist a disabled hand, allowing performance of coordinated bimanual tasks. Such a robot, extended to more useful bimanual activities of daily living, could afford cost effective, objectively measurable, self-driven therapy for a large patient population.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/86.279267","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Rehabilitation Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Rehabilitation Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel4/86/6925/00279267.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/86.279267","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6925","startPage":"185","endPage":"191","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robotic assist devices for bimanual physical therapy: preliminary experiments","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=279267","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Robotic assist devices for bimanual physical therapy: preliminary experiments","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/279267/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1993","isJournal":true,"volume":"1","issue":"3","publicationDate":"Sept. 1993","accessionNumber":"4690392","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robotic assist devices for bimanual physical therapy: preliminary experiments","sourcePdf":"00279267.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.025925S","chronDate":"Sep 1993","isNumber":"6925","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"86","citationCount":"70","articleId":"279267","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":279273,"authors":[{"name":"R.C.

Characterization and modeling of the external noise sources in these environments is in itself an important issue in noise compensation. The techniques described provide a mechanism for integrating parametric models of the acoustic background with the signal model so that noise compensation is tightly coupled with signal model training and classification. Prior information about the acoustic background process is provided using a maximum likelihood parameter estimation procedure that integrates an a priori model of the acoustic background with the signal model. An experimental study is presented on the application of this approach to text-independent speaker identification in noisy acoustic environments. Considerable improvement in speaker classification performance was obtained for classifying unlabeled sections of conversational speech utterances from a 16-speaker population under cross-environment training and testing conditions.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/89.279273","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Speech and Audio Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Speech and Audio Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/89/6926/00279273.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/89.279273","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6926","startPage":"245","endPage":"257","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Integrated models of signal and background with application to speaker identification in noise","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=279273","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Integrated models of signal and background with application to speaker identification in noise","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/279273/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1994","isJournal":true,"volume":"2","issue":"2","publicationDate":"April 1994","accessionNumber":"4676568","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Integrated models of signal and background with application to speaker identification in noise","sourcePdf":"00279273.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037348S","chronDate":"Apr 1994","isNumber":"6926","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"89","citationCount":"104","articleId":"279273","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":279277,"authors":[{"name":"A.V.

In general, active noise cancellation systems rely on multiple sensors to measure the unwanted noise field and the effect of the cancellation. This paper develops an approach that utilizes a single sensor. The noise field is modeled as a stochastic process, and a time-adaptive algorithm is used to adaptively estimate the parameters of the process. Based on these parameter estimates, a canceling signal is generated. In general, the transfer function characteristics from the canceling source to the error sensor need to be accounted for. If these can be accurately measured in advance and are invertible except for the propagation delay between the source and sensor, then the essential problem becomes one of predicting future values of the noise field. The algorithm developed is evaluated with both artificially generated noise and with recordings of aircraft noise.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pdfPath":"/iel4/89/6926/00279277.pdf","startPage":"285","endPage":"290","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Speech and Audio Processing","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6926","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/89.279277","doi":"10.1109/89.279277","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Speech and Audio Processing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=279277","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Noise cancellation","Active noise reduction","Sensor phenomena and characterization","Noise measurement","Parameter estimation","Noise generators","Noise reduction","Sensor systems","Stochastic processes","Signal generators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["noise abatement","acoustic noise measurement","acoustic field","stochastic processes","nonelectric sensing devices","acoustic signal processing","detectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["active noise cancellation","noise reduction","secondary noise source","noise field","single sensor","stochastic process","time-adaptive algorithm","parameter estimation","canceling signal","transfer function characteristics","canceling source","error sensor","propagation delay","aircraft noise recordings","artificially generated noise"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/279277/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1994","displayDocTitle":"Single-sensor active noise cancellation","accessionNumber":"4676572","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"April 1994","volume":"2","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Single-sensor active noise cancellation","sourcePdf":"00279277.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.050845S","chronDate":"Apr 1994","isNumber":"6926","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"89","citationCount":"53","articleId":"279277","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":279278,"authors":[{"name":"J.-L.

Three key issues of MAP estimation, namely, the choice of prior distribution family, the specification of the parameters of prior densities, and the evaluation of the MAP estimates, are addressed. Using HMM's with Gaussian mixture state observation densities as an example, it is assumed that the prior densities for the HMM parameters can be adequately represented as a product of Dirichlet and normal-Wishart densities. The classical maximum likelihood estimation algorithms, namely, the forward-backward algorithm and the segmental k-means algorithm, are expanded, and MAP estimation formulas are developed. Prior density estimation issues are discussed for two classes of applications/spl minus/parameter smoothing and model adaptation/spl minus/and some experimental results are given illustrating the practical interest of this approach. Because of its adaptive nature, Bayesian learning is shown to serve as a unified approach for a wide range of speech recognition applications.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/89.279278","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6926","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/89.279278","endPage":"298","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Speech and Audio Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Speech and Audio Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/89/6926/00279278.pdf","startPage":"291","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Maximum a posteriori estimation for multivariate Gaussian mixture observations of Markov chains","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/279278/","displayDocTitle":"Maximum a posteriori estimation for multivariate Gaussian mixture observations of Markov chains","volume":"2","issue":"2","accessionNumber":"4676573","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"April 1994","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Maximum a posteriori estimation for multivariate Gaussian mixture observations of Markov chains","sourcePdf":"00279278.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.042776S","chronDate":"Apr 1994","isNumber":"6926","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"89","citationCount":"1214","articleId":"279278","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":279281,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

These poles are estimated as the common values of many RTF's corresponding to different source and receiver positions. Since there is one-to-one correspondence between poles and AR coefficients, these poles are calculated as common AR coefficients by two methods: (i) using the least squares method, assuming all the given multiple RTF's have the same AR coefficients and (ii) averaging each set of AR coefficients estimated from each RTF. The estimated poles agree well with the theoretical poles when estimated with the same order as the theoretical pole order. When estimated with a lower order than the theoretical pole order, the estimated poles correspond to the major resonance frequencies, which have high Q factors. Using the estimated common AR coefficients, the proposed method models the RTF's with different MA coefficients. This model is called the common-acoustical-pole and zero (CAPZ) model, and it requires far fewer variable parameters to represent RTF's than the conventional all-zero or pole/zero model. This model was used for an acoustic echo canceller at low frequencies, as one example. The acoustic echo canceller based on the proposed model requires half the variable parameters and converges 1.5 times faster than one based on the all-zero model, confirming the efficiency of the proposed model.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/89.279281","pdfPath":"/iel4/89/6926/00279281.pdf","startPage":"320","endPage":"328","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Speech and Audio Processing","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Speech and Audio Processing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/89.279281","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6926","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Common acoustical pole and zero modeling of room transfer functions","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/279281/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1994","displayDocTitle":"Common acoustical pole and zero modeling of room transfer functions","volume":"2","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4676576","publicationDate":"April 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Common acoustical pole and zero modeling of room transfer functions","sourcePdf":"00279281.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.054286S","chronDate":"Apr 1994","isNumber":"6926","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"89","citationCount":"84","articleId":"279281","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-10"},{"_id":279283,"authors":[{"name":"O.

It is a generalization of the set covering (or unate covering) problem, where f is positive unate, and is generally given as a table with rows corresponding to the set elements and the columns corresponding to the subsets. Previous methods have considered the case when f is given as a product-of-sum formula or as a binary decision diagram (BDD).

Experimental results on ISCAS-85 circuits show that for relatively small numbers of diagnoses, a precomputed dictionary is more efficient.

Optimal application-specific architectures are synthesized to minimize latency given constraints on chip area, I/O pin count and interchip communication delays. A mathematical integer programming (IP) model for simultaneously partitioning, scheduling, and allocating hardware (functional units, I/O pins, and interchip buses) is formulated. By exploiting the problem structure (using polyhedral theory), the size of the search space is decreased and a new variable selection strategy is introduced based on the branch and bound algorithm. Multichip optimal architectures for several examples are synthesized in practical CPU times. Execution times are comparable to those for previous heuristic approaches. There are, however, significant improvements in optimal schedules and allocations of multichips.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal synthesis of multichip architectures","publicationTitle":"1992 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer-Aided Design","doi":"10.1109/ICCAD.1992.279367","displayPublicationTitle":"1992 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer-Aided Design","pdfPath":"/iel2/894/6927/00279367.pdf","startPage":"238","endPage":"241","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCAD.1992.279367","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6927","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=279367","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/279367/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 Nov. 1992","displayDocTitle":"Optimal synthesis of multichip architectures","conferenceDate":"8-12 Nov. 1992","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1992","accessionNumber":"4618062","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal synthesis of multichip architectures","confLoc":"Santa Clara, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00279367.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.032058S","chronDate":"8-12 Nov. 1992","isNumber":"6927","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"894","citationCount":"24","articleId":"279367","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":279372,"authors":[{"name":"Saab","affiliation":["Coordinated Sci.

The approach is based on continuous mutation of a given input sequence and on analyzing the mutated vectors for selecting the test set. The approach uses a hierarchical simulation technique in the analysis to drastically reduce the memory requirement, thus allowing the test generation for large VLSI circuits. The algorithms are at the switch level so that general MOS digital designs can be handled, and both stuck-at and transistor faults are handled accurately. The approach was implemented in a hierarchical test generation system, CRIS, that runs under UNIX on SPARC workstations.

Issues that differentiate LUT synthesis from conventional logic synthesis are emphasized. The ability of a K-input LUT to implement any Boolean function of K variables differentiates the synthesis of LUT circuits from that for conventional ASIC technologies. The major different occurs during the technology mapping phase of logic synthesis. For values of K greater than 3, the larger number of functions that can be implemented by a K-input LUT makes it impractical to use a conventional library-based technology mapping. However, the completeness of the set of functions that can be implemented by a LUT eliminates the need for a library of separate functions. In addition, this completeness can be leveraged to optimize the final circuit.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICCAD.1992.279399","publicationTitle":"1992 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer-Aided Design","displayPublicationTitle":"1992 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer-Aided Design","pdfPath":"/iel2/894/6927/00279399.pdf","startPage":"40","endPage":"47","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCAD.1992.279399","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6927","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=279399","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A tutorial on logic synthesis for lookup-table based FPGAs","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 Nov. 1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/279399/","displayDocTitle":"A tutorial on logic synthesis for lookup-table based FPGAs","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"8-12 Nov. 1992","accessionNumber":"4618030","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A tutorial on logic synthesis for lookup-table based FPGAs","confLoc":"Santa Clara, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00279399.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062498S","chronDate":"8-12 Nov. 1992","isNumber":"6927","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"894","citationCount":"10","articleId":"279399","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":279401,"authors":[{"name":"Shenoy","affiliation":["Department of EECS, University of California, Berkeley, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Shenoy","id":"37282455600"},{"name":"Brayton","affiliation":["Department of EECS, University of California, Berkeley, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Brayton","id":"37275814500"},{"name":"Sangiovanni-Vincentelli","affiliation":["Department of EECS, University of California, Berkeley, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Sangiovanni-Vincentelli","id":"38271978500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-8186-3010-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"279401","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":40,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":65},"abstract":"For performance-driven synthesis of sequential circuits, the optimal clocking problem is considered, and it is shown that it is reducible to a parametric shortest path problem.

Virtual wires overcome pin limitations by intelligently multiplexing each physical wire among multiple logical wires and pipelining these connections at the maximum clocking frequency of the FPGA. A virtual wire represents a connection from a logical output on one FPGA to a logical input on another FPGA. Virtual wires not only increase usable bandwidth, but also relax the absolute limits imposed on gate utilization. The resulting improvement in bandwidth reduces the need for global interconnect, allowing effective use of low dimension inter-chip connections (such as nearest-neighbor). Nearest-neighbor topologies, coupled with the ability of virtual wires to overlap communication with computation, can even improve emulation speeds. The authors present the concept of virtual wires and describe their first implementation, a 'softwire' compiler which utilizes static routing and relies on minimal hardware support. Results from compiling netlists for the 18 K gate Sparcle microprocessor and the 86 K gate Alewife Communications and Cache Controller indicate that virtual wires can increase FPGA gate utilization beyond 80 percent without a significant slowdown in emulation speed.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","publicationTitle":"[1993] Proceedings IEEE Workshop on FPGAs for Custom Computing Machines","displayPublicationTitle":"[1993] Proceedings IEEE Workshop on FPGAs for Custom Computing Machines","pdfPath":"/iel2/917/6928/00279469.pdf","startPage":"142","endPage":"151","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Virtual wires: overcoming pin limitations in FPGA-based logic emulators","doi":"10.1109/FPGA.1993.279469","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6928","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FPGA.1993.279469","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=279469","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/279469/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 Apr 1993","displayDocTitle":"Virtual wires: overcoming pin limitations in FPGA-based logic emulators","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1993","accessionNumber":"4630534","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"5-7 April 1993","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Virtual wires: overcoming pin limitations in FPGA-based logic emulators","confLoc":"Napa, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00279469.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.027014S","chronDate":"5-7 Apr 1993","isNumber":"6928","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"917","citationCount":"74","articleId":"279469","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":279474,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Several configuration RAM modules are provided inside the FPGA chip, and the configuration of the gate array can be rapidly changed by replacing the active module. Data for configuration are transferred from an off-chip backup RAM to an unused configuration RAM module. A novel computation mechanism called the WASMII, which executes a target data flow graph directly, is proposed on the basis of the virtual hardware. A WASMII chip consists of the FPGA for virtual hardware and the additional mechanism to replace configuration RAM modules in the data driven manner. Configuration data are preloaded by the order which is assigned in advance with a static scheduling preprocessor. By connecting a number of WASMII chips, a highly parallel system can be easily constructed.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hardware","Field programmable gate arrays","Read-write memory","Digital circuits","Scheduling algorithm","Processor scheduling","Joining processes","Circuit faults","Analog computers","Large scale integration"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["logic arrays","multiprocessor interconnection networks","reconfigurable architectures","scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data flow machine","multiprocessor scheduling algorithm","virtual hardware","extended Field Programmable Gate Array","configuration RAM modules","FPGA chip","off-chip backup RAM","data flow graph","WASMII chip","data driven","static scheduling preprocessor"]}],"doi":"10.1109/FPGA.1993.279481","publicationTitle":"[1993] Proceedings IEEE Workshop on FPGAs for Custom Computing Machines","displayPublicationTitle":"[1993] Proceedings IEEE Workshop on FPGAs for Custom Computing Machines","pdfPath":"/iel2/917/6928/00279481.pdf","startPage":"33","endPage":"42","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6928","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FPGA.1993.279481","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"WASMII: a data driven computer on a virtual hardware","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=279481","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"WASMII: a data driven computer on a virtual hardware","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/279481/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1993","accessionNumber":"4630522","conferenceDate":"5-7 April 1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 Apr 1993","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"WASMII: a data driven computer on a virtual hardware","confLoc":"Napa, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00279481.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039149S","chronDate":"5-7 Apr 1993","isNumber":"6928","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"917","citationCount":"48","articleId":"279481","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":279483,"authors":[{"name":"C.

The neural network and FIR filters are combined with the self-learning mechanism to make the adaptive system operate distributively and parallelly. The important feature of the adaptive system is that the several parallel filters form a supersphere of N-dimensional space in which there is a centre and around it several W try to cover the overall supersphere. The suboptimal W can be quickly selected and then self-learning performance uses LMS to find the W and a new supersphere is built by the knowledge of topological space. Adaptive time is as fast as possible and can be modified as demanded. A new concept in which a supersphere moves according to nonstationary signals in N-dimensional space is presented.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6929","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIE.1992.279570","publicationTitle":"[1992] Proceedings of the IEEE International Symposium on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"[1992] Proceedings of the IEEE International Symposium on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel2/553/6929/00279570.pdf","startPage":"281","endPage":"284 vol.1","doi":"10.1109/ISIE.1992.279570","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Self-learning forward neural network to realize adaptive FIR filter","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-29 May 1992","displayDocTitle":"Self-learning forward neural network to realize adaptive FIR filter","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"25-29 May 1992","publicationDate":"1992","accessionNumber":"4529165","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/279570/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Self-learning forward neural network to realize adaptive FIR filter","confLoc":"Xi'an, China","sourcePdf":"00279570.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070791S","chronDate":"25-29 May 1992","isNumber":"6929","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"553","articleId":"279570","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":279572,"authors":[{"name":"Zhou Jinrong","affiliation":["Research Institute of Automatic Control, East China University of Chemical Technology, Shanghai, China"],"lastName":"Zhou Jinrong","id":"37087259764"},{"name":"Jiang Weisun","affiliation":["Research Institute of Automatic Control, East China University of Chemical Technology, Shanghai, China"],"lastName":"Jiang Weisun","id":"37087260307"},{"name":"Huang Dao","affiliation":["Research Institute of Automatic Control, East China University of Chemical Technology, Shanghai, China"],"lastName":"Huang Dao","id":"37087261087"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-0042-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"279572","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":24},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Stochastic systems","Nonlinear dynamical systems","Stochastic resonance","Neural networks","Backpropagation","Network synthesis","Stochastic processes","Input variables","Optimization methods","Inductors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["backpropagation","feedforward neural nets","optimisation","stochastic systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nonlinear control problems","stochastic dynamic system","neural networks","industry application","optimization problems","multilayered backpropagation network","trained network","modelling","urea reactor"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=279572","abstract":"Neural networks can be used to solve highly nonlinear control and optimization problems relating to the determinate processes. In fact, much of the real processes are dynamic systems with noise. The authors study the modelling and optimization of a kind of stochastic dynamic system via neural networks. First, the sample patterns and the corresponding mean value patterns of the dynamic system will be used to train a multilayered backpropagation network. Then, the trained network is used to synthesize the mean value of the inputs which minimize a given stochastic objective function. The authors choose the incremental operation scheme to get optimal mean value of the input variables for overcoming the difficulty of getting entire knowledge in a time. Finally, the authors apply previous modelling and optimization methods to solve the optimal problem of a practical urea reactor.

They propose an interaction between stacked DRAM design and process called the bridge-gap process for achieving low digit-line resistance while minimizing overall process complexity. A study of digit-line resistance as a function of word-line gap and digit-line poly-Si thickness indicates that there is a well-defined, poly-Si dependent forbidden gap which gives rise to high, variable, and even open digit-line resistance. After word-line (n-channel transistor) spacer formation, digit-line buried contact formation, and digit-line poly-Si deposition, this gap partially closes and so presents a deep trench, which the LPCVD (low pressure chemical vapor deposited) WSi/sub x/ cannot adequately cover. For a minimum digit-line poly-Si thickness that can withstand the WSi/sub x/ stress, word-line gaps are designed so that they are either less than (bridged digit-line) or greater than (gapped digit-line) the forbidden gap.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/IEMT.1991.279803","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IEMT.1991.279803","publicationTitle":"[1991 Proceedings] Eleventh IEEE/CHMT International Electronics Manufacturing Technology Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"[1991 Proceedings] Eleventh IEEE/CHMT International Electronics Manufacturing Technology Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel2/584/6930/00279803.pdf","startPage":"310","endPage":"314","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6930","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/279803/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 Sep 1991","displayDocTitle":"Bridge-gap buried digit-line for high density stacked DRAMs","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"16-18 Sept. 1991","accessionNumber":"4224896","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1991","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bridge-gap buried digit-line for high density stacked DRAMs","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00279803.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044826S","chronDate":"16-18 Sep 1991","isNumber":"6930","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"584","articleId":"279803","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":279850,"authors":[{"name":"K.G.

To cope with degradation due to fast fading, linear predictive transmitter diversity (LPTD) is proposed. Using the measured received level just before the end of the received burst signal, linear prediction of the signal level of the next time slot at the reception side can be made.

The mitigation effect is shown here by a reduction of the coefficient of variation of the received power as a function of bandwidth spreading. The parameters chip rate, processing gain and the number of multipath components tracked are investigated for their effect upon the mitigation-the mitigation effect is sensitive to combinations of these parameters.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.1992.279878","publicationTitle":"[1992 Proceedings] The Third IEEE International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"[1992 Proceedings] The Third IEEE International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications","pdfPath":"/iel2/1036/6931/00279878.pdf","startPage":"508","endPage":"512","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.1992.279878","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6931","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Wideband DS/CDMA signals in multipath fading channels: analysis, simulation and measurements","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=279878","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 Oct 1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/279878/","displayDocTitle":"Wideband DS/CDMA signals in multipath fading channels: analysis, simulation and measurements","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1992","accessionNumber":"4635557","conferenceDate":"19-21 Oct. 1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wideband DS/CDMA signals in multipath fading channels: analysis, simulation and measurements","confLoc":"Boston, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"00279878.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046539S","chronDate":"19-21 Oct 1992","isNumber":"6931","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1036","citationCount":"3","articleId":"279878","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":279881,"authors":[{"name":"R.J.

The idea of using median type filtering as an aiding device for the matched filter is presented.

The authors develop a new multistage detector using the transformation proposed by Carter (1984) to approach the optimal solution. The transformation modifies the diagonal elements of the hessian matrix of the quadratic function corresponding to the optimal receiver and brings the continuous minimum of the transformed function as closely to the optimal solution as possible. The convergence of the new multistage algorithms is studied. The computational complexity is essentially linear with the number of users except that a few computations of a quadratic function are needed. The numerical results for the detection of synchronous CDMA signals are shown to be very encouraging.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"[1992 Proceedings] The Third IEEE International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications","pdfPath":"/iel2/1036/6931/00279890.pdf","startPage":"446","endPage":"450","publicationTitle":"[1992 Proceedings] The Third IEEE International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.1992.279890","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.1992.279890","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6931","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=279890","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multistage detection in synchronous code-division multiple-access systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiaccess communication","Detectors","Computational complexity","Decorrelation","Signal detection","Code division multiplexing","Spread spectrum communication","Interference","Bandwidth","Ear"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","computational complexity","convergence","matrix algebra","signal detection","synchronisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["synchronous code-division multiple-access systems","multistage detector","optimal solution","diagonal elements","hessian matrix","quadratic function","optimal receiver","transformed function","multistage algorithms convergence","computational complexity","CDMA signals","signal detection"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/279890/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 Oct 1992","displayDocTitle":"Multistage detection in synchronous code-division multiple-access systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1992","accessionNumber":"4635545","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"19-21 Oct. 1992","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multistage detection in synchronous code-division multiple-access systems","confLoc":"Boston, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"00279890.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.028284S","chronDate":"19-21 Oct 1992","isNumber":"6931","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1036","articleId":"279890","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":279891,"authors":[{"name":"V.-P.

This amplifier uses a new method for adaptively controlling the local signal phase in a Cartesian demodulator. They tested the soft-landing Cartesian feedback (SLCFB) method in the 900 MHz band using pi /4-shifted QPSK modulation to determine its applicability for pocket terminals in Japanese digital cellular systems. They developed a smooth loop-gain control mechanism using a variable gain amplifier with an FET and a continuous phase-shifter control circuit for digital processing in the IF band. They showed that the SL-CFB method can maintain the optimum local signal phase in the demodulator. This method therefore solves the problem at applying CFB amplifiers. They adopted circuit configurations that are easy to incorporate into LSI chips so that the amplifier can be used in compact terminals. The results show that the SL-CFB amplifier is a promising candidate for developing highly efficient linear amplifiers, which are very important in digital cellular telephone terminals.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.1992.279898","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.1992.279898","startPage":"402","endPage":"406","displayPublicationTitle":"[1992 Proceedings] The Third IEEE International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications","pdfPath":"/iel2/1036/6931/00279898.pdf","publicationTitle":"[1992 Proceedings] The Third IEEE International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6931","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cartesian feedback amplifier with soft landing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 Oct 1992","displayDocTitle":"Cartesian feedback amplifier with soft landing","conferenceDate":"19-21 Oct. 1992","publicationDate":"1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"4635537","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/279898/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cartesian feedback amplifier with soft landing","confLoc":"Boston, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"00279898.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043882S","chronDate":"19-21 Oct 1992","isNumber":"6931","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1036","citationCount":"9","articleId":"279898","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":279905,"authors":[{"name":"R.

While CDMA has been shown to offer significant capacity advantage over narrowband TDMA alternatives, these gains are very sensitive to the propagation loss coefficient gamma . Most analytical studies for CDMA system capacity are based on an assumption of propagation loss coefficient gamma =4, consistent with large cell sizes associated with present day cellular radio. However, in microcellular (i.e., cell sizes with radius approximately 100's of meters) environments, the path loss coefficient can vary in the range of 2 to 4. In addition, attenuation measurements using low antenna heights for microcells have indicated that the path loss coefficient may not be a constant, increasing with distance between the base station and the subscriber terminal. A distance-dependent model for the propagation loss coefficient gamma is considered and used to compute the capacity of a cellular packet CDMA system operating in an integrated voice/data PCN environment. System-level performance measures such as channel utilization, voice packet loss probability and data delay are derived from a detailed channel event based simulation model, and compared for alternative scenarios with constant gamma and distance dependent gamma .<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Effect of propagation loss coefficient on the performance of a packet CDMA PCN","publicationTitle":"[1992 Proceedings] The Third IEEE International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.1992.279905","displayPublicationTitle":"[1992 Proceedings] The Third IEEE International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications","pdfPath":"/iel2/1036/6931/00279905.pdf","startPage":"367","endPage":"371","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.1992.279905","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6931","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=279905","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/279905/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 Oct 1992","displayDocTitle":"Effect of propagation loss coefficient on the performance of a packet CDMA PCN","conferenceDate":"19-21 Oct. 1992","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1992","accessionNumber":"4635530","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Effect of propagation loss coefficient on the performance of a packet CDMA PCN","confLoc":"Boston, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"00279905.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042174S","chronDate":"19-21 Oct 1992","isNumber":"6931","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1036","citationCount":"1","articleId":"279905","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":279906,"authors":[{"name":"R.

Such errors turn up in the fades even when the channel is short-term invariant and the receiver is stationary.

The performance is measured in terms of receiver error probability and throughput. An enhanced performance is obtained by using error correction coding. In spite of the use of error correction coding, a packet can be in error, i.e. the receiver erroneously detects a codeword that none of the terminals transmitted. Bounded distance decoding can be used effectively to reduce the packet error probability. A comparison of the performance is presented for a specific code with equal Hamming distance d/sub min/, exchanging between the error correcting and error detecting capability of that code.

In mobile radio systems applying CDMA, multipath propagation leads on the one hand to ISI and on the other hand, together with time-variance, to cross interference between the signals of different users, regardless whether the user codes are chosen orthogonal or not. A linear unbiased data estimation algorithm is presented which cancels both ISI and cross interference perfectly by jointly detecting the different user signals, thus leading to unbiased estimates of the transmitted data symbols. This algorithm is less complex than MLSE performed e.g. by the Viterbi algorithm and furthermore, the complexity does not depend on the kind of the applied linear modulation scheme, which opens a simple way to offer services with different data rates in one system. By theoretical analysis and simulation, the performance of the unbiased data estimation algorithm is examined under the assumption that the radio channel impulse responses are known at the receiver. The price to be paid for the interference cancellation is SNR-degradations, which are calculated for typical mobile radio situations in urban areas. The resulting average uncoded bit error probabilities lead to the conclusion that systems applying the unbiased data estimation algorithm are well-suited for mobile radio applications.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.1992.279952","publicationTitle":"[1992 Proceedings] The Third IEEE International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"[1992 Proceedings] The Third IEEE International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications","pdfPath":"/iel2/1036/6931/00279952.pdf","startPage":"118","endPage":"122","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.1992.279952","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6931","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Simultaneous cancellation of cross interference and ISI in CDMA mobile radio communications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=279952","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 Oct 1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/279952/","displayDocTitle":"Simultaneous cancellation of cross interference and ISI in CDMA mobile radio communications","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1992","accessionNumber":"4635483","conferenceDate":"19-21 Oct. 1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Simultaneous cancellation of cross interference and ISI in CDMA mobile radio communications","confLoc":"Boston, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"00279952.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052561S","chronDate":"19-21 Oct 1992","isNumber":"6931","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1036","citationCount":"20","articleId":"279952","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":279953,"authors":[{"name":"S.

In cellular applications, however, the effects of interference are further compounded by the multipath fading environment, because each interferer can generate several interfering rays. To reduce the effects of these interferences, M-ary signaling can be used together with the diversity antenna combining. A CDMA cellular system is analyzed that utilizes these techniques.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"[1992 Proceedings] The Third IEEE International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications","pdfPath":"/iel2/1036/6931/00279954.pdf","startPage":"108","endPage":"111","publicationTitle":"[1992 Proceedings] The Third IEEE International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.1992.279954","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.1992.279954","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6931","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=279954","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance analysis of a CDMA cellular system in the multipath fading environment","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Performance analysis","Multiaccess communication","Fading","Interference","Diversity reception","Nonlinear filters","Delay","Bismuth","Frequency synchronization","Costs"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","channel capacity","code division multiple access","diversity reception","fading","interference suppression","radiofrequency interference","telecommunication signalling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CDMA cellular system","multipath fading","mutual synchronization","interference","M-ary signaling","diversity antenna combining","code division multiple access"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/279954/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 Oct 1992","displayDocTitle":"Performance analysis of a CDMA cellular system in the multipath fading environment","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1992","accessionNumber":"4635481","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"19-21 Oct. 1992","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance analysis of a CDMA cellular system in the multipath fading environment","confLoc":"Boston, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"00279954.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.023034S","chronDate":"19-21 Oct 1992","isNumber":"6931","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1036","citationCount":"18","articleId":"279954","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":279955,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Such a receiver, while optimum in additive white Gaussian noise, may yield poor performance when multiple-access noise is the dominant interference. Previously proposed multiple-user receivers greatly improve performance in this situation, but quickly become prohibitively complex for systems of realistic size. The authors propose a receiver which takes advantage of the colored power spectrum of the multiple-access noise to reject it. The receiver is simple to implement, can run at high rates, and can be tuned adaptively. It is designed to maximize signal-to-noise ratio, but is also shown to yield a substantial improvement over the conventional receiver in average probability of error.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"[1992 Proceedings] The Third IEEE International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications","pdfPath":"/iel2/1036/6931/00279955.pdf","startPage":"103","endPage":"107","publicationTitle":"[1992 Proceedings] The Third IEEE International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.1992.279955","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.1992.279955","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6931","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=279955","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Implementation of a CDMA receiver with multiple-access noise rejection","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiaccess communication","Additive white noise","Gaussian noise","AWGN","Matched filters","Multiple access interference","Finite impulse response filter","Signal to noise ratio","Colored noise","Signal design"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","error statistics","interference suppression","radio receivers","white noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DS-CDMA receiver","multiple-access noise rejection","transversal filter","colored power spectrum","signal-to-noise ratio","average probability of error","tap weights"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/279955/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 Oct 1992","displayDocTitle":"Implementation of a CDMA receiver with multiple-access noise rejection","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1992","accessionNumber":"4635480","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"19-21 Oct. 1992","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Implementation of a CDMA receiver with multiple-access noise rejection","confLoc":"Boston, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"00279955.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.035104S","chronDate":"19-21 Oct 1992","isNumber":"6931","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1036","citationCount":"6","articleId":"279955","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":279956,"authors":[{"name":"P.

For residential and commercial areas, where the buildings are of nearly uniform height, prediction of cell shape will require knowledge of how the average signal received by street level mobiles depends on the direction of propagation relative to the rows of buildings. This paper presents theoretical results for the signal dependence on direction of propagation, number of intervening rows of buildings and the base station antenna height. Assuming all buildings to be of equal heights, the range dependence of the average signal is found by evaluating multiple forward diffraction past rows of buildings, perpendicular or oblique to the propagation path.
