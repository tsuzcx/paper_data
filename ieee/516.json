Increasingly, computer control algorithms reside inside individual system components in a distributed fashion. Variable Camshaft Timing (VCT) is an appealing feature for automotive engines because it allows optimization of the cam timing over a wide range of operating conditions. In this paper, a method to distribute the discrete MIMO controller for the VCT Engine to improve the component swapping modularity of the VCT Actuator and the EGO Sensor components using network communications is presented. First a discrete LQG controller was designed then this controller was distributed to the ECU, the VCT controller and the EGO sensor controller in order to improve the component swapping modularity of the system. A control oriented pre-optimization technique, which simplifies the optimization problem and a candidate solution was devised to maximize component modularity.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5160005/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 June 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"10-12 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","dateOfInsertion":"10 July 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5160005/","accessionNumber":"10775310","displayDocTitle":"Modular discrete optimal MIMO controller for a VCT Engine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modular discrete optimal MIMO controller for a VCT Engine","confLoc":"St. Louis, MO, USA","sourcePdf":"0338.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058579S","chronDate":"10-12 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5089257","isNumber":"5159764","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5089257","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5159764","articleId":"5160005","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"AACC American Automatic Control Council","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5160014,"authors":[{"name":"J.

The purpose of this paper is to present some new results in this sense. In particular, for the neural identifier, a new online learning law which permits to guarantee the boundedness for both the weights and the identification error without using a dead zone function is showed. Likewise, based on this neural identifier, a new control law to guarantee the boundedness of the tracking error is developed. These results are proved using a Lyapunov like analysis. With respect to the approach based on the local optimal control theory, the new approach has a similar performance but its main advantage consists of simplifying considerably the design process.

It is a powerful approach to cope with the model nonlinearity and uncertainties. Existing ACD-based controllers have been proven as uniformly ultimately bounded (UUB). However, UUB only makes the tracking error converge to a certain bounded region. Although we can minimize the bounded region by increasing the number of the hidden nodes of the neural networks in the ACD, the computation cost of the ACD-based controller increases. In many engineering applications, we prefer the asymptotical stability which can ensure the tracking error converges to zero. In this paper, we propose a novel asymptotically stable ACD-based controller for a class of uncertain nonlinear systems. This controller firstly uses the feedback linearization to improve the system dynamic characteristics, and then combines ACD and variable structure control to achieve the asymptotical stability under large model uncertainties. An empirical study is conducted on a 2-link manipulator to validate the new controller design approach. Results show that the nonlinear system using the proposed controller can achieve asymptotical stability and good dynamic response characteristics when large model uncertainties exist.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Asymptotically stable adaptive critic design for uncertain nonlinear systems","publicationTitle":"2009 American Control Conference","doi":"10.1109/ACC.2009.5160047","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 American Control Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5089257/5159764/05160047.pdf","startPage":"5156","endPage":"5161","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACC.2009.5160047","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5159764","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5160047","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5160047/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"Asymptotically stable adaptive critic design for uncertain nonlinear systems","conferenceDate":"10-12 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5160047/","dateOfInsertion":"10 July 2009","publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10775145","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Asymptotically stable adaptive critic design for uncertain nonlinear systems","confLoc":"St. Louis, MO, USA","sourcePdf":"0403.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060612S","chronDate":"10-12 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5089257","isNumber":"5159764","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5089257","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5159764","articleId":"5160047","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"AACC American Automatic Control Council","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5160051,"authors":[{"name":"A.

Irregular routes are preferred, to reduce the ability of an adversary to predict the patrol routes of the UAVs. In this paper, we consider a team of potentially heterogeneous, dynamically constrained UAVs with constant velocities. The problem is approached as a finite horizon optimization to account for possible alarms as they occur. This approach seeks to optimize the amount of information obtained by the UAVs, with surveillance of pop-up alarms a high but not sole priority. Particle swarm optimization (PSO) is used to search the control space and optimize the reward function.

Some numerical simulations are presented to illustrate the utility of our theoretical results.","doi":"10.1109/ACC.2009.5160054","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACC.2009.5160054","startPage":"4525","endPage":"4530","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 American Control Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5089257/5159764/05160054.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 American Control Conference","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5159764","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Consensus in networked multi-agent systems via sampled control: Switching topology case","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"Consensus in networked multi-agent systems via sampled control: Switching topology case","conferenceDate":"10-12 June 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","dateOfInsertion":"10 July 2009","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5160054/","accessionNumber":"10775130","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5160054/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Consensus in networked multi-agent systems via sampled control: Switching topology case","confLoc":"St. Louis, MO, USA","sourcePdf":"0412.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.090008S","chronDate":"10-12 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5089257","isNumber":"5159764","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5089257","citationCount":"52","xplore-issue":"5159764","articleId":"5160054","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"AACC American Automatic Control Council","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5160063,"authors":[{"name":"Marvin H.-M.

The problem of solving the HJB equation is therefore converted to estimating the parameters of the RBFNN.

Legislation that will be applied to diesel engines during the period 2010\u20132020 continue to put great emphasis on both nitrogen oxides NO\n<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">x</inf>\n and particulate matter (PM). With the increasing effort to reduce emissions and maintain fuel economy manufacturers are focussing on engine control. Engine control requires data acquisition and acquisition requires sensors, but hardware in the form of sensors adds further cost to the production. As a result, so called virtual sensors are introduced. These are estimators that predict the required data, which is costly to measure or simply incapable of measurement. In this paper a parallel neural network structure is built. It consists of three Non-linear autoregressive exogenous input (NLARX) neural network models used to predict the smoke emissions of a diesel engine operated in a Non-Road-Transient Cycle. Existing resources from Matlab toolboxes are used in order to monitor both the cost and computational expenses of analysis. The data is re-ordered into training and validation sets and processed. To overcome the weakness of the neural network approach in respect of high frequency signals, the data is divided into layers to split up the frequencies and cut high amplitudes. Three horizontal layers of the signal are processed in parallel through independent NLARX-models and their performances are added to give an overall result.","doi":"10.1109/ACC.2009.5160119","startPage":"1122","endPage":"1127","publicationTitle":"2009 American Control Conference","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACC.2009.5160119","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5159764","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 American Control Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5089257/5159764/05160119.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Diesel engine emissions prediction using parallel neural networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5160119/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Diesel engine emissions prediction using parallel neural networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5160119/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10775411","publicationDate":"June 2009","dateOfInsertion":"10 July 2009","conferenceDate":"10-12 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 June 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Diesel engine emissions prediction using parallel neural networks","confLoc":"St. Louis, MO, USA","sourcePdf":"0520.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051298S","chronDate":"10-12 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5089257","isNumber":"5159764","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5089257","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"5159764","articleId":"5160119","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"AACC American Automatic Control Council)","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":5160131,"authors":[{"name":"K.

The current effort builds on our previous efforts to illustrate how a NN can be combined with a recent robust feedback method to asymptotically minimize a given quadratic performance index as the generalized coordinates of a nonlinear Euler-Lagrange system asymptotically track a desired time-varying trajectory despite general uncertainty in the dynamics.

Moreover, in the HVAC industry, it is generally preferred to tune multiple single-input-single-output (SISO) control loops rather than a single multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) control loop. This paper shows that when using an appropriate choice of feedback variables, a decentralized control approach consisting of individual SISO control loops performs as well as a MIMO control approach. An identified system model is shown to be diagonally dominant when using a decoupling set of input-output pairings. A linear quadratic Gaussian (LQG) control design is compared to a decentralized SISO control design through experimental results. Both controllers produce comparable time-domain performance characteristics.","doi":"10.1109/ACC.2009.5160155","publicationTitle":"2009 American Control Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 American Control Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5089257/5159764/05160155.pdf","startPage":"1580","endPage":"1585","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACC.2009.5160155","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5159764","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Comparison of SISO and MIMO control techniques for a diagonally dominant vapor compression system","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5160155","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 June 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5160155/","displayDocTitle":"Comparison of SISO and MIMO control techniques for a diagonally dominant vapor compression system","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10775224","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5160155/","conferenceDate":"10-12 June 2009","dateOfInsertion":"10 July 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparison of SISO and MIMO control techniques for a diagonally dominant vapor compression system","confLoc":"St. Louis, MO, USA","sourcePdf":"0570.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04921S","chronDate":"10-12 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5089257","isNumber":"5159764","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5089257","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5159764","articleId":"5160155","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"AACC American Automatic Control Council","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5160192,"authors":[{"name":"Yongcan Cao","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Utah State University, Logan, UT, USA"],"firstName":"Yongcan","lastName":"Cao","id":"37403071600"},{"name":"Wei Ren","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Utah State University, Logan, UT, USA"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Ren","id":"37271980400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4523-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4524-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0743-1619"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2378-5861"}],"articleNumber":"5160192","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":16,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":276},"abstract":"This paper studies two discrete-time formation control algorithms for multi-vehicle systems with double-integrator dynamics in a sampled-data setting under dynamic directed interaction.

Decentralized maneuver design is shown to enhance the network tolerance to loss of sensors, in addition to reducing the complexity in computation and communications. Sensing accuracy and speed are achieved by a high-level aggregation of the sensor outputs and a time-coordinated bang-bang control of the sensor carrying vehicles to their best sensing states. The solution is demonstrated through a network of airborne location sensors, where the sensors are paired to acquire time difference of arrival and frequency difference of arrival of microwave signals for localization of their emitters to a required accuracy in minimum time. Network resilience to localizing emitters in the face of vehicle loss is shown via simulations of a six-sensor network with respect to a range of vehicle loss probabilities.","doi":"10.1109/ACC.2009.5160196","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 American Control Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5089257/5159764/05160196.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5159764","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACC.2009.5160196","publicationTitle":"2009 American Control Conference","startPage":"233","endPage":"239","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sensor maneuver design for microwave source localization","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5160196","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"Sensor maneuver design for microwave source localization","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5160196/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5160196/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10775215","dateOfInsertion":"10 July 2009","conferenceDate":"10-12 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sensor maneuver design for microwave source localization","confLoc":"St. Louis, MO, USA","sourcePdf":"0630.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062186S","chronDate":"10-12 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5089257","isNumber":"5159764","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5089257","xplore-issue":"5159764","articleId":"5160196","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"AACC American Automatic Control Council","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5160221,"authors":[{"name":"Ya-Qin Zheng","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics and Physics, Liaoning University of Technology, Jinzhou, China"],"firstName":"Ya-Qin","lastName":"Zheng","id":"37579144300"},{"name":"Yan-Jun Liu","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics and Physics, Liaoning University of Technology, Jinzhou, China"],"firstName":"Yan-Jun","lastName":"Liu","id":"37577989800"},{"name":"Shao-Cheng Tong","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics and Physics, Liaoning University of Technology, Jinzhou, China"],"firstName":"Shao-Cheng","lastName":"Tong","id":"37271148100"},{"name":"Tie-Shan Li","affiliation":["School of Naval Architecture, Ocean and Civil Engineering, Shanghai Jiaotong University, Shanghai, China","Navigation College, Dalian Maritime University, Dalian, China"],"firstName":"Tie-Shan","lastName":"Li","id":"37280718500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4523-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4524-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0743-1619"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2378-5861"}],"articleNumber":"5160221","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":161},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5160221","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Combined adaptive fuzzy control for uncertain MIMO nonlinear systems","abstract":"A combined adaptive fuzzy control method of a class of uncertain MIMO nonlinear systems is studied in this paper. In this method, the proposed controllers consist of two parts: the direct and indirect adaptive control terms. Compared with existing methods for controlling MIMO systems, this novel method can trade off fuzzy descriptions for control rules at the same time to achieve better adaptation properties and improve control effect. In addition, most methods need to assume that the minimum approximation error is required to satisfy the square-integrable condition. The method proposed in this paper doesn't need this assumption, and the effect of minimum approximation error could be removed by the adaptive compensation term. Based on Lyapunov stability theory, it can be ensured that all signals of closed-loop system are bounded, and the tracking errors converge to a small neighborhood around zero.

In this paper, the same idea is used for decomposition of feedback systems, with dynamics in both decision variables and prices. We show how the prices can be used for a decentralized test, to verify that the global feedback system stays within a prespecified distance from optimality.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5160224/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 June 2009","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"10-12 June 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5160224/","dateOfInsertion":"10 July 2009","publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10775438","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic dual decomposition for distributed control","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic dual decomposition for distributed control","confLoc":"St. Louis, MO, USA","sourcePdf":"0666.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045509S","chronDate":"10-12 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5089257","isNumber":"5159764","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5089257","citationCount":"103","xplore-issue":"5159764","articleId":"5160224","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"AACC American Automatic Control Council","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5160230,"authors":[{"name":"Jing Lu","affiliation":["Control Science and Engineering Research Center, Jiangnan University, Wuxi, China"],"firstName":"Jing","lastName":"Lu","id":"37088279496"},{"name":"Xinggao Liu","affiliation":["College of Information Science and Engineering, University of Zhejiang, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Xinggao","lastName":"Liu","id":"37086913862"},{"name":"Feng Ding","affiliation":["Control Science and Engineering Research Center, Jiangnan University, Wuxi, China"],"firstName":"Feng","lastName":"Ding","id":"37381405000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4523-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4524-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0743-1619"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2378-5861"}],"articleNumber":"5160230","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":98},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Parameter estimation","Iterative algorithms","Colored noise","Iterative methods","Fault diagnosis","Control systems","Sampling methods","Transfer functions","Frequency","Optimal control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["iterative methods","least squares approximations","parameter estimation","sampled data systems","state-space methods","transfer functions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["least-squares based iterative parameter estimation","two-input multirate sampled-data systems","colored noises","state-space model","transfer function","least-squares based iterative algorithm"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5160230","doi":"10.1109/ACC.2009.5160230","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACC.2009.5160230","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5159764","publicationTitle":"2009 American Control Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 American Control Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5089257/5159764/05160230.pdf","startPage":"4379","endPage":"4383","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Least-squares based iterative parameter estimation for two-input multirate sampled-data systems","abstract":"This paper studies identification problems for two-input multirate systems with colored noises (The method in the paper can be easily extended to multi-input multirate systems).

The unknown cycle ambiguity between GPS satellites and antennas at the moment of receiving the CP signal should be resolved for precise navigation. The sequential Monte Carlo filter approach, called particle filter (PF), is applied to the relative positioning problem which includes the ambiguity resolution problem for the CP nonlinear observation and dynamic equations. The proposed algorithm of GPS CP navigation is based on two main factors. First, even though most existing GPS CP navigation algorithms focus on obtaining the correct integer value among the integer candidates, we directly sample from the three dimensional position space and construct integers consistent with the PF. This allows the PF position estimates to be insensitive to changes of GPS satellites and cycle-slips. Second, the potential large number of samples in position space is handled with the resampling technique in the sequential particle filters. The experimental results show the performance and the advantages of the proposed approach compared to the existing methods.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Global Positioning System","Particle filters","Position measurement","Signal resolution","Satellite navigation systems","Antenna measurements","Extraterrestrial measurements","Aerospace engineering","Control systems","Receiving antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Global Positioning System","Monte Carlo methods","nonlinear equations","particle filtering (numerical methods)","satellite antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["GPS carrier-phase positioning system","particle filter","position sample","unknown cycle ambiguity resolution problem","GPS satellite","GPS antenna","sequential Monte Carlo filter approach","CP nonlinear observation equation","CP nonlinear dynamic equation"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ACC.2009.5160276","publicationTitle":"2009 American Control Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 American Control Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5089257/5159764/05160276.pdf","startPage":"4171","endPage":"4177","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5159764","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACC.2009.5160276","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Relative GPS Carrier-Phase positioning using particle filters with position samples","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5160276","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Relative GPS Carrier-Phase positioning using particle filters with position samples","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5160276/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5160276/","accessionNumber":"10775582","conferenceDate":"10-12 June 2009","dateOfInsertion":"10 July 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 June 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Relative GPS Carrier-Phase positioning using particle filters with position samples","confLoc":"St. Louis, MO, USA","sourcePdf":"0749.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048825S","chronDate":"10-12 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5089257","isNumber":"5159764","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5089257","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"5159764","articleId":"5160276","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"AACC American Automatic Control Council)","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5160279,"authors":[{"name":"Zhao Lu","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, AL, USA"],"lastName":"Zhao Lu","id":"37535423300"},{"name":"Jing Sun","affiliation":["Department of Naval Architecture and Marine Engineering and the Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA"],"lastName":"Jing Sun","id":"37293638400"},{"name":"Dongkyoung Lee","affiliation":["Department of Naval Architecture and Marine Engineering, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA"],"lastName":"Dongkyoung Lee","id":"37578847400"},{"name":"Ken Butts","affiliation":["North America Technical Center, Toyota Motor Corporation, Ann Arbor, MI, USA"],"lastName":"Ken Butts","id":"37330706200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4523-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4524-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0743-1619"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2378-5861"}],"articleNumber":"5160279","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":131},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Dynamic programming","Linear programming","Internal combustion engines","Vehicle dynamics","Statistical learning","Support vector machines","Sun","Petroleum","Automotive engineering","Calibration"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["internal combustion engines","linear programming","mechanical engineering computing","regression analysis","support vector machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dynamic engine modeling","support vector regression","linear programming","internal combustion engine","L4 gasoline engine"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we develop a dynamic model for an internal combustion engine using Support Vector Regression (SVR).

We propose a new framework that allows the nodes to build a map of the parameter of interest with a small number of measurements. By using the recent results in the area of compressive sensing, we show how the nodes can exploit the sparse representation of the parameter of interest in the transform domain in order to build a map with minimal sensing. The proposed work allows the nodes to efficiently map the areas that are not sensed directly. To illustrate the performance of the proposed framework, we show how the nodes can build an aerial map or a map of obstacles with sparse sensing. We furthermore show how our proposed framework enables a novel non-invasive approach to mapping obstacles by using wireless channel measurements.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Compressive cooperative sensing and mapping in mobile networks","publicationTitle":"2009 American Control Conference","doi":"10.1109/ACC.2009.5160306","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 American Control Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5089257/5159764/05160306.pdf","startPage":"3397","endPage":"3404","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACC.2009.5160306","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5159764","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5160306","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5160306/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"Compressive cooperative sensing and mapping in mobile networks","conferenceDate":"10-12 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5160306/","dateOfInsertion":"10 July 2009","publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10775612","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Compressive cooperative sensing and mapping in mobile networks","confLoc":"St. Louis, MO, USA","sourcePdf":"0789.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075068S","chronDate":"10-12 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5089257","isNumber":"5159764","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5089257","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"5159764","articleId":"5160306","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"AACC American Automatic Control Council","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5160336,"authors":[{"name":"Oktay Arslan","affiliation":["Controls and Avionics Laboratory, Istanbul Technical University, Istanbul, Turkey"],"firstName":"Oktay","lastName":"Arslan","id":"37572575200"},{"name":"Gokhan Inalhan","affiliation":["Faculty of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Istanbul Technical University, Istanbul, Turkey"],"firstName":"Gokhan","lastName":"Inalhan","id":"37572573400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4523-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4524-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0743-1619"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2378-5861"}],"articleNumber":"5160336","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":163},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An event driven decision support algorithm for command and control of UAV fleets","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Command and control systems","Unmanned aerial vehicles","Processor scheduling","Robustness","Partitioning algorithms","Iterative algorithms","Large-scale systems","Dynamic scheduling","Resource management","Computational complexity"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["aircraft","command and control systems","decision making","remotely operated vehicles","scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["command and control","UAV fleets scheduling problem","event driven decision support algorithm","computational complexity","earliest start time algorithm"]}],"abstract":"In this work, we focus on solving large-scale UAV fleets scheduling problem in dynamically changing (i.e. external event-driven or operator induced selection) scenarios.

In Club-based Particle Swarm Optimization (C-PSO) algorithm, each particle initially joins a default number of social groups (clubs). Each particle is affected by its own experience and the experience of the best performing member of the social groups it is a member of. In the proposed Adaptive membership C-PSO (AMC-PSO), a time varying default Membership is introduced. This modification enables the particles to explore the space based on their own experience in the first stage, and to intensify the connections of the social network in later stages to avoid premature convergence. This proposed dynamic neighborhood algorithm is compared with other PSO algorithms having both static and dynamic neighborhood topologies on a set of classic benchmark problems. The results showed superior performance for AMC-PSO regarding its ability to escape from local optima, while its speed of convergence is comparable to other algorithms.","doi":"10.1109/ACC.2009.5160390","publicationTitle":"2009 American Control Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 American Control Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5089257/5159764/05160390.pdf","startPage":"5628","endPage":"5634","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACC.2009.5160390","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5159764","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Clubs-based Particle Swarm Optimization","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5160390","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 June 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5160390/","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Clubs-based Particle Swarm Optimization","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10775695","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5160390/","conferenceDate":"10-12 June 2009","dateOfInsertion":"10 July 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Clubs-based Particle Swarm Optimization","confLoc":"St. Louis, MO, USA","sourcePdf":"0915.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053986S","chronDate":"10-12 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5089257","isNumber":"5159764","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5089257","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5159764","articleId":"5160390","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"AACC American Automatic Control Council)","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5160423,"authors":[{"name":"Zhen Song","affiliation":["Siemens AG Corporate Research and Development, Princeton, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Zhen","lastName":"Song","id":"37086662865"},{"name":"Chellury Ram Sastry","affiliation":["Siemens AG Corporate Research and Development, Princeton, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Chellury Ram","lastName":"Sastry","id":"37583359500"},{"name":"Nazif Cihan Tas","affiliation":["Siemens AG Corporate Research and Development, Princeton, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Nazif Cihan","lastName":"Tas","id":"37297201000"},{"name":"YangQuan Chen","affiliation":["CSOIS, Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, Utah State University, Logan, UT, USA"],"firstName":"YangQuan","lastName":"Chen","id":"37281026000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4523-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4524-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0743-1619"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2378-5861"}],"articleNumber":"5160423","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":210},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5160423","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sensor systems","Wireless sensor networks","Sensor phenomena and characterization","Costs","Counting circuits","Batteries","Optimal control","Control systems","Educational institutions","Computer networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["matrix algebra","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimal sensor selection","cyber-physical systems","wireless sensor network","onboard battery energy conservation","convex analysis","Fisher information matrix","sensor deployment pattern","Caratheodorys theory","sensor density"]}],"abstract":"A fundamental question for observation systems based on wireless sensor network (WSN) is to achieve the best tradeoff between estimation precision and many design factors. One challenge of this kind is to select a small number of sensors, if possible, to observe the environment, and thus conserve precious onboard battery energy by transmitting only valuable data to the base station. Although many sensor selection methods have been proposed, the analysis on this problem is relatively limited. Based on the theory of optimal experimental design and convex analysis, we present some feasibility analysis on the optimal sensor selection problem. Equipped with Fisher information matrix, we show that there exists a threshold, which we named Carath\u00e9odor's limit, such that the optimal estimation is always feasible as far as the number of selected sensors is no less than that limit. We also investigated on the difference between the total sample number and the total sensor number. Discussions on some necessary conditions of sensor density and sensor deployment patterns are included too. We argue that sensor selection methods have potentials to save significant amount of energy for a large class of embedded wireless sensor networks without sacrificing estimation accuracy.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5159764","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACC.2009.5160423","publicationTitle":"2009 American Control Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 American Control Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5089257/5159764/05160423.pdf","startPage":"5368","endPage":"5373","doi":"10.1109/ACC.2009.5160423","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Feasibility analysis on optimal sensor selection in cyber-physical systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"Feasibility analysis on optimal sensor selection in cyber-physical systems","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"10-12 June 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5160423/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10775728","dateOfInsertion":"10 July 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5160423/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Feasibility analysis on optimal sensor selection in cyber-physical systems","confLoc":"St. Louis, MO, USA","sourcePdf":"0964.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062631S","chronDate":"10-12 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5089257","isNumber":"5159764","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5089257","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5159764","articleId":"5160423","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"AACC American Automatic Control Council)","lastupdate":"2021-12-20"},{"_id":5160424,"authors":[{"name":"A.

As a prominent example, the considered information constraints on the controller structure include decentralized and distributed control over a given communication network. The main contribution of this paper is twofold. Firstly, we introduce the notion of structured control Lyapunov functions (CLFs) as a suitable tool for stabilizing controller synthesis under information constraints. This includes the relaxation of Lyapunov conditions at the local level.

In the first part of the paper, it was shown that the quantized consensus is reached by means of a stochastic gossip algorithm proposed in a recent paper, for any arbitrary quantization.

This quantity (corresponding to the worst case) is lower and upper bounded in terms of the topology of the graph, for uniform quantization. In particular, it is shown that the upper bound is related to the principal minors of the weighted Laplacian matrix.

The control objective for the follower UAV is to track its leader at a desired-separation, angle of incidence, and a bearing by using an auxiliary velocity control. Then, a novel neural network (NN) control law for the dynamical system is introduced to learn the complete dynamics of the UAV including unmodeled dynamics like aerodynamic friction. Additionally, the interconnection dynamic errors between the leader and its followers are explicitly considered, and the stability of the entire formation is demonstrated using Lyapunov theory. Numerical results verify the theoretical conjectures.","doi":"10.1109/ACC.2009.5160591","startPage":"2990","endPage":"2996","publicationTitle":"2009 American Control Conference","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACC.2009.5160591","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5159764","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 American Control Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5089257/5159764/05160591.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neural network control of quadrotor UAV formations","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5160591/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Neural network control of quadrotor UAV formations","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5160591/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10775967","publicationDate":"June 2009","dateOfInsertion":"10 July 2009","conferenceDate":"10-12 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 June 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural network control of quadrotor UAV formations","confLoc":"St. Louis, MO, USA","sourcePdf":"1196.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.11393S","chronDate":"10-12 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5089257","isNumber":"5159764","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5089257","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"5159764","articleId":"5160591","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"AACC American Automatic Control Council","lastupdate":"2021-11-11"},{"_id":5160595,"authors":[{"name":"P.

Automobiles have a large impact on increasing energy demand, pollution and related issues. As a consequence, many efforts are being concentrated on innovative systems for transportation that could replace petroleum with cleaner fuel, i.e. electricity from the power grid. The use of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) can become a very important change in this direction, since such vehicles could benefit from the increasing availability of renewable energy. PHEVs requires new control and energy management algorithms, that are crucial for vehicle performance. This paper deals with evaluation of two modes, Electric Vehicle (EV) mode and Blended mode, for plug-in hybrid electric vehicles and their comparison with conventional and hybrid electric vehicle performance. In this paper two PHEV architectures are considered: through road parallel plug-in hybrid and series plug-in hybrid. Similar models have been developed to evaluate vehicle performance for conventional and hybrid architectures. Both PHEV architectures are analyzed with two different modes- EV and Blended; a modified version of ECMS (Equivalent Consumption Minimization Strategy) is used for both algorithms. Various standard as well as custom designed driving cycles are used in this analysis. The paper provides quantitative analysis of the control algorithms to analyze their effects on fuel economy, use of electric energy, cost of operation, etc.; these results are compared with the simulations for hybrid and conventional vehicles. Some important relationships between fuel economy, design architectures and control strategies are shown and can be useful in the design of the optimal control algorithms for PHEVs. As shown in the results, the control problem for PHEVs is not limited to fuel economy but it also involves external factors, such as price of electricity, energy market and regulations, charging availability, battery life issues, etc.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Algorithm design and analysis","Hybrid electric vehicles","Fuel economy","Petroleum","Costs","Optimal control","Oil pollution","Global warming","Automobiles","Transportation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["control system synthesis","energy management systems","energy resources","hybrid electric vehicles","optimal control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["plug-in hybrid electric vehicles control strategies","renewable energy","energy management algorithms","parallel plug-in hybrid","series plug-in hybrid","equivalent consumption minimization strategy","fuel economy","electric energy","operation cost","optimal control algorithms design","energy market","energy regulations","charging availability","battery life issues"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ACC.2009.5160595","publicationTitle":"2009 American Control Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 American Control Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5089257/5159764/05160595.pdf","startPage":"3950","endPage":"3955","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5159764","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACC.2009.5160595","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Effects of different PHEV control strategies on vehicle performance","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5160595","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Effects of different PHEV control strategies on vehicle performance","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5160595/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5160595/","accessionNumber":"10775971","conferenceDate":"10-12 June 2009","dateOfInsertion":"10 July 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 June 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Effects of different PHEV control strategies on vehicle performance","confLoc":"St. Louis, MO, USA","sourcePdf":"1202.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046636S","chronDate":"10-12 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5089257","isNumber":"5159764","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5089257","citationCount":"82","xplore-issue":"5159764","articleId":"5160595","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"AACC American Automatic Control Council","lastupdate":"2021-12-24"},{"_id":5160623,"authors":[{"name":"Qiuming Gong","affiliation":["University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, Milwaukee, WI, USA"],"firstName":"Qiuming","lastName":"Gong","id":"37585383900"},{"name":"Yaoyu Li","affiliation":["University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, Milwaukee, WI, USA"],"firstName":"Yaoyu","lastName":"Li","id":"37279897900"},{"name":"Zhongren Peng","affiliation":["University of Florida at Gainesville, Gainesville, FL, USA"],"firstName":"Zhongren","lastName":"Peng","id":"37537015100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4523-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4524-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0743-1619"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2378-5861"}],"articleNumber":"5160623","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":36,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1012},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Energy management","Hybrid electric vehicles","Neural networks","Power system modeling","Fuel economy","Power system management","Dynamic programming","Intelligent transportation systems","Telecommunication traffic","Traffic control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automated highways","battery powered vehicles","dynamic programming","electrical engineering computing","hybrid electric vehicles","neural nets","partial differential equations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["plug-in hybrid electric vehicle","neural network based trip modeling","charge-depletion power management","global optimization techniques","two-scale dynamic programming approach","historical traffic flow data","advanced traffic flow modeling","gas-kinetic based model","partial deferential equation based model","WisTransPortal","fuel economy"]}],"abstract":"The plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEV), utilizing more battery power, has become a next-generation HEV with great promise of higher fuel economy. Global optimization charge-depletion power management would be desirable. This has so far been hampered due to the a priori nature of the trip information and the almost prohibitive computational cost of global optimization techniques such as dynamic programming (DP). Combined with the intelligent transportation systems (ITS), our previous work developed a two-scale dynamic programming approach as a nearly globally optimized charge-depletion strategy for PHEV power management. Trip model is obtained via GPS, GIS, real-time and historical traffic flow data and advanced traffic flow modeling. The gas-kinetic based model was used for the trip modeling in our previous study. The complicated partial deferential equation based model with several parameters needs to be calibrated had for implementation. In this paper, a neural network based trip model was developed for the highway portion, using the given data from WisTransPortal. The real test data was used for the training and validation of the network. The simulation results show that the obtained trip model using neural network can greatly improve the trip modeling accuracy, and thus improve the fuel economy. The potential of the advantages were indicated by the fuel economy comparison.","doi":"10.1109/ACC.2009.5160623","publicationTitle":"2009 American Control Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 American Control Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5089257/5159764/05160623.pdf","startPage":"4601","endPage":"4606","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACC.2009.5160623","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5159764","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Power management of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles using neural network based trip modeling","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5160623","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 June 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5160623/","displayDocTitle":"Power management of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles using neural network based trip modeling","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10775999","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5160623/","conferenceDate":"10-12 June 2009","dateOfInsertion":"10 July 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power management of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles using neural network based trip modeling","confLoc":"St. Louis, MO, USA","sourcePdf":"1236.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.095048S","chronDate":"10-12 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5089257","isNumber":"5159764","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5089257","citationCount":"36","xplore-issue":"5159764","articleId":"5160623","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"AACC American Automatic Control Council)","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":5160639,"authors":[{"name":"Rishi Graham","affiliation":["Department of Applied Mathematics and Statistics, University of California, Santa Cruz, USA"],"firstName":"Rishi","lastName":"Graham","id":"37411343300"},{"name":"Jorge Cortes","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, University of California, San Diego, USA"],"firstName":"Jorge","lastName":"Cortes","id":"37286603500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4523-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4524-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0743-1619"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2378-5861"}],"articleNumber":"5160639","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":91},"abstract":"This paper considers robotic sensor networks performing spatial estimation tasks.

The contribution of the paper is twofold. First, the issue of guaranteeing the recursive feasibility of the optimization problem associated to the receding horizon control law has been addressed, such that the invariance of the feasible region under the networked closed-loop dynamics can be guaranteed.

Conventional ideas on stopping stochastic approximation algorithms employ criteria based on a proxy distribution - usually the asymptotic distribution. Yet difficulties may arise when applying such distributions to small (finite) samples. We propose an approach that uses the distribution of a statistically similar process called a surrogate for the proxy distribution rather than the asymptotic distribution. Under certain conditions, surrogate-based probability calculations are close to the actual probabilities. The question of how surrogate processes may be developed is also addressed. Two example applications are given.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5159764","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACC.2009.5160713","publicationTitle":"2009 American Control Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 American Control Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5089257/5159764/05160713.pdf","startPage":"26","endPage":"31","doi":"10.1109/ACC.2009.5160713","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Stopping small-sample stochastic approximation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"Stopping small-sample stochastic approximation","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"10-12 June 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5160713/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10776089","dateOfInsertion":"10 July 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5160713/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Stopping small-sample stochastic approximation","confLoc":"St. Louis, MO, USA","sourcePdf":"1361.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052549S","chronDate":"10-12 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5089257","isNumber":"5159764","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5089257","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5159764","articleId":"5160713","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"AACC American Automatic Control Council","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5160719,"authors":[{"name":"YangQuan Chen","affiliation":["Center for Self-Organizing and Intelligent Systems (CSOIS), Utah State University, Logan, UT, USA"],"firstName":"YangQuan","lastName":"Chen","id":"37088280231"},{"name":"Ivo Petras","affiliation":["Institute of Control and Informatization of Production Processes, BERG Faculty, Technical University of Ko\u0161ice, Slovak Republic"],"firstName":"Ivo","lastName":"Petras","id":"37415647800"},{"name":"Dingyu Xue","affiliation":["Faculty of Information Sciences and Engineering, Northeastern University, Shenyang, China"],"firstName":"Dingyu","lastName":"Xue","id":"37302101500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4523-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4524-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0743-1619"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2378-5861"}],"articleNumber":"5160719","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":435,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":6608},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Tutorial","Fractional calculus","Control systems","Three-term control","Electrical equipment industry","Industrial control","Numerical simulation","Voltage","Propagation losses","Transmission line theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["control engineering education","differentiation","integration","three-term control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fractional order control","real dynamic systems","noninteger order dynamic model","fractional calculus","integer order differentiation","integer order integration","PID controllers","discretization techniques"]}],"abstract":"Many real dynamic systems are better characterized using a non-integer order dynamic model based on fractional calculus or, differentiation or integration of non-integer order. Traditional calculus is based on integer order differentiation and integration. The concept of fractional calculus has tremendous potential to change the way we see, model, and control the nature around us. Denying fractional derivatives is like saying that zero, fractional, or irrational numbers do not exist. In this paper, we offer a tutorial on fractional calculus in controls. Basic definitions of fractional calculus, fractional order dynamic systems and controls are presented first. Then, fractional order PID controllers are introduced which may make fractional order controllers ubiquitous in industry. Additionally, several typical known fractional order controllers are introduced and commented. Numerical methods for simulating fractional order systems are given in detail so that a beginner can get started quickly. Discretization techniques for fractional order operators are introduced in some details too. Both digital and analog realization methods of fractional order operators are introduced. Finally, remarks on future research efforts in fractional order control are given.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fractional order control - A tutorial","publicationTitle":"2009 American Control Conference","doi":"10.1109/ACC.2009.5160719","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 American Control Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5089257/5159764/05160719.pdf","startPage":"1397","endPage":"1411","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACC.2009.5160719","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5159764","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5160719","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5160719/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"Fractional order control - A tutorial","conferenceDate":"10-12 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5160719/","dateOfInsertion":"10 July 2009","publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10776095","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fractional order control - A tutorial","confLoc":"St. Louis, MO, USA","sourcePdf":"1371.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.142885S","chronDate":"10-12 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5089257","isNumber":"5159764","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5089257","citationCount":"435","xplore-issue":"5159764","articleId":"5160719","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"AACC American Automatic Control Council","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":5160883,"authors":[{"name":"Koji Nakano","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, Hiroshima University, Hiroshima, Japan"],"firstName":"Koji","lastName":"Nakano","id":"37339557400"},{"name":"Kensuke Kawakami","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, Hiroshima University, Hiroshima, Japan"],"firstName":"Kensuke","lastName":"Kawakami","id":"37576249500"},{"name":"Koji Shigemoto","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, Hiroshima University, Hiroshima, Japan"],"firstName":"Koji","lastName":"Shigemoto","id":"37572858500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3751-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3750-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1530-2075"}],"articleNumber":"5160883","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":14,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":438},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"RSA encryption and decryption using the redundant number system on the FPGA","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Symposium on Parallel & Distributed Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5136864/5160846/05160883.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Symposium on Parallel & Distributed Processing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IPDPS.2009.5160883","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5160846","doi":"10.1109/IPDPS.2009.5160883","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cryptography","Field programmable gate arrays","Hardware","Clocks","Adders","Acceleration","Delay effects","Circuits","Added delay","Arithmetic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","multiplying circuits","public key cryptography","random-access storage"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["RSA encryption","decryption","redundant number system","FPGA","Montgomery modulo multiplication","k-bit block RAM","embedded multiplier","clock cycles","modulo exponentiation hardware algorithm","Xilinx VirtexII Pro family"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5160883","abstract":"The main contribution of this paper is to present efficient hardware algorithms for the modulo exponentiation P\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">E</sup>\n mod M used in RSA encryption and decryption, and implement them on the FPGA.

We compare and contrast the performance and monetary cost-benefits of clouds for desktop grid applications, ranging in computational size and storage. We address the following questions: (i) What are the performance tradeoffs in using one platform over the other? (ii) What are the specific resource requirements and monetary costs of creating and deploying applications on each platform? (iii) In light of those monetary and performance cost-benefits, how do these platforms compare? (iv) Can cloud computing platforms be used in combination with desktop grids to improve cost-effectiveness even further?

There is an infrequent feedback loop in P7Viterbi to update the value of beginning state (B state), which limits further parallelization. Previous work either ignored the feedback loop or serialized the process, leading to loss of either precision or efficiency. Our proposed syslolic array based architecture with a parallel data providing unit can exploit maximum parallelism of the full version of P7Viterbi. The proposed architecture speculatively runs with fully parallelism assuming that the feedback loop does not take place. If the rare feedback case actually occurs, a rollback mechanism is used to ensure correctness. Results show that by using Xilinx Virtex-5 110T FPGA, the proposed architecture with 20 PEs can achieve about a 56.8 times speedup compared with that of Intel Core2 Duo 2.33 GHz CPU.","doi":"10.1109/IPDPS.2009.5160927","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Symposium on Parallel & Distributed Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Symposium on Parallel & Distributed Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5136864/5160846/05160927.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IPDPS.2009.5160927","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5160846","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Accelerating HMMer on FPGAs using systolic array based architecture","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5160927","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-29 May 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5160927/","displayDocTitle":"Accelerating HMMer on FPGAs using systolic array based architecture","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10750245","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5160927/","conferenceDate":"23-29 May 2009","dateOfInsertion":"10 July 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Accelerating HMMer on FPGAs using systolic array based architecture","confLoc":"Rome, Italy","sourcePdf":"HiCOMB-1569170903-paper-1.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.106578S","chronDate":"23-29 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5136864","isNumber":"5160846","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5136864","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"5160846","articleId":"5160927","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5160929,"authors":[{"name":"N.

The growth of biological sequence data has significantly out-paced Moore's law. This development also poses new computational and architectural challenges for the field of phylogenetic inference, i.e., the reconstruction of evolutionary histories (trees) for a set of organisms which are represented by respective molecular sequences. Phylogenetic trees are currently increasingly reconstructed from multiple genes or even whole genomes. The introduced term \"phylogenomics\" reflects this development. Hence, there is an urgent need to deploy and develop new techniques and computational solutions to calculate the computationally intensive scoring functions for phylogenetic trees. In this paper, we propose a dedicated computer architecture to compute the phylogenetic maximum likelihood (ML) function. The ML criterion represents one of the most accurate statistical models for phylogenetic inference and accounts for 85% to 95% of total execution time in all state-of-the-art ML-based phylogenetic inference programs. We present the implementation of our architecture on an FPGA (field programmable gate array) and compare the performance to an efficient C implementation of the ML function on a high-end multi-core architecture with 16 cores. Our results are two-fold: (i) the initial exploratory implementation of the ML function for trees comprising 4 up to 512 sequences on an FPGA yields speedups of a factor 8.3 on average compared to execution on a single-core and is faster than the OpenMP-based parallel implementation on up to 16 cores in all but one case; and (ii) we are able to show that current FPGAs are capable to efficiently execute floating point intensive computational kernels.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Acceleration","Phylogeny","Computer architecture","Explosions","Moore's Law","Biology computing","History","Organisms","Genomics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biology computing","computer architecture","field programmable gate arrays","genetics","molecular biophysics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FPGA","biological wet lab techniques","pyrosequencing","molecular data explosion","biological sequence data","phylogenetic inference","molecular sequences","phylogenetic trees","phylogenomics","intensive scoring functions","dedicated computer architecture","phylogenetic maximum likelihood function","statistical models","multicore architecture"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5160929","doi":"10.1109/IPDPS.2009.5160929","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Symposium on Parallel & Distributed Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Symposium on Parallel & Distributed Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5136864/5160846/05160929.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5160846","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IPDPS.2009.5160929","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5160929/","displayDocTitle":"Exploring FPGAs for accelerating the phylogenetic likelihood function","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"23-29 May 2009","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","dateOfInsertion":"10 July 2009","accessionNumber":"10761693","htmlLink":"/document/5160929/","conferenceDate":"23-29 May 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Exploring FPGAs for accelerating the phylogenetic likelihood function","confLoc":"Rome, Italy","sourcePdf":"HiCOMB-1569171213-paper-1.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078536S","chronDate":"23-29 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5136864","isNumber":"5160846","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5136864","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"5160846","articleId":"5160929","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5160931,"authors":[{"name":"Lukasz Ligowski","affiliation":["Interdisciplinary Centre for Mathematical and Computational Modelling, University of Warmia and Mazury, Warsaw, Poland"],"firstName":"Lukasz","lastName":"Ligowski","id":"37572968600"},{"name":"Witold Rudnicki","affiliation":["Interdisciplinary Centre for Mathematical and Computational Modelling, University of Warmia and Mazury, Warsaw, Poland"],"firstName":"Witold","lastName":"Rudnicki","id":"37572968300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3751-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3750-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1530-2075"}],"articleNumber":"5160931","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":83,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":1334},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Databases","Sequences","Bioinformatics","Assembly","Concurrent computing","Computer graphics","Molecular biophysics","Computational modeling","Mathematical model","Programming environments"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bioinformatics","computer graphic equipment","computer graphics","microprocessor chips","parallel processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Smith Waterman algorithm","GPU","CUDA","sequence databases","sequence alignment","bioinformatics","graphical processing unit","desktop computers","Nvidia GPU","ATI Stream Computing environment","massively parallel scanning","programming environment","compute unified device architecture"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["sequence alignment","GPGPU","CUDA","Smith Waterman"]}],"abstract":"The Smith Waterman algorithm for sequence alignment is one of the main tools of bioinformatics.

However, while today's state-of-the-art GPU can easily reduce the execution time of a parallel code by many orders of magnitude, it arguably comes at the expense of significant power and energy consumption. For example, the NVIDIA GTX 280 video card is rated at 236 watts, which is as much as the rest of a compute node, thus requiring a 500-W power supply. As a consequence, the GPU has been viewed as a ldquonon-greenrdquo computing solution. This paper seeks to characterize, and perhaps debunk, the notion of a ldquopower-hungry GPUrdquo via an empirical study of the performance, power, and energy characteristics of GPUs for scientific computing. Specifically, we take an important biological code that runs in a traditional CPU environment and transform and map it to a hybrid CPU+GPU environment. The end result is that our hybrid CPU+GPU environment, hereafter referred to simply as GPU environment, delivers an energy-delay product that is multiple orders of magnitude better than a traditional CPU environment, whether unicore or multicore.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IPDPS.2009.5160980","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5160846","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Symposium on Parallel & Distributed Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5136864/5160846/05160980.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the energy efficiency of graphics processing units for scientific computing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5160980/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-29 May 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5160980/","displayDocTitle":"On the energy efficiency of graphics processing units for scientific computing","conferenceDate":"23-29 May 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10761721","dateOfInsertion":"10 July 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the energy efficiency of graphics processing units for scientific computing","confLoc":"Rome, Italy","sourcePdf":"HPPAC-1569176439-paper-1.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074431S","chronDate":"23-29 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5136864","isNumber":"5160846","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5136864","citationCount":"105","xplore-issue":"5160846","articleId":"5160980","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5160984,"authors":[{"name":"Michael Boyer","affiliation":["Departments of Computer Science, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA, USA"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Boyer","id":"37570053900"},{"name":"David Tarjan","affiliation":["Departments of Computer Science, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA, USA"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Tarjan","id":"37572977500"},{"name":"Scott T.

The inexpensive, single-chip, massively parallel architecture of GPU has evidentially brought factors of speedup to many numerical applications. However, the development of a high-quality GPU application is challenging, due to the large optimization space and complex unpredictable effects of optimizations on GPU program performance. Recently, several studies have attempted to use empirical search to help the optimization. Although those studies have shown promising results, one important factor\u2014program inputs\u2014in the optimization has remained unexplored.

By conducting a series of measurement, we find that the ability to adapt to program inputs is important for some applications to achieve their best performance on GPU. In light of the findings, we develop an input-adaptive optimization framework, namely G-ADAPT, to address the influence by constructing cross-input predictive models for automatically predicting the (near-)optimal configurations for an arbitrary input to a GPU program.

parallel execution framework for Recognition and mining applications","abstract":"Recognition and mining (RM) applications are an emerging class of computing workloads that will be commonly executed on future multi-core and many-core computing platforms. The explosive growth of input data and the use of more sophisticated algorithms in RM applications will ensure, for the foreseeable future, a significant gap between the computational needs of RM applications and the capabilities of rapidly evolving multi- or many-core platforms. To address this gap, we propose a new parallel programming model that inherently embodies the notion of best-effort computing, wherein the underlying parallel computing environment is not expected to be perfect. The proposed best-effort programming model leverages three key characteristics of RM applications: (1) the input data is noisy and it often contains significant redundancy, (2) computations performed on the input data are statistical in nature, and (3) some degree of imprecision in the output is acceptable. As a specific instance of the best-effort parallel programming model, we describe an ldquoiterative-convergencerdquo parallel template, which is used by a significant class of RM applications. We show how best-effort computing can be used to not only reduce computational workload, but to also eliminate dependencies between computations and further increase parallelism. Our experiments on an 8-core machine demonstrate a speed-up of 3.5X and 4.3X for the K-means and GLVQ algorithms, respectively, over a conventional parallel implementation. We also show that there is almost no material impact on the accuracy of results obtained from best-effort implementations in the application context of image segmentation using K-means and eye detection in images using GLVQ.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5160991/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-29 May 2009","publicationDate":"May 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"23-29 May 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5160991/","dateOfInsertion":"10 July 2009","accessionNumber":"10761729","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Best-effort parallel execution framework for Recognition and mining applications","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Best-effort parallel execution framework for Recognition and mining applications","confLoc":"Rome, Italy","sourcePdf":"IPDPS-1569162207-paper-1.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051226S","chronDate":"23-29 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5136864","isNumber":"5160846","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5136864","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"5160846","articleId":"5160991","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":5160995,"authors":[{"name":"Yan Li","affiliation":["IBM China Research Laboratory, China"],"lastName":"Yan Li","id":"37578313100"},{"name":"Li Zhao","affiliation":["Chinese Academy and Sciences, China"],"lastName":"Li Zhao","id":"37578274400"},{"name":"Haibo Lin","affiliation":["IBM China Research Laboratory, China"],"lastName":"Haibo Lin","id":"37577948900"},{"name":"Alex Chunghen Chow","affiliation":["IBM Systems and Technology Group"],"firstName":"Alex Chunghen","lastName":"Chow","id":"37063373400"},{"name":"Jeffrey R.

Its vast application domain makes it an important performance benchmark for new computer architectures. The most common Cooley-Tukey FFT algorithm factorizes a large FFT into a combination of smaller ones. The choice of factors and the order in which they are applied are critical to the ultimate performance of the large FFT. Traditional hand coded FFT libraries can immediately execute a given sized FFT applying constant heuristics to different kernel sizes, but are not always optimal. FFTW is a popular auto tuning FFT library which searches over the possible factorizations and empirically determines one with the best performance. This search method produces FFT kernels for a given size that are competitive with hand tuned libraries. Unfortunately, the search process for a large size takes hours on real hardware, and is completely infeasible to use when evaluating the FFT performance of new hardware which is still in the simulation phase. It is also less than ideal in environments where it is desirable to have a rapid response to a new sized FFT. This paper introduces a novel performance model that allows the FFT performance of a given data size to be estimated to within 2% error without ever running the actual FFT. In addition, by recognizing more sophisticated patterns within the computation, this model reduces the search tree size from a permutation of the number of factors to a combination. Because typical FFT sizes contain a large number of similar factors, this effectively reduces the search by an order of magnitude. When given a set of computational kernels, this model can completely characterize the performance of a chosen target architecture by just running some short performance tests on each sized kernel, a process which takes a few minutes or less. Once characterized, an optimal FFT plan for a given input size can be determined in milliseconds instead of hours. In this paper, we first derive our mathematical model. We then validate its accuracy by using it to improve the performance of a state of the art, hand tuned FFT library by 30%. Finally, we demonstrate its effectiveness by replacing FFTWs own planning stage with our model, resulting in the same FFT performance using FFTWs own kernels in as little as one millionth the computation time.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Symposium on Parallel & Distributed Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5136864/5160846/05160995.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"11","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Symposium on Parallel & Distributed Processing","doi":"10.1109/IPDPS.2009.5160995","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IPDPS.2009.5160995","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5160846","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5160995","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A performance model for Fast Fourier Transform","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fast Fourier transforms","Kernel","Libraries","Computer architecture","Hardware","Computational modeling","Application software","Search methods","Pattern recognition","Testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fast Fourier transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["performance model","fast Fourier transform","computing algorithms","computer architectures","Cooley-Tukey FFT algorithm","hand coded FFT library","auto tuning FFT library","factorizations","FFT kernels","hand tuned library","computational kernels","target architecture"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5160995/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-29 May 2009","displayDocTitle":"A performance model for Fast Fourier Transform","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5160995/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10761732","dateOfInsertion":"10 July 2009","conferenceDate":"23-29 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A performance model for Fast Fourier Transform","confLoc":"Rome, Italy","sourcePdf":"IPDPS-1569162721-paper-1.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.11422S","chronDate":"23-29 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5136864","isNumber":"5160846","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5136864","xplore-issue":"5160846","articleId":"5160995","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5161005,"authors":[{"name":"Nadathur Satish","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences, University of California, Berkeley, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Nadathur","lastName":"Satish","id":"37391797900"},{"name":"Mark Harris","affiliation":["NVIDIA Corporation, Santa Clara, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Mark","lastName":"Harris","id":"37583244400"},{"name":"Michael Garland","affiliation":["NVIDIA Corporation, Santa Clara, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Garland","id":"37272036400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3751-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3750-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1530-2075"}],"articleNumber":"5161005","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":270,"citationCountPatent":5,"totalDownloads":3201},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Designing efficient sorting algorithms for manycore GPUs","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5161005","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Algorithm design and analysis","Sorting","Parallel processing","Computer architecture","Multicore processing","Concurrent computing","Global communication","Parallel architectures","Database systems","Data structures"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["merging","parallel algorithms","parallel architectures","shared memory systems","sorting"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sorting algorithms","manycore GPU","high-performance parallel radix sort routines","high-performance parallel merge sort routines","comparison-based sort","CUDA-based radix sorts","multicore CPU sorting routine","fine-grained parallelism","high-speed onchip shared memory","GPU architecture"]}],"abstract":"We describe the design of high-performance parallel radix sort and merge sort routines for manycore GPUs, taking advantage of the full programmability offered by CUDA.

It is also 23% faster, on average, than even a very carefully optimized multicore CPU sorting routine. To achieve this performance, we carefully design our algorithms to expose substantial fine-grained parallelism and decompose the computation into independent tasks that perform minimal global communication. We exploit the high-speed onchip shared memory provided by NVIDIA's GPU architecture and efficient data-parallel primitives, particularly parallel scan.

Parallel file systems used in this environment are increasingly specialized to extract the highest possible performance for large I/O operations, at the expense of other potential workloads. While some applications have adapted to I/O best practices and can obtain good performance on these systems, the natural I/O patterns of many applications result in generation of many small files. These applications are not well served by current parallel file systems at very large scale. This paper describes five techniques for optimizing small-file access in parallel file systems for very large scale systems. These five techniques are all implemented in a single parallel file system (PVFS) and then systematically assessed on two test platforms. A microbenchmark and the mdtest benchmark are used to evaluate the optimizations at an unprecedented scale. We observe as much as a 905% improvement in small-file create rates, 1,106% improvement in small-file stat rates, and 727% improvement in small-file removal rates, compared to a baseline PVFS configuration on a leadership computing platform using 16,384 cores.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"23-29 May 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5161029/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5161029/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10761754","conferenceDate":"23-29 May 2009","publicationDate":"May 2009","dateOfInsertion":"10 July 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Small-file access in parallel file systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Small-file access in parallel file systems","confLoc":"Rome, Italy","sourcePdf":"IPDPS-1569163295-paper-1.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.079173S","chronDate":"23-29 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5136864","isNumber":"5160846","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5136864","citationCount":"68","xplore-issue":"5160846","articleId":"5161029","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5161031,"authors":[{"name":"Matthias Christen","affiliation":["High Performance and Web Computing Group, Computer Science Department, University of Basel, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Matthias","lastName":"Christen","id":"37572491100"},{"name":"Olaf Schenk","affiliation":["High Performance and Web Computing Group, Computer Science Department, University of Basel, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Olaf","lastName":"Schenk","id":"37572652700"},{"name":"Esra Neufeld","affiliation":["ITIS Foundation, ETH Zurich, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Esra","lastName":"Neufeld","id":"37535458200"},{"name":"Peter Messmer","affiliation":["Tech-X Corporation, Boulder, CO, USA"],"firstName":"Peter","lastName":"Messmer","id":"37574577200"},{"name":"Helmar Burkhart","affiliation":["High Performance and Web Computing Group, Computer Science Department, University of Basel, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Helmar","lastName":"Burkhart","id":"37389471800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3751-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3750-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1530-2075"}],"articleNumber":"5161031","dbTime":"26 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":15,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":141},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Concurrent computing","Biomedical computing","Computational modeling","Central Processing Unit","Engines","Computer architecture","Graphics","Context modeling","Arithmetic","Hardware"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["coprocessors","digital simulation","medical computing","multiprocessing systems","parallel processing","performance evaluation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["parallel data-locality","stencil computations","modern microarchitectures","Cell Broadband Engine Architecture","graphics processing units","biomedical simulation","performance benchmarks"]}],"abstract":"Novel micro-architectures including the Cell Broadband Engine Architecture and graphics processing units are attractive platforms for compute-intensive simulations.

Checkpointing and restart is demonstrated for a wide range of over 20 well known applications, including MATLAB, Python, TightVNC, MPICH2, OpenMPI, and runCMS. RunCMS runs as a 680 MB image in memory that includes 540 dynamic libraries, and is used for the CMS experiment of the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. DMTCP transparently checkpoints general cluster computations consisting of many nodes, processes, and threads; as well as typical desktop applications. On 128 distributed cores (32 nodes), checkpoint and restart times are typically 2 seconds, with negligible run-time overhead. Typical checkpoint times are reduced to 0.2 seconds when using forked checkpointing. Experimental results show that checkpoint time remains nearly constant as the number of nodes increases on a medium-size cluster. DMTCP automatically accounts for fork, exec, ssh, mutexes/ semaphores, TCP/IP sockets, UNIX domain sockets, pipes, ptys (pseudo-terminals), terminal modes, ownership of controlling terminals, signal handlers, open file descriptors, shared open file descriptors, I/O (including the readline library), shared memory (via mmap), parent-child process relationships, pid virtualization, and other operating system artifacts. By emphasizing an unprivileged, user-space approach, compatibility is maintained across Linux kernels from 2.6.9 through the current 2.6.28. Since DMTCP is unprivileged and does not require special kernel modules or kernel patches, DMTCP can be incorporated and distributed as a checkpoint-restart module within some larger package.","doi":"10.1109/IPDPS.2009.5161063","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Symposium on Parallel & Distributed Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Symposium on Parallel & Distributed Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5136864/5160846/05161063.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IPDPS.2009.5161063","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5160846","startPage":"1","endPage":"12","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"DMTCP: Transparent checkpointing for cluster computations and the desktop","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5161063","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"DMTCP: Transparent checkpointing for cluster computations and the desktop","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-29 May 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5161063/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"23-29 May 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10761779","dateOfInsertion":"10 July 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5161063/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"DMTCP: Transparent checkpointing for cluster computations and the desktop","confLoc":"Rome, Italy","sourcePdf":"IPDPS-1569163631-paper-1.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065852S","chronDate":"23-29 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5136864","isNumber":"5160846","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5136864","citationCount":"128","xplore-issue":"5160846","articleId":"5161063","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-29"},{"_id":5161065,"authors":[{"name":"Jeff A.

As a case study, we design and implement the ldquoDCGNrdquo API on NVIDIA GPUs that is similar to MPI and allows full access to the underlying architecture. We introduce the notion of data-parallel thread-groups as a way to map resources to MPI ranks. We use a method that also allows the data-parallel processors to run autonomously from user-written CPU code. In order to facilitate communication, we use a sleep-based polling system to store and retrieve messages. Unlike previous systems, our method provides both performance and flexibility. By running a test suite of applications with different communication requirements, we find that a tolerable amount of overhead is incurred, somewhere between one and five percent depending on the application, and indicate the locations where this overhead accumulates. We conclude that with innovations in chipsets and drivers, this overhead will be mitigated and provide similar performance to typical CPU-based MPI implementations while providing fully-dynamic communication.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Message passing on data-parallel architectures","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Symposium on Parallel & Distributed Processing","doi":"10.1109/IPDPS.2009.5161065","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Symposium on Parallel & Distributed Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5136864/5160846/05161065.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"12","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IPDPS.2009.5161065","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5160846","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5161065","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5161065/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-29 May 2009","displayDocTitle":"Message passing on data-parallel architectures","conferenceDate":"23-29 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5161065/","dateOfInsertion":"10 July 2009","publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10761781","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Message passing on data-parallel architectures","confLoc":"Rome, Italy","sourcePdf":"IPDPS-1569163669-paper-1.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062762S","chronDate":"23-29 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5136864","isNumber":"5160846","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5136864","citationCount":"40","xplore-issue":"5160846","articleId":"5161065","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5161066,"authors":[{"name":"Gregory M.

There are several approaches for such analysis, each varying in accuracy and computational complexity. Smith-Waterman (SW) is by far the best algorithm for its accuracy in similarity scoring. However, execution time of this algorithm on general purpose processor based systems makes it impractical for use by life scientists. In this paper we take Smith-Waterman as a case study to explore the architectural features of Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) and evaluate the challenges the hardware architecture poses, as well as the software modifications needed to map the program architecture on to the GPU. We achieve a 23x speedup against the serial version of the SW algorithm. We further study the effect of memory organization and the instruction set architecture on GPU performance. For that purpose we analyze another implementation on an Intel Quad Core processor that makes use of Intel's SIMD based SSE2 architecture. We show that if reading blocks of 16 words at a time instead of 4 is allowed, and if 64 KB of shared memory as opposed to 16 KB is available to the programmer, GPU performance enhances significantly making it comparable to the SIMD based implementation. We quantify these observations to illustrate the need for studies on extending the instruction set and memory organization for the GPU.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IPDPS.2009.5161066","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5160846","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Symposium on Parallel & Distributed Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Symposium on Parallel & Distributed Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5136864/5160846/05161066.pdf","endPage":"10","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sequence alignment with GPU: Performance and design challenges","doi":"10.1109/IPDPS.2009.5161066","startPage":"1","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5161066","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-29 May 2009","displayDocTitle":"Sequence alignment with GPU: Performance and design challenges","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5161066/","dateOfInsertion":"10 July 2009","accessionNumber":"10750289","publicationDate":"May 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5161066/","conferenceDate":"23-29 May 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sequence alignment with GPU: Performance and design challenges","confLoc":"Rome, Italy","sourcePdf":"IPDPS-1569163673-paper-1.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057332S","chronDate":"23-29 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5136864","isNumber":"5160846","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5136864","citationCount":"39","xplore-issue":"5160846","articleId":"5161066","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5161067,"authors":[{"name":"Madhukar Korupolu","affiliation":["IBM Almaden Research Center, USA"],"firstName":"Madhukar","lastName":"Korupolu","id":"37332881900"},{"name":"Aameek Singh","affiliation":["IBM Almaden Research Center, USA"],"firstName":"Aameek","lastName":"Singh","id":"37419541900"},{"name":"Bhuvan Bamba","affiliation":["Georgia Tech, USA"],"firstName":"Bhuvan","lastName":"Bamba","id":"37428681100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3751-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3750-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1530-2075"}],"articleNumber":"5161067","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":46,"citationCountPatent":7,"totalDownloads":881},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computer applications","Linear programming","Application virtualization","Resource virtualization","Packaging","Voice mail","Hardware","Throughput","Storage automation","Topology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer centres","linear programming","virtual storage"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["modern data centers","coupled placement problem","virtualization technologies","multipurpose hardware devices","worst-case approximation","linear programming based methods","interactive analysis","CPA"]}],"abstract":"We introduce the coupled placement problem for modern data centers spanning placement of application computation and data among available server and storage resources. While the two have traditionally been addressed independently in data centers, two modern trends make it beneficial to consider them together in a coupled manner: (a) rise in virtualization technologies, which enable applications packaged as VMs to be run on any server in the data center with spare compute resources, and (b) rise in multi-purpose hardware devices in the data center which provide compute resources of varying capabilities at different proximities from the storage nodes. We present a novel framework called CPA for addressing such coupled placement of application data and computation in modern data centers. Based on two well-studied problems - Stable Marriage and Knapsacks - the CPA framework is simple, fast, versatile and automatically enables high throughput applications to be placed on nearby server and storage node pairs. While a theoretical proof of CPA's worst-case approximation guarantee remains an open question, we use extensive experimental analysis to evaluate CPA on large synthetic data centers comparing it to Linear Programming based methods and other traditional methods. Experiments show that CPA is consistently and surprisingly within 0 to 4% of the Linear Programming based optimal values for various data center topologies and workload patterns. At the same time it is one to two orders of magnitude faster than the LP based methods and is able to scale to much larger problem sizes. The fast running time of CPA makes it highly suitable for large data center environments where hundreds to thousands of server and storage nodes are common. LP based approaches are prohibitively slow in such environments. CPA is also suitable for fast interactive analysis during consolidation of such environments from physical to virtual resources.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Coupled placement in modern data centers","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Symposium on Parallel & Distributed Processing","doi":"10.1109/IPDPS.2009.5161067","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Symposium on Parallel & Distributed Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5136864/5160846/05161067.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"12","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IPDPS.2009.5161067","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5160846","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5161067","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5161067/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-29 May 2009","displayDocTitle":"Coupled placement in modern data centers","conferenceDate":"23-29 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5161067/","dateOfInsertion":"10 July 2009","publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10761782","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Coupled placement in modern data centers","confLoc":"Rome, Italy","sourcePdf":"IPDPS-1569163675-paper-1.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.133552S","chronDate":"23-29 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5136864","isNumber":"5160846","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5136864","citationCount":"46","xplore-issue":"5160846","articleId":"5161067","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5161068,"authors":[{"name":"Dana Schaa","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Northeastern University, USA"],"firstName":"Dana","lastName":"Schaa","id":"37396065700"},{"name":"David Kaeli","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Northeastern University, USA"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Kaeli","id":"37271686900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3751-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3750-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1530-2075"}],"articleNumber":"5161068","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":57,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":723},"abstract":"Graphics processing units (GPUs) have been growing in popularity due to their impressive processing capabilities, and with general purpose programming languages such as NVIDIA's CUDA interface, are becoming the platform of choice in the scientific computing community. Previous studies that used GPUs focused on obtaining significant performance gains from execution on a single GPU. These studies employed low-level, architecture-specific tuning in order to achieve sizeable benefits over multicore CPU execution. In this paper, we consider the benefits of running on multiple (parallel) GPUs to provide further orders of performance speedup. Our methodology allows developers to accurately predict execution time for GPU applications while varying the number and configuration of the GPUs, and the size of the input data set. This is a natural next step in GPU computing because it allows researchers to determine the most appropriate GPU configuration for an application without having to purchase hardware, or write the code for a multiple-GPU implementation. When used to predict performance on six scientific applications, our framework produces accurate performance estimates (11% difference on average and 40% maximum difference in a single case) for a range of short and long running scientific programs.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Symposium on Parallel & Distributed Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5136864/5160846/05161068.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"12","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Symposium on Parallel & Distributed Processing","doi":"10.1109/IPDPS.2009.5161068","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IPDPS.2009.5161068","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5160846","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5161068","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Exploring the multiple-GPU design space","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hardware","Scientific computing","Performance gain","Libraries","Application software","Computer graphics","Computer languages","Multicore processing","Central Processing Unit","Programming profession"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["coprocessors","multiprocessing systems","natural sciences computing","parallel architectures"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiple-graphics processing units design space","general purpose programming languages","NVIDIA","CUDA interface","scientific computing community","architecture-specific tuning","parallel graphics processing units"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5161068/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-29 May 2009","displayDocTitle":"Exploring the multiple-GPU design space","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5161068/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10750290","dateOfInsertion":"10 July 2009","conferenceDate":"23-29 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Exploring the multiple-GPU design space","confLoc":"Rome, Italy","sourcePdf":"IPDPS-1569163687-paper-1.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071331S","chronDate":"23-29 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5136864","isNumber":"5160846","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5136864","citationCount":"57","xplore-issue":"5160846","articleId":"5161068","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5161070,"authors":[{"name":"Xuechen Zhang","affiliation":["ECE Department, Wayne State University, Detroit, MI, USA"],"firstName":"Xuechen","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37405064800"},{"name":"Song Jiang","affiliation":["ECE Department, Wayne State University, Detroit, MI, USA"],"firstName":"Song","lastName":"Jiang","id":"37279383900"},{"name":"Kei Davis","affiliation":["Computer and Computational Sciences, Los Alamos National Laboratory, Los Alamos, NM, USA"],"firstName":"Kei","lastName":"Davis","id":"37282656500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3751-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3750-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1530-2075"}],"articleNumber":"5161070","dbTime":"16 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":24,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":150},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resonance","File systems","Throughput","Concurrent computing","High performance computing","Laboratories","Parallel processing","Degradation","Pattern matching","File servers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["client-server systems","data handling","input-output programs","parallel programming","pattern recognition","software portability","storage management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high-performance implementation","collective I/O","parallel file systems","parallel computing","client-based scheme","server-based scheme","MPIIO software","storage system configuration","portability","request pattern","data striping pattern"]}],"abstract":"Collective I/O is a widely used technique to improve I/O performance in parallel computing. It can be implemented as a client-based or as a server-based scheme. The client-based implementation is more widely adopted in the MPIIO software such as ROMIO because of its independence from the storage system configuration and its greater portability. However, existing implementations of client-side collective I/O do not consider the actual pattern of file striping over multiple I/O nodes in the storage system. This can cause a large number of requests for non-sequential data at I/O nodes, substantially degrading I/O performance. Investigating a surprisingly high I/O throughput achieved when there is an accidental match between a particular request pattern and the data striping pattern on the I/O nodes, we reveal the resonance phenomenon as the cause. Exploiting readily available information on data striping from the metadata server in popular file systems such as PVFS2 and Lustre, we design a new collective I/O implementation technique, named as resonant I/O, that makes resonance a common case. Resonant I/O rearranges requests from multiple MPI processes according to the presumed data layout on the disks of I/O nodes so that non-sequential access of disk data can be turned into sequential access, significantly improving I/O performance without compromising the independence of a client-based implementation. We have implemented our design in ROMIO. Our experimental results on a small- and medium-scale cluster show that the scheme can increase I/O throughput for some commonly used parallel I/O benchmarks such as mpi-io-test and ior-mpi-io over the existing implementation of ROMIO by up to 157%, with no scenario demonstrating significantly decreased performance.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Making resonance a common case: A high-performance implementation of collective I/O on parallel file systems","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Symposium on Parallel & Distributed Processing","doi":"10.1109/IPDPS.2009.5161070","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Symposium on Parallel & Distributed Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5136864/5160846/05161070.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"12","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IPDPS.2009.5161070","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5160846","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5161070","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5161070/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-29 May 2009","displayDocTitle":"Making resonance a common case: A high-performance implementation of collective I/O on parallel file systems","conferenceDate":"23-29 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5161070/","dateOfInsertion":"10 July 2009","publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10750292","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Making resonance a common case: A high-performance implementation of collective I/O on parallel file systems","confLoc":"Rome, Italy","sourcePdf":"IPDPS-1569163691-paper-1.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.088067S","chronDate":"23-29 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5136864","isNumber":"5160846","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5136864","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"5160846","articleId":"5161070","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":5161073,"authors":[{"name":"John Paul Walters","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, State University of New York, University at Buffalo, Buffalo, NY, USA"],"firstName":"John Paul","lastName":"Walters","id":"37574444600"},{"name":"Vidyananth Balu","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, State University of New York, University at Buffalo, Buffalo, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Vidyananth","lastName":"Balu","id":"37579482200"},{"name":"Suryaprakash Kompalli","affiliation":["Hewlett Packard Laboratories, Bangalore, India"],"firstName":"Suryaprakash","lastName":"Kompalli","id":"37584272800"},{"name":"Vipin Chaudhary","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, State University of New York, University at Buffalo, Buffalo, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Vipin","lastName":"Chaudhary","id":"37270863200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3751-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3750-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1530-2075"}],"articleNumber":"5161073","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":25,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":266},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Liver","Image segmentation","Hidden Markov models","Image databases","Kernel","Viterbi algorithm","Programming environments","Testing","Frequency","Random access memory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital signal processing chips","DRAM chips","image segmentation","Markov processes","medical image processing","parallel processing","query processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["liver image segmentation","Markov random fields","Viterbi algorithm","NVIDIA 8800 GTX","GPU kernels","DRAM","graphics processing units","HMMER database searches","CUDA programming environment"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5161073","doi":"10.1109/IPDPS.2009.5161073","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Symposium on Parallel & Distributed Processing","abstract":"In this paper we present the results of parallelizing two life sciences applications, Markov random fields-based (MRF) liver segmentation and HMMER's Viterbi algorithm, using GPUs.

We show that the differences in speedup between MRF and hmmsearch is due primarily to the frequency at which the hmmsearch must read from the GPU's DRAM.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IPDPS.2009.5161073","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5160846","startPage":"1","endPage":"12","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Symposium on Parallel & Distributed Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5136864/5160846/05161073.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Evaluating the use of GPUs in liver image segmentation and HMMER database searches","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5161073/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-29 May 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5161073/","displayDocTitle":"Evaluating the use of GPUs in liver image segmentation and HMMER database searches","conferenceDate":"23-29 May 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10761783","dateOfInsertion":"10 July 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Evaluating the use of GPUs in liver image segmentation and HMMER database searches","confLoc":"Rome, Italy","sourcePdf":"IPDPS-1569163707-paper-1.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078751S","chronDate":"23-29 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5136864","isNumber":"5160846","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5136864","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"5160846","articleId":"5161073","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5161100,"authors":[{"name":"Kamesh Madduri","affiliation":["Computational Research Division, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Kamesh","lastName":"Madduri","id":"37268662700"},{"name":"David Ediger","affiliation":["College of Computing, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Ediger","id":"37393028100"},{"name":"Karl Jiang","affiliation":["College of Computing, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Karl","lastName":"Jiang","id":"37410885700"},{"name":"David A.

Betweenness centrality is a key kernel in analyzing the importance of vertices (or edges) in applications ranging from social networks, to power grids, to the influence of jazz musicians, and is also incorporated into the DARPA HPCS SSCA#2, a benchmark extensively used to evaluate the performance of emerging high-performance computing architectures for graph analytics. We design an optimized implementation of betweenness centrality for the massively multithreaded Cray XMT system with the Thread-storm processor. For a small-world network of 268 million vertices and 2.147 billion edges, the 16-processor XMT system achieves a TEPS rate (an algorithmic performance count for the number of edges traversed per second) of 160 million per second, which corresponds to more than a 2times performance improvement over the previous parallel implementation. We demonstrate the applicability of our implementation to analyze massive real-world datasets by computing approximate betweenness centrality for the large IMDb movie-actor network.","doi":"10.1109/IPDPS.2009.5161100","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Symposium on Parallel & Distributed Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Symposium on Parallel & Distributed Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5136864/5160846/05161100.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IPDPS.2009.5161100","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5160846","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A faster parallel algorithm and efficient multithreaded implementations for evaluating betweenness centrality on massive datasets","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5161100","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A faster parallel algorithm and efficient multithreaded implementations for evaluating betweenness centrality on massive datasets","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-29 May 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5161100/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"23-29 May 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10761798","dateOfInsertion":"10 July 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5161100/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A faster parallel algorithm and efficient multithreaded implementations for evaluating betweenness centrality on massive datasets","confLoc":"Rome, Italy","sourcePdf":"MTAAP-1569176248-paper-1.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044655S","chronDate":"23-29 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5136864","isNumber":"5160846","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5136864","citationCount":"54","xplore-issue":"5160846","articleId":"5161100","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5161113,"authors":[{"name":"Azzedine Boukerche","affiliation":["School of Information Technology and Engineering (SITE), University of Ottawa, Canada"],"firstName":"Azzedine","lastName":"Boukerche","id":"37279514400"},{"name":"Rodolfo Bezerra Batista","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Brasilia, Brazil"],"firstName":"Rodolfo Bezerra","lastName":"Batista","id":"37283409300"},{"name":"Alba Cristina Magalhaes Alves de Melo","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Brasilia, Brazil","School of Information Technology and Engineering (SITE), University of Ottawa, Canada"],"firstName":"Alba Cristina Magalhaes Alves","lastName":"de Melo","id":"37283407800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3751-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3750-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1530-2075"}],"articleNumber":"5161113","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":129},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Genomics","Bioinformatics","Sequences","Biological system modeling","Pattern matching","Dynamic programming","Organisms","Databases","Biology","Information technology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bioinformatics","computational complexity","genomics","parallel algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["pairwise megabase genome biological sequence alignment","bioinformatics","quadratic time complexity","heuristic method","BLAST","z-align parallel strategy","user-restricted memory space"]}],"abstract":"Pairwise sequence alignment is a basic operation in bioinformatics that is performed thousands of times, in a daily basis. The exact methods proposed in the literature have quadratic time complexity. For this reason, heuristic methods such as BLAST are widely used. Nevertheless, it is known that exact methods present better sensitivity, leading to better results. To obtain exact results faster, many parallel strategies have been proposed but most of them fail to align huge biological sequences. This happens because not only the quadratic time must be considered but also the space should be reduced. In this paper, we evaluate the performance and sensibility of z-align, a parallel exact strategy that runs in user-restricted memory space. The results obtained in a 64-processor cluster show that two sequences of size 23MBP (Mega Base Pairs) and 24MBP, respectively, were successfully aligned with z-align. Also, in order to align two 3MBP sequences, a speedup of 34.35 was achieved. Finally, when comparing z-align with BLAST, we can see that the z-align alignments are longer and have a higher score.","doi":"10.1109/IPDPS.2009.5161113","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Symposium on Parallel & Distributed Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Symposium on Parallel & Distributed Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5136864/5160846/05161113.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IPDPS.2009.5161113","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5160846","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Exact pairwise alignment of megabase genome biological sequences using a novel z-align parallel strategy","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5161113","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Exact pairwise alignment of megabase genome biological sequences using a novel z-align parallel strategy","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-29 May 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5161113/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"23-29 May 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10761807","dateOfInsertion":"10 July 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5161113/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Exact pairwise alignment of megabase genome biological sequences using a novel z-align parallel strategy","confLoc":"Rome, Italy","sourcePdf":"NIDISC-130-paper-1.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.112373S","chronDate":"23-29 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5136864","isNumber":"5160846","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5136864","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"5160846","articleId":"5161113","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5161115,"authors":[{"name":"Gerhard Weis","affiliation":["Institute for Integrated and Intelligent Systems, Griffith University, QLD, Australia"],"firstName":"Gerhard","lastName":"Weis","id":"37572712100"},{"name":"Andrew Lewis","affiliation":["Institute for Integrated and Intelligent Systems, Griffith University, QLD, Australia"],"firstName":"Andrew","lastName":"Lewis","id":"37265628100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3751-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3750-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1530-2075"}],"articleNumber":"5161115","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":214},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Grid computing","Ant colony optimization","Peer to peer computing","Network servers","Radiofrequency identification","Dipole antennas","XML","Protocols","Resonant frequency","Computational modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ad hoc networks","antennas","electronic messaging","grid computing","optimisation","protocols","radiofrequency identification","XML"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["XMPP","ad-hoc grid computing","parallel ant colony optimisation","XML messaging and presence protocol","Jabber","instant messaging protocol","XML streams","computing resources","NEC-tool","RFID antennas"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5161115","abstract":"XMPP (XML Messaging and Presence Protocol), also known as Jabber, is a popular instant messaging protocol that uses XML streams for communication.

This observation may have particular significance for design of some forms of distributed PSO algorithms.","doi":"10.1109/IPDPS.2009.5161125","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Symposium on Parallel & Distributed Processing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IPDPS.2009.5161125","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5160846","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Symposium on Parallel & Distributed Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5136864/5160846/05161125.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The effect of population density on the performance of a spatial social network algorithm for multi-objective optimisation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5161125/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"The effect of population density on the performance of a spatial social network algorithm for multi-objective optimisation","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5161125/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10750313","publicationDate":"May 2009","dateOfInsertion":"10 July 2009","conferenceDate":"23-29 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-29 May 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The effect of population density on the performance of a spatial social network algorithm for multi-objective optimisation","confLoc":"Rome, Italy","sourcePdf":"NIDISC-143-paper-1.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.083713S","chronDate":"23-29 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5136864","isNumber":"5160846","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5136864","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5160846","articleId":"5161125","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5161126,"authors":[{"name":"Lakhdar Loukil","affiliation":["Facult\u00e9 des Sciences D\u00e9partement dinformatique, Universit\u00e9 d'Oran, Algeria"],"firstName":"Lakhdar","lastName":"Loukil","id":"37572658800"},{"name":"Malika Mehdi","affiliation":["Faculty of Sciences Technology and Communication, University of Luxembourg, Luxembourg"],"firstName":"Malika","lastName":"Mehdi","id":"37579859100"},{"name":"Nouredine Melab","affiliation":["INRIA Futurs, Parc Scientifique de la Haute Borne, Villeneuve d'Ascq, France"],"firstName":"Nouredine","lastName":"Melab","id":"37297112700"},{"name":"El-Ghazali Talbi","affiliation":["INRIA Futurs, Parc Scientifique de la Haute Borne, Villeneuve d'Ascq, France"],"firstName":"El-Ghazali","lastName":"Talbi","id":"37276569800"},{"name":"Pascal Bouvry","affiliation":["Faculty of Sciences Technology and Communication, University of Luxembourg, Luxembourg"],"firstName":"Pascal","lastName":"Bouvry","id":"37282633800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3751-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3750-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1530-2075"}],"articleNumber":"5161126","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":139},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5161126","abstract":"In this paper we propose a parallel hybrid genetic method for solving Quadratic 3-dimensional Assignment Problem (Q3AP). This problem is proved to be computationally NP-hard. The parallelism in our algorithm is of two hierarchical levels. The first level is an insular model where a number of GAs (genetic algorithms) evolve in parallel. The second level is a parallel transformation of individuals in each GA. Implementation has been done using ParadisEO1 framework, and the experiments have been performed on GRID5000, the French nation-wide computational grid. To evaluate our method, we used three benchmarks derived from QAP instances of QAPLIB and the results are compared with those reported in the literature. The preliminary results show that the method is promising. The obtained solutions are close to the optimal values and the execution is efficient.","doi":"10.1109/IPDPS.2009.5161126","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Symposium on Parallel & Distributed Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5136864/5160846/05161126.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Symposium on Parallel & Distributed Processing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IPDPS.2009.5161126","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5160846","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A parallel hybrid genetic algorithm-simulated annealing for solving Q3AP on computational grid","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Annealing","Concurrent computing","Grid computing","Genetic algorithms","Protocols","Diversity reception","Space exploration","Automatic repeat request","Parallel processing","Hybrid power systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","grid computing","parallel algorithms","simulated annealing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["parallel hybrid genetic algorithm-simulated annealing","Q3AP","computational grid","parallel hybrid genetic method","quadratic 3D assignment problem","insular model","parallel transformation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Quadratic 3-dimensional Assignment Problem","Meta-heuristics","Insular Model","Hybridization","Parallel Genetic Algorithms","Grid Computing"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5161126/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-29 May 2009","displayDocTitle":"A parallel hybrid genetic algorithm-simulated annealing for solving Q3AP on computational grid","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5161126/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","dateOfInsertion":"10 July 2009","conferenceDate":"23-29 May 2009","accessionNumber":"10750314","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A parallel hybrid genetic algorithm-simulated annealing for solving Q3AP on computational grid","confLoc":"Rome, Italy","sourcePdf":"NIDISC-144-paper-1.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.079144S","chronDate":"23-29 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5136864","isNumber":"5160846","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5136864","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"5160846","articleId":"5161126","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5161133,"authors":[{"name":"Majd Kokaly","affiliation":["Department of Computing and Software, McMaster University, Hamilton, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Majd","lastName":"Kokaly","id":"38275737400"},{"name":"Issam Al-Azzoni","affiliation":["Department of Computing and Software, McMaster University, Hamilton, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Issam","lastName":"Al-Azzoni","id":"38270278800"},{"name":"Douglas G.

This library is written on top of HeteroMPI and ScaLAPACK whose building blocks, the de facto standard kernels for matrix and vector operations (BLAS and its parallel counterpart PBLAS) and message passing communication (BLACS), are optimized for heterogeneous computational clusters. We show that the efficiency of these parallel routines is due to the most important feature of the library, which is the automation of the difficult optimization tasks of parallel programming on heterogeneous computing clusters. They are the determination of the accurate values of the platform parameters such as the speeds of the processors and the latencies and bandwidths of the communication links connecting different pairs of processors, the optimal values of the algorithmic parameters such as the total number of processes, the 2D process grid arrangement and the efficient mapping of the processes executing the parallel algorithm to the executing nodes of the heterogeneous computing cluster. We describe this process of automation followed by presentation of experimental results on a local heterogeneous computing cluster demonstrating the efficiency of these solvers.","doi":"10.1109/IPDPS.2009.5161163","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Symposium on Parallel & Distributed Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Symposium on Parallel & Distributed Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5136864/5160846/05161163.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IPDPS.2009.5161163","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5160846","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Parallel solvers for dense linear systems for heterogeneous computational clusters","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5161163","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Parallel solvers for dense linear systems for heterogeneous computational clusters","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-29 May 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5161163/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"23-29 May 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10750328","dateOfInsertion":"10 July 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5161163/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Parallel solvers for dense linear systems for heterogeneous computational clusters","confLoc":"Rome, Italy","sourcePdf":"PDSEC-15-paper-1.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.096966S","chronDate":"23-29 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5136864","isNumber":"5160846","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5136864","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5160846","articleId":"5161163","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5161200,"authors":[{"name":"Nupur Lodha","affiliation":["Dhirubhai Ambani Institute of Information and Communication Technology, Gandhinagar, India"],"firstName":"Nupur","lastName":"Lodha","id":"37572572600"},{"name":"Nivesh Rai","affiliation":["Dhirubhai Ambani Institute of Information and Communication Technology, Gandhinagar, India"],"firstName":"Nivesh","lastName":"Rai","id":"37574124500"},{"name":"Aarthy Krishnamurthy","affiliation":["Performance Engineering Laboratory, School of Electronic Engineering, University of Dublin, Ireland"],"firstName":"Aarthy","lastName":"Krishnamurthy","id":"37572152700"},{"name":"Hrishikesh Venkataraman","affiliation":["Performance Engineering Laboratory, School of Electronic Engineering, University of Dublin, Ireland","Dhirubhai Ambani Institute of Information and Communication Technology, Gandhinagar, India"],"firstName":"Hrishikesh","lastName":"Venkataraman","id":"37293983300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3751-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3750-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1530-2075"}],"articleNumber":"5161200","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":374},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5161200","abstract":"Notice of Violation of IEEE Publication Principles<br><br>\"Efficient Implementation of QRD-RLS Algorithm using Hardware-Software Co-design\"<br> by Napur Lodha, Nivesh Rai, Aarthy Krishnamurthy, Hrishikesh Venkataraman<br> in the 2009 IEEE International Symposium on Parallel & Distributed Processing (IPDPS 2009), 2009, pp. 1 - 4.<br><br> After careful and considered review of the content and authorship of this paper by a duly constituted expert committee, this paper has been found to be in violation of IEEE's Publication Principles. <br><br> This paper contains significant portions of original text from the paper cited below.

The aim is to create a homogeneous array of RTR regions on a FPGA, which can be reconfigured on demand during run-time. We study its setup, implementation and performance in comparison with its static counterpart. Such a grid of partially reconfigurable regions (PRR) on a FPGA could be used as an accelerator for computers to offload compute kernels or as an enhancement of functionality in the embedded market which uses FPGAs. An in-depth look at the methodology of creating run-time reconfigurable modules and its tools is shown. Due to the lack of the tools in handling hundreds of dynamically reconfigurable regions a framework is presented which supports the user in the creation process of the design. A case study which uses state of the art Xilinx Virtex-5 FPGAs compares the run-time reconfigurable implementation and achievable clock speeds of a grid with up to 47 reconfigurable module regions with its static counterpart. For this examination a high performance module is used, which finds patterns in a bit stream (pattern matcher). This module is replicated for each partially reconfigurable region. Particularly, design considerations for the controller, which manages the modules, are introduced. Beyond this, the paper also addresses further challenges of the implementation of such a RTR grid and limitations of the reconfigurability of Xilinx FPGAs.","doi":"10.1109/IPDPS.2009.5161221","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Symposium on Parallel & Distributed Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Symposium on Parallel & Distributed Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5136864/5160846/05161221.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IPDPS.2009.5161221","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5160846","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5161221","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Impact of run-time reconfiguration on design and speed - A case study based on a grid of run-time reconfigurable modules inside a FPGA","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-29 May 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5161221/","displayDocTitle":"Impact of run-time reconfiguration on design and speed - A case study based on a grid of run-time reconfigurable modules inside a FPGA","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5161221/","publicationDate":"May 2009","dateOfInsertion":"10 July 2009","conferenceDate":"23-29 May 2009","accessionNumber":"10750359","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Impact of run-time reconfiguration on design and speed - A case study based on a grid of run-time reconfigurable modules inside a FPGA","confLoc":"Rome, Italy","sourcePdf":"RAW-1569167871-paper-1.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.081464S","chronDate":"23-29 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5136864","isNumber":"5160846","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5136864","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5160846","articleId":"5161221","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5161242,"authors":[{"name":"Andrea Di Biagio","affiliation":["Politecnico di Milano, Italy"],"firstName":"Andrea Di","lastName":"Biagio","id":"37572636600"},{"name":"Alessandro Barenghi","affiliation":["Politecnico di Milano, Italy"],"firstName":"Alessandro","lastName":"Barenghi","id":"37399435500"},{"name":"Giovanni Agosta","affiliation":["Politecnico di Milano, Italy"],"firstName":"Giovanni","lastName":"Agosta","id":"37282684300"},{"name":"Gerardo Pelosi","affiliation":["Universit\u00e0 degli Studi di Bergamo, Italy"],"firstName":"Gerardo","lastName":"Pelosi","id":"37292885200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3751-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3750-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1530-2075"}],"articleNumber":"5161242","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":58,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":951},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Graphics","Hardware","Cryptography","Parallel processing","Costs","Throughput","Parallel programming","Web server","Concurrent computing","Multicore processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer graphic equipment","coprocessors","cryptography","multiprocessing systems","parallel processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["parallel AES","graphics hardware","CUDA framework","Web server","encrypted data transfer","multicore processor","AES-CTR symmetric cryptographic primitive","CPU-based OpenSSL","programming knowledge","hardware resource","Advanced Encryption Standard","compute unified device architecture","coprocessor"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5161242","abstract":"Web servers often need to manage encrypted transfers of data.

Ontology defines a set of representational primitives with which a domain of knowledge is modeled. The main purpose of the semantic Web and ontology is to integrate heterogeneous data and enable interoperability among disparate systems. Ontology has been used to model software engineering knowledge by denoting the artifacts that are designed or produced during the engineering process.

Accidental and malicious activities such as misconfigurations, failures, and worm attacks can induce severe BGP instabilities leading to data loss, extensive delays, and loss of connectivity. In this work, we propose an online instability detection architecture that can be implemented by individual routers. We use statistical pattern recognition techniques for detecting the instabilities, and the algorithm is evaluated using real Internet data for a diverse set of events including misconfiguration, node failures, and several worm attacks. The proposed scheme is based on adaptive segmentation of feature traces extracted from BGP update messages and exploiting the temporal and spatial correlations in the traces for robust detection of the instability events. Furthermore, we use route change information to pinpoint the culprit ASes where the instabilities have originated.","doi":"10.1109/TC.2009.91","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/12/5271543/05161252.pdf","startPage":"1470","endPage":"1484","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.2009.91","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5271543","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Online Mechanism for BGP Instability Detection and Analysis","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5161252","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 July 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5161252/","displayDocTitle":"An Online Mechanism for BGP Instability Detection and Analysis","volume":"58","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","accessionNumber":"10892966","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5161252/","dateOfInsertion":"29 September 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Online Mechanism for BGP Instability Detection and Analysis","sourcePdf":"ttc2009111470.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.103707S","chronDate":"Nov.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"12","isNumber":"5271543","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"42","xplore-issue":"5271543","articleId":"5161252","onlineDate":"10 July 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":5161253,"authors":[{"name":"Kiran Puttaswamy","affiliation":["Intel Corporation, Austin, TX, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/12/5226180/5161253/5161253-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Kiran Puttaswamy received the MS and PhD degrees from the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta, in 2004 and 2007, respectively.

The die-to-die vias that comprise this interface can be treated as regular on-chip metal due to their small size (on the order of 1 mum) and high speed (sub-FO4 die-to-die communication delay). The increased device density and the ability to place and route in the third dimension provide new opportunities for microarchitecture design. In this paper, we focus on the 3D-integrated designs of SRAM structures. We show that the dense die-to-die vias enable 3D-integrated SRAM components that are partitioned at the level of individual wordlines or bitlines. This results in a wire length reduction within SRAM arrays, and a reduction in the area footprint, which reduces the wires required for global routing. The wire length reduction provides simultaneous latency and energy reduction benefits, e.g., 47 percent latency reduction and 18 percent energy reduction for a 4 MB 4-die stacked 3D SRAM array. A 3D implementation of a 128-entry multiported SRAM array achieves a 36 percent latency improvement with a simultaneous energy reduction of 55 percent. As planar designs adapt high-performance techniques such as hierarchical wordlines to improve performance, 3D integration provides even larger benefits, making it a desirable technology for high-performance designs. For the 4 MB SRAM array, the 3D-integrated designs provide additional latency reduction benefit over the planar designs when hierarchical wordlines are implemented in both planar and 3D designs.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5161253/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 July 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2009","publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5161253/","dateOfInsertion":"28 August 2009","accessionNumber":"10847110","volume":"58","issue":"10","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"3D-Integrated SRAM Components for High-Performance Microprocessors","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"3D-Integrated SRAM Components for High-Performance Microprocessors","sourcePdf":"ttc2009101369.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.144472S","chronDate":"Oct.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"12","isNumber":"5226180","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"46","xplore-issue":"5226180","articleId":"5161253","onlineDate":"10 July 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-09"},{"_id":5161270,"authors":[{"name":"Rick S.

regrowth after clipping is one disadvantage of space-frequency block coded orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (SFBC-OFDM). In this letter, we propose an effective PAPR reduction technique of SFBC-OFDM for multinode cooperative transmission. To reduce PAPR at the source (mobile equipment), the relay applies SFBC encoding, which enables the source to transmit clipped single-input single-output (SISO)-OFDM signals without any increase of PAPR. Simulation results show that the clipped signals of proposed scheme are effectively recovered, and the proposed scheme achieves the diversity of SFBC without the complexity of multiple antennas at the source.","doi":"10.1109/LSP.2009.2027154","publicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/97/5208449/05161272.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LSP.2009.2027154","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5208449","startPage":"925","endPage":"928","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Effective PAPR Reduction of SFBC-OFDM for Multinode Cooperative Transmission","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5161272","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"An Effective PAPR Reduction of SFBC-OFDM for Multinode Cooperative Transmission","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5161272/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 July 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"16","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","accessionNumber":"10828792","dateOfInsertion":"18 August 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5161272/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Effective PAPR Reduction of SFBC-OFDM for Multinode Cooperative Transmission","sourcePdf":"16lsp11-gim-2027154.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.065048S","chronDate":"Nov.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"97","isNumber":"5208449","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"97","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"5208449","articleId":"5161272","onlineDate":"10 July 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5161274,"authors":[{"name":"Liping Yan","affiliation":["College of Electronics and Information Engineering, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8/5230340/5161274/5161274-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Liping Yan (M'08) was born in Hebei, China, in 1972.

The well-known Green's function representation in terms of branch cuts (continuous spectrum), residues (discrete spectrum), and direct source-receiver radiation is used to clarify important wave processes for typical intra-chip antenna structures. It is found that surface waves may or may not provide the dominant propagation channel contribution, depending on frequency and chip structure. We generalize the concept of multipath to include multiple spectral (e.g., discrete and continuous) wave components, appropriate for the near- and intermediate-field problems of interest for chip-scale propagation. The effect of a guiding layer placed either below or above the silicon substrate is considered. It is found that a guiding layer can provide enhanced single-channel signal transmission via the surface wave channel, and thereby reduce dispersion associated with multi wave component effects.","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2009.2027158","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8/5230340/05161274.pdf","startPage":"2715","endPage":"2724","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2009.2027158","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5230340","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Wave Propagation Mechanisms for Intra-Chip Communications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5161274","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 July 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5161274/","displayDocTitle":"Wave Propagation Mechanisms for Intra-Chip Communications","volume":"57","issue":"9","publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10847295","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5161274/","dateOfInsertion":"01 September 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wave Propagation Mechanisms for Intra-Chip Communications","sourcePdf":"tap-yan-2027158.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.07443S","chronDate":"Sept.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"5230340","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"5230340","articleId":"5161274","onlineDate":"10 July 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5161278,"authors":[{"name":"Mohammed F.

First, an appropriate Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional is introduced to form some new delay-dependent stability conditions in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). Quite differently, these stability criteria are derived by using the convex combination property, which equivalently converts the original LMI containing a convex combination on the time-varying delay into two boundary LMIs. Second, this newly proposed approach is then extended to a class of uncertain neural networks with time-varying delays, from which new delay-dependent robust stability criteria are formulated. Finally, two numerical examples are given to show that the proposed criteria are of much less conservatism than the existing ones in the literature.","doi":"10.1109/TCSII.2009.2024244","startPage":"659","endPage":"663","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSII.2009.2024244","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5204514","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","pdfPath":"/iel5/8920/5204514/05161281.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"New Globally Asymptotic Stability Criteria for Delayed Cellular Neural Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5161281/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"New Globally Asymptotic Stability Criteria for Delayed Cellular Neural Networks","volume":"56","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/5161281/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10828701","publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"18 August 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 July 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"New Globally Asymptotic Stability Criteria for Delayed Cellular Neural Networks","sourcePdf":"tcsii-zhang-2024244.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.064917S","chronDate":"Aug.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"8920","isNumber":"5204514","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8920","citationCount":"70","xplore-issue":"5204514","articleId":"5161281","onlineDate":"10 July 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5161290,"authors":[{"name":"Tutku Karacolak","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Mississippi State University, MN, USA"],"firstName":"Tutku","lastName":"Karacolak","id":"37394075400"},{"name":"Robert Cooper","affiliation":["College of Veterinary Medicine, Mississippi State University, MN, USA"],"firstName":"Robert","lastName":"Cooper","id":"37398897600"},{"name":"Erdem Topsakal","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Mississippi State University, MN, USA"],"firstName":"Erdem","lastName":"Topsakal","id":"37275226700"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-926X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2221"}],"articleNumber":"5161290","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":88,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":1804},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society","url":"http://www.ieeeaps.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5161290","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Skin","Telemetry","Dual band","Biomedical monitoring","Medical tests","Implants","Microwave integrated circuits","Communication industry","Animals","Condition monitoring"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bioelectric phenomena","biomedical telemetry","biomimetics","boundary integral equations","finite element analysis","multifrequency antennas","particle swarm optimisation","patient monitoring","skin"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["skin electrical property","implantable antenna","medical wireless telemetry","dual band antenna","Medical Implant Communications Service","MICS","ISM bands","wireless medical monitoring","physiological parameter","Mississippi State University","finite element boundary integral solver","particle swarm optimization algorithm","skin-mimicking material","frequency 402 MHz to 405 MHz","frequency 2.4 GHz to 2.48 GHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Implantable antenna","medical implant communications service (MICS) band","scientific and medical (ISM) band","skin-mimicking material"]}],"abstract":"The design and test is described of a small size dual band implantable antenna operating in Medical Implant Communications Service (MICS) (402 MHz-405 MHz) and Industrial, Scientific and Medical (ISM) (2.4 GHz-2.48 GHz) bands to be used in animal studies for medical research.

The model is based on the so-called ldquotop-of-the-barrier-transportrdquo model, and we refer to it as the ldquovirtual sourcerdquo (VS) model.

Three fitted physical parameters are as follows: 1) carrier low-field effective mobility; 2) parasitic source/drain resistance, 3) the saturation region carrier velocity at the so-called virtual source. Lastly, a constrained saturation-transition-region empirical parameter is also fitted. The modeled current versus voltage characteristics and their derivatives are continuous from weak to strong inversion and from the linear to saturation regimes of operation. Remarkable agreement with published state-of-the-art planar short-channel strained devices is demonstrated using physically meaningful values of the fitted physical parameters. Moreover, the model allows for good physical insight in device performance properties, such as extraction of the VSV, which is a parameter of critical technological importance that allows for continued MOSFET performance scaling. The simplicity of the model and the fact that it only uses physically meaningful parameters provides an easy way for technology benchmarking and performance projection.","doi":"10.1109/TED.2009.2024022","startPage":"1674","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel5/16/5170230/05161294.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TED.2009.2024022","endPage":"1680","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5170230","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Simple Semiempirical Short-Channel MOSFET Current\u2013Voltage Model Continuous Across All Regions of Operation and Employing Only Physical Parameters","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5161294/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 July 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2009","displayDocTitle":"A Simple Semiempirical Short-Channel MOSFET Current\u2013Voltage Model Continuous Across All Regions of Operation and Employing Only Physical Parameters","volume":"56","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/5161294/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"10791378","dateOfInsertion":"21 July 2009","publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Simple Semiempirical Short-Channel MOSFET Current\u2013Voltage Model Continuous Across All Regions of Operation and Employing Only Physical Parameters","sourcePdf":"ted-nayfeh-2024022.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.127277S","chronDate":"Aug.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"16","isNumber":"5170230","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"151","xplore-issue":"5170230","articleId":"5161294","onlineDate":"10 July 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5161300,"authors":[{"name":"Milan M.

This is the first general 3D implementation and numerical demonstration of the inherent theoretical ability of the finite element method (FEM) to directly treat arbitrarily (continuously) inhomogeneous materials. The results demonstrate considerable reductions in both number of unknowns and computation time of the entire-domain FEM modeling of continuously inhomogeneous materials over piecewise homogeneous models. They indicate that, in addition to theoretical relevance and interest, large curved higher order continuous-FEM elements also have great potential for practical applications that include structures with pronounced material inhomogeneities and complexities.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8/5230340/05161300.pdf","startPage":"2798","endPage":"2803","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2009.2027350","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2009.2027350","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5230340","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5161300","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Continuously Inhomogeneous Higher Order Finite Elements for 3-D Electromagnetic Analysis","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Finite element methods","Electromagnetic analysis","Magnetic analysis","Electromagnetic propagation","Antennas and propagation","Lenses","Electromagnetic scattering","Electromagnetic modeling","Nonuniform electric fields","Permittivity"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational electromagnetics","curve fitting","electromagnetic wave scattering","finite element analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["full-wave 3D electromagnetic analysis","higher order entire-domain finite element technique","continuously inhomogeneous material region","large generalized curved hierarchical curl-conforming hexahedral vector","FEM","piecewise homogeneous model","electromagnetic scattering","computer aided analysis"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Computer-aided analysis","electromagnetic analysis","electromagnetic scattering","finite element method","higher order elements","inhomogeneous media","method of moments"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5161300/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 July 2009","displayDocTitle":"Continuously Inhomogeneous Higher Order Finite Elements for 3-D Electromagnetic Analysis","volume":"57","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/5161300/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10847319","dateOfInsertion":"01 September 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Continuously Inhomogeneous Higher Order Finite Elements for 3-D Electromagnetic Analysis","sourcePdf":"57tap09-bnotaros-2027350.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.06457S","chronDate":"Sept.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"5230340","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"5230340","articleId":"5161300","onlineDate":"10 July 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5161301,"authors":[{"name":"Atabak Rashidian","affiliation":["Telecommunications Research Laboratories, Saskatoon, SAS, Canada","University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, SAS, Canada"],"firstName":"Atabak","lastName":"Rashidian","id":"38502678700"},{"name":"David M.

The approach of using high aspect ratio structures is proposed, discussed, and compared with the two segmented structures approach. Finite element method parametric study of high permittivity high aspect ratio structures is used to demonstrate how two appropriate resonant modes can be merged to obtain miniaturized antennas with broadband operation, stable radiation patterns, and low cross polarization levels. To show the effectiveness of the approach, a set of microstrip-fed two segmented and high aspect ratio DRAs is fabricated, characterized, and the results are compared with Ansoft HFSS simulations. A high aspect ratio DRA with cross section as small as 0.08lambda by 0.12lambda has better than 11 percent bandwidth and is especially attractive for compact array

Therefore, integration of features and classifiers can bring benefits to cope with this problem, particularly when the parts are carefully chosen and synergistically combined. In this paper, we address the problem of pedestrian detection by a novel ensemble method. Initially, histograms of oriented gradients (HOGs) and local receptive fields (LRFs), which are provided by a convolutional neural network, have been both classified by multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) and support vector machines (SVMs). A diversity measure is used to refine the initial set of feature extractors and classifiers. A final classifier ensemble was then structured by an HOG and an LRF as features, classified by two SVMs and one MLP. We have analyzed the following two classes of fusion methods of combining the outputs of the component classifiers: (1) majority vote and (2) fuzzy integral. The first part of the performance evaluation consisted of running the final proposed ensemble over the DaimlerChrysler cropwise data set, which was also artificially modified to simulate sunny and shadowy illumination conditions, which is typical of outdoor scenarios. Then, a window-wise study has been performed over a collected video sequence. Experiments have highlighted a state-of-the-art classification system, performing consistently better than the component classifiers and other methods.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 July 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5161309/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2010","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"11","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 2010","dateOfInsertion":"25 February 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5161309/","accessionNumber":"11151949","displayDocTitle":"On Exploration of Classifier Ensemble Synergism in Pedestrian Detection","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On Exploration of Classifier Ensemble Synergism in Pedestrian Detection","sourcePdf":"tits-oliveira-2026447.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.085201S","chronDate":"March  2010","xplore-pub-id":"6979","isNumber":"5420295","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6979","citationCount":"47","xplore-issue":"5420295","articleId":"5161309","onlineDate":"10 July 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5161312,"authors":[{"name":"Takashi Mizuochi","affiliation":["Mitsubishi Electric Corporation Limited, Kamakura, Japan"],"firstName":"Takashi","lastName":"Mizuochi","id":"37274287600"},{"name":"Yoshiaki Konishi","affiliation":["Mitsubishi Electric Corporation Limited, Kamakura, Japan"],"firstName":"Yoshiaki","lastName":"Konishi","id":"37402141100"},{"name":"Yoshikuni Miyata","affiliation":["Mitsubishi Electric Corporation Limited, Kamakura, Japan"],"firstName":"Yoshikuni","lastName":"Miyata","id":"37274286100"},{"name":"Tomoka Inoue","affiliation":["Mitsubishi Electric Corporation Limited, Kamakura, Japan"],"firstName":"Tomoka","lastName":"Inoue","id":"37405925900"},{"name":"Kiyoshi Onohara","affiliation":["Mitsubishi Electric Corporation Limited, Kamakura, Japan"],"firstName":"Kiyoshi","lastName":"Onohara","id":"37265396300"},{"name":"Soichiro Kametani","affiliation":["Mitsubishi Electric Corporation Limited, Kamakura, Japan"],"firstName":"Soichiro","lastName":"Kametani","id":"37318584200"},{"name":"Takashi Sugihara","affiliation":["Mitsubishi Electric Corporation Limited, Kamakura, Japan"],"firstName":"Takashi","lastName":"Sugihara","id":"37307067400"},{"name":"Kazuo Kubo","affiliation":["Mitsubishi Electric Corporation Limited, Kamakura, Japan"],"firstName":"Kazuo","lastName":"Kubo","id":"37280732200"},{"name":"Hideo Yoshida","affiliation":["Mitsubishi Electric Corporation Limited, Kamakura, Japan"],"firstName":"Hideo","lastName":"Yoshida","id":"37280561500"},{"name":"Tatsuya Kobayashi","affiliation":["Mitsubishi Electric Corporation Limited, Kamakura, Japan"],"firstName":"Tatsuya","lastName":"Kobayashi","id":"37277784100"},{"name":"Toshiyuki Ichikawa","affiliation":["Mitsubishi Electric Corporation Limited, Kamakura, Japan"],"firstName":"Toshiyuki","lastName":"Ichikawa","id":"37396756900"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1041-1135"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0174"}],"articleNumber":"5161312","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":30,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":833},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Photonics Society","url":"http://www.PhotonicsSociety.org"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5161312","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Concatenated codes","Parity check codes","Field programmable gate arrays","Emulation","Reed-Solomon codes","Forward error correction","Large scale integration","Gain","Redundancy","Iterative decoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["concatenated codes","error statistics","field programmable gate arrays","forward error correction","iterative decoding","parity check codes","Reed-Solomon codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["LDPC codes","RS codes","FPGA","low-density parity-check code","Reed-Solomon code","forward error correction","2-bit soft-decision large-scale integration","iterative decoding","bit-error rate","bit rate 31.3 Gbit/s","gain 9.0 dB"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Concatenated coding","field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs)","forward error correction (FEC)","optical communication","Reed\u2013Solomon (RS) codes"]}],"abstract":"The concatenation of low-density parity-check and Reed-Solomon codes for forward error correction has been experimentally demonstrated for the first time in this letter.

The high-dispersion tolerance comes from the subcarrier cross-selection with only one data-bearing tone before signal beating in the receiver. The power penalty of 1.4 dB for 60-GHz carrier and negligible degradation for baseband and upstream are achieved for 2.5-Gb/s signal after 50-km single-mode fiber (SMF-28) and 4-m air link transmission. The theoretical analysis is also provided to obtain the optimal operation point.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5161317/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 July 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.15,  2009","volume":"21","issue":"18","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"04 September 2009","accessionNumber":"10866447","publicationDate":"Sept.15, 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5161317/","isStaticHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Novel Bidirectional 60-GHz Radio-Over-Fiber Scheme With Multiband Signal Generation Using a Single Intensity Modulator","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel Bidirectional 60-GHz Radio-Over-Fiber Scheme With Multiband Signal Generation Using a Single Intensity Modulator","sourcePdf":"lpt-hsueh-2026061.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038844S","chronDate":"Sept.15,  2009","xplore-pub-id":"68","isNumber":"5230334","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"68","citationCount":"53","xplore-issue":"5230334","articleId":"5161317","onlineDate":"10 July 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-21"},{"_id":5161319,"authors":[{"name":"Maria Morant","affiliation":["Wireless-Photonics Integration Group, Nanophotonics Technology Centre, Universidad Polit\u00e9cnica de Valencia, Valencia, Spain"],"firstName":"Maria","lastName":"Morant","id":"37315536900"},{"name":"Joaquin Perez","affiliation":["Wireless-Photonics Integration Group, Nanophotonics Technology Centre, Universidad Polit\u00e9cnica de Valencia, Valencia, Spain"],"firstName":"Joaquin","lastName":"Perez","id":"37307179800"},{"name":"Roberto Llorente","affiliation":["Wireless-Photonics Integration Group, Nanophotonics Technology Centre, Universidad Polit\u00e9cnica de Valencia, Valencia, Spain"],"firstName":"Roberto","lastName":"Llorente","id":"37313992500"},{"name":"Javier Marti","affiliation":["Wireless-Photonics Integration Group, Nanophotonics Technology Centre, Universidad Polit\u00e9cnica de Valencia, Valencia, Spain"],"firstName":"Javier","lastName":"Marti","id":"37277670500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1041-1135"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0174"}],"articleNumber":"5161319","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":233},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Photonics Society","url":"http://www.PhotonicsSociety.org"}],"abstract":"The hybrid wireless-optical transmission of ultra-wideband signals employing orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing modulation (OFDM) ultra-wideband (UWB) as defined in the ECMA-368 standard is experimentally analyzed in this letter.

The proposed approach aims at selecting a subset of the original set of features that exhibits at the same time high capability to discriminate among the considered classes and high invariance in the spatial domain of the investigated scene. This approach results in a more robust classification system with improved generalization properties with respect to standard feature-selection methods. The feature selection is accomplished by defining a multiobjective criterion function made up of two terms: (1) a term that measures the class separability and (2) a term that evaluates the spatial invariance of the selected features. In order to assess the spatial invariance of the feature subset, we propose both a supervised method (which assumes that training samples acquired in two or more spatially disjoint areas are available) and a semisupervised method (which requires only a standard training set acquired in a single area of the scene and takes advantage of unlabeled samples selected in portions of the scene spatially disjoint from the training set). The choice for the supervised or semisupervised method depends on the available reference data. The multiobjective problem is solved by an evolutionary algorithm that estimates the set of Pareto-optimal solutions. Experiments carried out on a hyperspectral image acquired by the Hyperion sensor on a complex area confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed approach.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel5/36/5210215/05161332.pdf","startPage":"3180","endPage":"3191","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2009.2019636","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2009.2019636","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5210215","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5161332","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Novel Approach to the Selection of Spatially Invariant Features for the Classification of Hyperspectral Images With Improved Generalization Capability","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hyperspectral imaging","Hyperspectral sensors","Layout","Robustness","Image classification","Remote sensing","Classification algorithms","Kernel","Evolutionary computation","Image sensors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feature extraction","image classification","terrain mapping"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["spatially invariant features selection","hyperspectral image classification","improved generalization capability","standard feature-selection methods","multiobjective criterion function","supervised method","semisupervised method","Pareto-optimal solutions","hyperion remote sensing sensor","land-cover types"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Expectation\u2013maximization (EM) algorithm","feature selection","hyperspectral images","image classification","remote sensing","robust features","semisupervised feature selection","stationary features"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5161332/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 July 2009","displayDocTitle":"A Novel Approach to the Selection of Spatially Invariant Features for the Classification of Hyperspectral Images With Improved Generalization Capability","volume":"47","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/5161332/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10840351","dateOfInsertion":"21 August 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel Approach to the Selection of Spatially Invariant Features for the Classification of Hyperspectral Images With Improved Generalization Capability","sourcePdf":"tgrs-bruzzone-2019636.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.118718S","chronDate":"Sept.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"5210215","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"97","xplore-issue":"5210215","articleId":"5161332","onlineDate":"10 July 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5161333,"authors":[{"name":"Fernando H.

Perceptrons provide a medium for relating results from neural networks, genetic algorithms, animal learning, contingency theory, reinforcement learning, and theories of choice.","doi":"10.1109/TNN.2009.2025588","startPage":"1368","endPage":"1371","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNN.2009.2025588","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5191259","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/72/5191259/05161343.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Simple Artificial Neural Networks That Match Probability and Exploit and Explore When Confronting a Multiarmed Bandit","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5161343/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Simple Artificial Neural Networks That Match Probability and Exploit and Explore When Confronting a Multiarmed Bandit","volume":"20","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/5161343/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10805289","pubMedId":"19596631","publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"04 August 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 July 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Simple Artificial Neural Networks That Match Probability and Exploit and Explore When Confronting a Multiarmed Bandit","sourcePdf":"tnn-mdawson-2025588.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.097952S","chronDate":"Aug.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"72","isNumber":"5191259","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"5191259","articleId":"5161343","onlineDate":"10 July 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5161346,"authors":[{"name":"Guorui Feng","affiliation":["School of Communication and Information Engineering, Shanghai University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Guorui","lastName":"Feng","id":"37539439700"},{"name":"Guang-Bin Huang","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Guang-Bin","lastName":"Huang","id":"37274328900"},{"name":"Qingping Lin","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Qingping","lastName":"Lin","id":"37574850700"},{"name":"Robert Gay","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Robert","lastName":"Gay","id":"37272699500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1045-9227"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0093"}],"articleNumber":"5161346","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":471,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":3852},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computational Intelligence Society","url":"http://ieee-cis.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5161346","abstract":"One of the open problems in neural network research is how to automatically determine network architectures for given applications. In this brief, we propose a simple and efficient approach to automatically determine the number of hidden nodes in generalized single-hidden-layer feedforward networks (SLFNs) which need not be neural alike. This approach referred to as error minimized extreme learning machine (EM-ELM) can add random hidden nodes to SLFNs one by one or group by group (with varying group size). During the growth of the networks, the output weights are updated incrementally. The convergence of this approach is proved in this brief as well.

It is well known that short-term load forecasting results always carry certain degree of errors mainly due to the random nature of the load. At the same time, LMP step changes occur at critical load levels (CLLs). Therefore, it is interesting to investigate the impact of load forecasting uncertainty on LMP. With the assumption of a certain probability distribution of the actual load, this paper proposes the concept of probabilistic LMP and formulates the probability mass function of this random variable. The expected value of probabilistic LMP is then derived, as well as the lower and upper bound of its sensitivity. In addition, two useful curves, alignment probability of deterministic LMP versus forecasted load and expected value of probabilistic LMP versus forecasted load, are presented. The first curve is designed to identify the probability that the forecasted price in a deterministic LMP matches the actual price at the forecasted load level. The second curve is demonstrated to be smooth and therefore eliminates the step changes in deterministic LMP forecasting. This helps planners avoid the possible sharp changes during decision-making process. The proposed concept and method are illustrated with a modified PJM five-bus system and the IEEE 118-bus system.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 July 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5161350/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2009","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"24","issue":"3","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"21 July 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5161350/","accessionNumber":"10793408","displayDocTitle":"Probabilistic LMP Forecasting Considering Load Uncertainty","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Probabilistic LMP Forecasting Considering Load Uncertainty","sourcePdf":"24tpwrs03-rbo-2023268.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.055268S","chronDate":"Aug.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"59","isNumber":"5170200","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"97","xplore-issue":"5170200","articleId":"5161350","onlineDate":"10 July 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5161351,"authors":[{"name":"Jianhui Wang","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, Illinois Institute of Technology, Chicago, IL, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Jianhui Wang received the Ph.D. degree in the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department at Illinois Institute of Technology (IIT), Chicago, in 2007.","He was a Senior Research Associate after graduation in the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department at IIT and is currently employed by the Argonne National Laboratory."]},"firstName":"Jianhui","lastName":"Wang","id":"37539030000"},{"name":"Mohammad Shahidehpour","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, Illinois Institute of Technology, Chicago, IL, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Mohammad Shahidehpour (F'01) is the Carl Bodine Professor and Chairman in the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department at Illinois Institute of Technology, Chicago.

Operated at a 1.8-V supply, the LNA consumes a dc power of 36 mW.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Low-noise amplifiers","MOSFETs","Millimeter wave technology","Millimeter wave circuits","Millimeter wave transistors","Cutoff frequency","Feedback","CMOS process","Circuit topology","Bandwidth"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS integrated circuits","low noise amplifiers","millimetre wave integrated circuits","network topology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["positive-feedback network","circuit topology","CMOS millimeter-wave low-noise amplifier","common-gate transistor","inter-stage matching","cascaded amplifiers","size 0.18 mum","frequency 40 GHz","noise figure 7.5 dB","gain 15 dB","voltage 1.8 V","power 36 mW"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Coplanar waveguide (CPW)","cutoff frequencies"," $LC$ ladders","low-noise amplifier (LNA)","millimeter wave","positive feedback"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TMTT.2009.2025418","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel5/22/5200722/05161354.pdf","startPage":"1895","endPage":"1902","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5200722","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.2009.2025418","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 40-GHz Low-Noise Amplifier With a Positive-Feedback Network in 0.18-- CMOS","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5161354","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A 40-GHz Low-Noise Amplifier With a Positive-Feedback Network in 0.18-<formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex Notation=\"TeX\">$\\mu{\\hbox{m}}$</tex> </formula> CMOS","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5161354/","volume":"57","issue":"8","publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5161354/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"10816581","dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 July 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 40-GHz Low-Noise Amplifier With a Positive-Feedback Network in 0.18-<formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex Notation=\"TeX\">$\\mu{\\hbox{m}}$</tex> </formula> CMOS","sourcePdf":"tmtt-lu-2025418.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.088356S","chronDate":"Aug.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"5200722","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"34","xplore-issue":"5200722","articleId":"5161354","onlineDate":"10 July 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5161508,"authors":[{"name":"Raimund Kirner","affiliation":["Institut f\u00fcr Technische Informatik, Technische Universit\u00e4t Wien, Austria"],"firstName":"Raimund","lastName":"Kirner","id":"37297470800"},{"name":"Albrecht Kadlec","affiliation":["Institut f\u00fcr Technische Informatik, Technische Universit\u00e4t Wien, Austria"],"firstName":"Albrecht","lastName":"Kadlec","id":"37568736200"},{"name":"Peter Puschner","affiliation":["Institut f\u00fcr Technische Informatik, Technische Universit\u00e4t Wien, Austria"],"firstName":"Peter","lastName":"Puschner","id":"37279665700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3724-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1068-3070"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2377-5998"}],"articleNumber":"5161508","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":143},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Timing","Computer aided instruction","Hardware","Real time systems","State-space methods","Performance analysis","Contracts","Pipelines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["program processors","timing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["precise worst-case execution time analysis","processors","timing anomalies","control-flow graph","parallel decomposition","parallel decomposition technique"]}],"abstract":"This paper explores timing anomalies in WCET analysis.Timing anomalies add to the complexity of WCET analysis and make it hard to apply divide-and-conquer strategies to simplify the WCET assessment. So far, timing anomalies have been described as a problem that occurs when the WCET of a control-flow graph is computed from the WCETs of its subgraphs, i.e., from a series decomposition. This paper extends the state of the art by (i) showing that timing anomalies can as well occur in a parallel decomposition of the WCET problem, i.e., when complexity is reduced by splitting the hardware state space and performing a separate WCET analysis for hardware components that work in parallel, (ii) proving that the potential occurrence of parallel timing anomalies makes the parallel decomposition technique unsafe (i.e., one cannot guarantee that the calculated WCET bound does not underestimate the WCET), and (iii) identifying special cases of parallel timing anomalies for which the parallel decomposition technique is safe. The latter provides an important hint to hardware designers on their way to constructing predictable hardware components.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Precise Worst-Case Execution Time Analysis for Processors with Timing Anomalies","publicationTitle":"2009 21st Euromicro Conference on Real-Time Systems","doi":"10.1109/ECRTS.2009.8","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 21st Euromicro Conference on Real-Time Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5161487/5161488/05161508.pdf","startPage":"119","endPage":"128","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ECRTS.2009.8","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5161488","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5161508","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5161508/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 July 2009","displayDocTitle":"Precise Worst-Case Execution Time Analysis for Processors with Timing Anomalies","conferenceDate":"1-3 July 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5161508/","dateOfInsertion":"10 July 2009","publicationDate":"July 2009","accessionNumber":"10750490","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Precise Worst-Case Execution Time Analysis for Processors with Timing Anomalies","confLoc":"Dublin, Ireland","sourcePdf":"3724a119.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.082473S","chronDate":"1-3 July 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5161487","isNumber":"5161488","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5161487","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"5161488","articleId":"5161508","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-29"},{"_id":5161515,"authors":[{"name":"John M.

Most such chips contain on-chip caches that are shared by some or all of the cores on the chip. Prior work has presented methods for improving the performance of such caches when scheduling soft real-time workloads. Given these methods, two additional research issues arise: (1) how to automatically profile the cache behavior of real-time tasks within the scheduler; and (2) how to implement scheduling methods efficiently, so that scheduling overheads do not offset any cache-related performance gains. This paper addresses these two issues in an implementation of a cache-aware soft real-time scheduler within Linux, and shows that the use of this scheduler can result in performance improvements that directly result from a decrease in shared cache miss rates.","pdfPath":"/iel5/5161487/5161488/05161515.pdf","startPage":"194","endPage":"204","publicationTitle":"2009 21st Euromicro Conference on Real-Time Systems","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5161488","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ECRTS.2009.13","doi":"10.1109/ECRTS.2009.13","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 21st Euromicro Conference on Real-Time Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5161515","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multicore processing","Job shop scheduling","Real time systems","Sun","Processor scheduling","Manufacturing processes","Performance gain","System performance","Computer science","Computer architecture"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cache storage","Linux","multiprocessing systems","operating system kernels","processor scheduling","real-time systems","system-on-chip"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cache-aware multicore real-time scheduler","Linux kernel","system-on-chip"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 July 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5161515/","displayDocTitle":"On the Design and Implementation of a Cache-Aware Multicore Real-Time Scheduler","accessionNumber":"10750496","dateOfInsertion":"10 July 2009","publicationDate":"July 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5161515/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"1-3 July 2009","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Design and Implementation of a Cache-Aware Multicore Real-Time Scheduler","confLoc":"Dublin, Ireland","sourcePdf":"3724a194.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054627S","chronDate":"1-3 July 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5161487","isNumber":"5161488","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5161487","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"5161488","articleId":"5161515","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-10"},{"_id":5161662,"authors":[{"name":"Neminath Hubballi","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Guwahati, India"],"firstName":"Neminath","lastName":"Hubballi","id":"37402969700"},{"name":"Santosh Biswas","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Guwahati, India"],"firstName":"Santosh","lastName":"Biswas","id":"37274963900"},{"name":"Sukumar Nandi","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Guwahati, India"],"firstName":"Sukumar","lastName":"Nandi","id":"37279938500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-2-9532-4431-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5161662","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":132},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Intrusion detection","Clustering algorithms","Traffic control","Telecommunication traffic","Robustness","Algorithm design and analysis","Prototypes","Fuzzy systems","Computer science","Feature extraction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fuzzy set theory","pattern clustering","security of data","statistical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fuzzy mega cluster","anomaly network intrusion detection","cluster analysis","feature vector","network traffic","fuzzy clustering technique","fuzzy c-means algorithm"]}],"abstract":"Most of the anomaly based techniques produce vast number of alert messages that include a large percentage of false alarms. One of the widely used technique for anomaly intrusion detection systems (IDS) is cluster analysis. In cluster based IDS, feature vectors generated from network traffic are grouped into clusters as normal or abnormal (raising alert). The main cause for false alert generation is either, technique fails to differentiate an outlier from a genuine cluster point or the features extracted fail to separate the two classes. In this work, fuzzy clustering technique for anomaly intrusion detection has been explored to reduce the false alarms.

The results suggest that the proposed method and procedures can be an effective tool for landslide monitoring and would be easily transferred to other similar applications.","doi":"10.1109/JSTARS.2009.2023802","startPage":"87","endPage":"95","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSTARS.2009.2023802","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5230337","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4609443/5230337/05161708.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Application of Remote Sensing Technology to the Interpretation of Land Use for Rainfall-Induced Landslides Based on Genetic Algorithms and Artificial Neural Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5161708/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"The Application of Remote Sensing Technology to the Interpretation of Land Use for Rainfall-Induced Landslides Based on Genetic Algorithms and Artificial Neural Networks","volume":"2","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/5161708/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10847414","publicationDate":"June 2009","dateOfInsertion":"01 September 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 July 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Application of Remote Sensing Technology to the Interpretation of Land Use for Rainfall-Induced Landslides Based on Genetic Algorithms and Artificial Neural Networks","sourcePdf":"jstars-ychen-2023802.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.11186S","chronDate":"June  2009","xplore-pub-id":"4609443","isNumber":"5230337","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4609443","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"5230337","articleId":"5161708","onlineDate":"10 July 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-26"},{"_id":5161736,"authors":[{"name":"Sung-Jun Hwang","affiliation":["Department ECE, Ohio State Uinversity, Columbus, OH, USA"],"firstName":"Sung-Jun","lastName":"Hwang","id":"37292257000"},{"name":"Philip Schniter","affiliation":["Department ECE, Ohio State Uinversity, Columbus, OH, USA"],"firstName":"Philip","lastName":"Schniter","id":"37271304700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3695-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3696-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1948-3244"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1948-3252"}],"articleNumber":"5161736","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":81},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Equalizers","Iterative decoding","Gaussian channels","MIMO","Channel estimation","Robustness","Radio frequency","Algorithm design and analysis","Parity check codes","Turbo codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","expectation-maximisation algorithm","turbo codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["soft noncoherent equalization","doubly selective channels","tree search","coded transmissions","soft decoder","turbo reception scheme","expectation maximization algorithm","soft channel estimation","soft coherent equalization","Gauss-Markov channel","basis expansion model"]}],"abstract":"We propose a soft noncoherent equalizer for coded transmissions over unknown time- and frequency-selective, or doubly selective, channels. Such a soft equalizer can be used in conjunction with a soft decoder as part of a turbo reception scheme. Like a number of existing designs, ours is motivated by the use of the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm to estimate the unknown channel parameters, and manifests as an iteration between soft channel estimation and soft coherent equalization. As a departure from the existing designs, which assume a Gauss-Markov (i.e., autoregressive) channel and employ a trellis whose number-of-states grows exponentially in the channel length, we use a basis expansion (BE) model for the channel and a soft tree-search in place of the trellis, leveraging recent ideas from the MIMO literature. The complexity of our schemes grows only linearly in the block length and quadratically in the number of BE coefficients. Numerical experiments show performance that is close to genie-aided bounds and robust to mismatch in channel-fading rate.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"EM-based soft noncoherent equalization of doubly selective channels using tree search and basis expansion","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 10th Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/SPAWC.2009.5161736","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 10th Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5154399/5161729/05161736.pdf","startPage":"6","endPage":"10","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPAWC.2009.5161736","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5161729","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5161736","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5161736/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"EM-based soft noncoherent equalization of doubly selective channels using tree search and basis expansion","conferenceDate":"21-24 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5161736/","dateOfInsertion":"10 July 2009","publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10761900","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"EM-based soft noncoherent equalization of doubly selective channels using tree search and basis expansion","confLoc":"Perugia, Italy","sourcePdf":"1569186434.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063584S","chronDate":"21-24 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5154399","isNumber":"5161729","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5154399","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"5161729","articleId":"5161736","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":5161737,"authors":[{"name":"Stefano Tomasin","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, University of Padova, Padova, Italy"],"firstName":"Stefano","lastName":"Tomasin","id":"37282514600"},{"name":"Matteo Butussi","affiliation":["Abilis Systems Sarl, Geneve, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Matteo","lastName":"Butussi","id":"37396247900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3695-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3696-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1948-3244"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1948-3252"}],"articleNumber":"5161737","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":134},"abstract":"Channel estimation for OFDM system using pilot carriers usually comprises time interpolation of the estimates across more OFDM symbols and then frequency interpolation. In order to improve estimate, the frequency response can be transformed into the time domain and windowed. To this end, an estimate of the channel duration is necessary and this process is particularly sensitive to the time interpolation process. In fact, for a transmission over a time-varying channel, if the time interpolation of the pilot estimates is not accurate, aliases arise in the estimated channel impulse response, thus affecting the channel duration estimate. We propose a technique to detect aliases and correct the estimation of channel duration. Parameters of the detection techniques are optimized by an analysis that provides closed-form expressions of the false alarm and miss detection probabilities. Numerical results show the merits of the proposed techniques in a mobile transmission of the terrestrial digital video broadcasting standard (DVB-T).","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 10th Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5154399/5161729/05161737.pdf","startPage":"11","endPage":"15","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 10th Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/SPAWC.2009.5161737","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPAWC.2009.5161737","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5161729","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5161737","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improved channel duration estimate for mobile OFDM systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Interpolation","Frequency estimation","Digital video broadcasting","Amplitude estimation","Delay estimation","Channel estimation","Noise reduction","Yield estimation","Frequency response"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","digital video broadcasting","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mobile OFDM systems","channel estimation","pilot carriers","time interpolation","frequency interpolation","closed-form expressions","mobile transmission","terrestrial digital video broadcasting standard","DVB-T"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Broadcasting","channel estimation","interpolation","OFDM."]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5161737/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"Improved channel duration estimate for mobile OFDM systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5161737/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10750404","dateOfInsertion":"10 July 2009","conferenceDate":"21-24 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improved channel duration estimate for mobile OFDM systems","confLoc":"Perugia, Italy","sourcePdf":"1569186754.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05271S","chronDate":"21-24 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5154399","isNumber":"5161729","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5154399","xplore-issue":"5161729","articleId":"5161737","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5161738,"authors":[{"name":"Marco Rotoloni","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, University of Padova, Padova, Italy"],"firstName":"Marco","lastName":"Rotoloni","id":"37391702700"},{"name":"Matteo Butussi","affiliation":["Abilis Systems Sarl, Geneva, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Matteo","lastName":"Butussi","id":"37396247900"},{"name":"Stefano Tomasin","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, University of Padova, Padova, Italy"],"firstName":"Stefano","lastName":"Tomasin","id":"37282514600"},{"name":"Mauro Lattuada","affiliation":["Abilis Systems Sarl, Geneva, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Mauro","lastName":"Lattuada","id":"37540622400"},{"name":"Christian Ruppert","affiliation":["Abilis Systems Sarl, Geneva, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Christian","lastName":"Ruppert","id":"37568167600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3695-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3696-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1948-3244"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1948-3252"}],"articleNumber":"5161738","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":144},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Frequency estimation","Adaptive filters","Filtering","OFDM","Channel estimation","Least squares approximation","Interpolation","Smoothing methods","Digital video broadcasting","Mean square error methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive Kalman filters","channel estimation","least mean squares methods","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiple adaptive frequency filtering","OFDM channel estimation","least square channel estimate","time-interpolated estimates","least mean square","Kalman filter","filter coefficient adaptation"]}],"abstract":"Transmission of pilot symbols in orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems allows for an efficient least square (LS) channel estimate on pilots and its time/frequency interpolation over data carrier. In order to improve channel estimate, the correlation among pilot estimated and time-interpolated estimates can be exploited. However, while most approaches consider a single smoothing filter over time-interpolated estimates, we propose the use of multiple adaptive filters that take into account the different correlation among pilot estimate and interpolated estimates. In fact, time-interpolated estimates have different reliability than pilot estimates and thus must be weighted differently in the adaptive filtering.We consider both least mean square (LMS) and Kalman filter approach for the filter coefficient adaptation and aim at low-complexity solutions with respect to alternative optimal techniques. Moreover, as a simpler approach we consider also the use of a single adaptive filter updated taking into account the reliability of the various estimates.

To achieve the best tradeoff between energy efficiency and detection reliability, the FC forms the maximum ratio combing (MRC) fusion rule by integrating the partial knowledge of fading channel state information (CSI) and the local sensor performance indices, finds the best set of K (K < N) sensors that maximizes the total detection probability in the Neyman-Pearson (NP) sense, and informs the selected sensors via one bit feedback. The FC learns the Rayleigh flat fading channels, utilizing training symbols sent by the sensors, via applying minimum mean square error (MMSE) channel estimator. Assuming the sensors employ BPSK to modulate their binary local decisions, we derive the MRC fusion rule that depends on the channel estimates and the sensors' performance indices, and incorporates the effect of channel estimation error.

ST is composed of an orthogonal space-time block code (OSTBC) followed by a linear precoder which acts as a multimode beamformer. Given a fixed OSTBC, our goal is to design a robust linear precoder, where the robustness assumes addressing the problem of imperfect channel state information (CSI) of ST to SR (ST-SR) MIMO link at ST. Channel correlation information of ST to PU (ST-PU) link is also available at ST. The imperfect channel knowledge of the ST-SR link is described by a specified uncertainty region, known to ST. The robust precoding design criterion is the maximization of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for the worst-case Frobeneus norm-bounded CSI mismatch subject to the transmit-power constraint of ST and interference-power constraint of PU. The original robust precoder design problem is non-convex and does not have any close-form solution. Using a semidefinite relaxation (SDR) approach, we transform it to a convex form and find the approximate solution using standard numerical methods. Simulation results are presented to show the performance of the robust precoding scheme.","doi":"10.1109/SPAWC.2009.5161752","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 10th Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 10th Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5154399/5161729/05161752.pdf","startPage":"86","endPage":"90","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPAWC.2009.5161752","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5161729","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust precoding for orthogonal space-time block coded MIMO cognitive radio networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5161752","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 June 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5161752/","displayDocTitle":"Robust precoding for orthogonal space-time block coded MIMO cognitive radio networks","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10750411","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5161752/","conferenceDate":"21-24 June 2009","dateOfInsertion":"10 July 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust precoding for orthogonal space-time block coded MIMO cognitive radio networks","confLoc":"Perugia, Italy","sourcePdf":"1569184522.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053501S","chronDate":"21-24 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5154399","isNumber":"5161729","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5154399","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"5161729","articleId":"5161752","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5161753,"authors":[{"name":"Jane W.

However, with the increasing programmability of network users, a malicious user can strategically declare a false state in order to gain an unfair share of resources. How to ensure all the users revel their true information becomes an important issue in the system design. In this paper, we proposed a pricing mechanism which combines the mechanism design with the opportunistic scheduling algorithm and ensures that each rational selfish user maximizes his own utility function, at the same time optimizing the overall system utility. The proposed pricing mechanism is based on the classic Vickrey-Clark-Groves (VCG) mechanism and had several desirable economic properties. A mechanism learning algorithm is then provided for users to learn the mechanism and to obtain the Nash equilibrium. A numerical example shows the Nash equilibrium of such algorithm achieves system optimality.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPAWC.2009.5161753","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5161729","startPage":"91","endPage":"95","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 10th Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5154399/5161729/05161753.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Truth reveling opportunistic scheduling in cognitive radio systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5161753/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 June 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5161753/","displayDocTitle":"Truth reveling opportunistic scheduling in cognitive radio systems","conferenceDate":"21-24 June 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10761909","dateOfInsertion":"10 July 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Truth reveling opportunistic scheduling in cognitive radio systems","confLoc":"Perugia, Italy","sourcePdf":"1569184642.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057514S","chronDate":"21-24 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5154399","isNumber":"5161729","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5154399","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5161729","articleId":"5161753","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5161754,"authors":[{"name":"Roberto Lopez-Valcarce","affiliation":["Departamento de Teor\u00eda de la Se\u00f1al y las Comunicaciones, Universidad de Vigo, Vigo, Spain"],"firstName":"Roberto","lastName":"Lopez-Valcarce","id":"38275836800"},{"name":"Gonzalo Vazquez-Vilar","affiliation":["Departamento de Teor\u00eda de la Se\u00f1al y las Comunicaciones, Universidad de Vigo, Vigo, Spain"],"firstName":"Gonzalo","lastName":"Vazquez-Vilar","id":"38276527500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3695-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3696-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1948-3244"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1948-3252"}],"articleNumber":"5161754","dbTime":"25 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":16,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":306},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wideband","Cognitive radio","Noise level","Monitoring","Maximum likelihood estimation","Frequency estimation","Background noise","Bandwidth","Spectral shape","Least squares approximation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","least squares approximations","maximum likelihood estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wideband spectrum sensing","cognitive radio","joint estimation","noise variance","multiple signal levels","primary users","spectrum monitor","signal power levels","frequency channels","background noise level","maximum likelihood estimation","least squares estimator","Cramer-Rao lower bound"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Wideband spectrum sensing in cognitive radio: Joint estimation of noise variance and multiple signal levels","doi":"10.1109/SPAWC.2009.5161754","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5161729","endPage":"100","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 10th Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 10th Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5154399/5161729/05161754.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPAWC.2009.5161754","startPage":"96","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5161754","abstract":"The cognitive radio paradigm is based on the ability to detect the presence of primary users in a given frequency band.

In this paper we consider primary system that has a target outage performance and the transmission power of the secondary transmitter (STX) should be appropriately not to violate the target outage probability for the primary terminals (PT). We have considered two types of STX, with single antenna (SISO STX) and two antennas (MISO STX) and analyzed the allowed secondary power. In general, the power level allowed for the SISO STX differs from the total power level allowed for the MISO STX. Our analysis shows that the relation between these power levels changes as the direct component (the K-factor) of the Ricean fading in the primary channel changes. For a large K-factor in the primary system, the total power allowed for a MISO STX is higher than the power allowed for a SISO STX system. The situation is reversed when the fading in the primary system has a low value of the K-factor and moves towards Rayleigh fading. This implies that, for example, when the direct component in the primary system is substantial, the usage of multiple antennas in the cognitive system has additional benefit, as it can use a higher power.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 June 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5161757/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"10750414","publicationDate":"June 2009","conferenceDate":"21-24 June 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5161757/","dateOfInsertion":"10 July 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Outage margin and power constraints in cognitive radio with multiple antennas","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Outage margin and power constraints in cognitive radio with multiple antennas","confLoc":"Perugia, Italy","sourcePdf":"1569187086.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041141S","chronDate":"21-24 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5154399","isNumber":"5161729","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5154399","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"5161729","articleId":"5161757","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":5161758,"authors":[{"name":"Sergio Barbarossa","affiliation":["INFOCOM Department, University of Roma La Sapienza, Rome, Italy"],"firstName":"Sergio","lastName":"Barbarossa","id":"37269394800"},{"name":"Gesualdo Scutari","affiliation":["INFOCOM Department, University of Roma La Sapienza, Rome, Italy"],"firstName":"Gesualdo","lastName":"Scutari","id":"37269398400"},{"name":"Timothy Battisti","affiliation":["INFOCOM Department, University of Roma La Sapienza, Rome, Italy"],"firstName":"Timothy","lastName":"Battisti","id":"37571675100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3695-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3696-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1948-3244"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1948-3252"}],"articleNumber":"5161758","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":324},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cognitive radio","Projection algorithms","Receivers","Shadow mapping","Radio transmitters","Wideband","Iterative algorithms","Density measurement","Time measurement","Convergence"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","distributed sensors","iterative methods","radio receivers","radio transmitters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cooperative sensing","cognitive radio","decentralized projection algorithms","cognitive transmitter","power spectral density","primary receivers","spatial distribution","shadowing effects","iterative algorithm","MSE algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cognitive radio","wireless sensor networks","distributed projection algorithms"]}],"abstract":"Sensing the radio spectrum is an essential feature of cognitive radio. What is mostly important for a cognitive transmitter is to know the power spectral density at the location of its intended receiver and of the primary receivers. This requires, as a whole, knowledge of the spatial distribution of the power spectral density, an information that could be delivered by a network of sensors distributed over the territory, where each node estimates the local power spectral density and sends this information to a control node. The criticalities of this strategy are the limited sensing capabilities of the single node, shadowing effects and potential congestion around the sink nodes collecting all the estimated wideband spectra. In this paper, we propose a fully decentralized iterative algorithm allowing the network to project the measured spatial spectral density onto the useful signal subspace with the minimum convergence time. The idea is based on the assumption, typically valid in practice, that the spatial distribution of the power spectral density, for each frequency, is mostly concentrated over a vector space of dimension much smaller than the number of sensing nodes. The proposed technique yields a considerable reduction of estimation noise and undesired shadowing effects, without requiring the presence of a centralized control node. Interestingly, we show that in our set-up, the selection of the signal subspace dimension depends not only on the bias error and on the noise variance, as in any MSE algorithm, but also on the transmit power available at each node.","doi":"10.1109/SPAWC.2009.5161758","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 10th Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5154399/5161729/05161758.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5161729","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPAWC.2009.5161758","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 10th Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications","startPage":"116","endPage":"120","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cooperative sensing for cognitive radio using decentralized projection algorithms","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5161758","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"Cooperative sensing for cognitive radio using decentralized projection algorithms","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5161758/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5161758/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10750415","dateOfInsertion":"10 July 2009","conferenceDate":"21-24 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cooperative sensing for cognitive radio using decentralized projection algorithms","confLoc":"Perugia, Italy","sourcePdf":"1569187207.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078361S","chronDate":"21-24 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5154399","isNumber":"5161729","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5154399","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"5161729","articleId":"5161758","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5161759,"authors":[{"name":"Qiyue Zou","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, University of California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Qiyue Zou","id":"37269661300"},{"name":"Songfeng Zheng","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics, Missouri State University, Springfield, MO, USA"],"lastName":"Songfeng Zheng","id":"37404999800"},{"name":"Ali H.

This paper presents a cooperative sequential detection scheme to minimize the average sensing time that is required to reach a detection decision. In the scheme, each cognitive radio computes the Log-Likelihood ratio for its every measurement, and the base station sequentially accumulates these Log-Likelihood statistics and determines whether to stop making measurement. The average number of required samples depends on the Kullback-Leibler distance between the distributions of the two hypotheses under test. This suggests a criterion for selecting the most efficient radios to facilitate spectrum sensing. The paper also studies how to implement the scheme in a robust manner when the assumed statistical models have uncertainties. These ideas are illustrated through an example that assumes both the signal and noise are Gaussian distributed.","doi":"10.1109/SPAWC.2009.5161759","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 10th Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5154399/5161729/05161759.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5161729","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPAWC.2009.5161759","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 10th Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications","startPage":"121","endPage":"125","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cooperative spectrum sensing via sequential detection for cognitive radio networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5161759","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"Cooperative spectrum sensing via sequential detection for cognitive radio networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5161759/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5161759/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10750416","dateOfInsertion":"10 July 2009","conferenceDate":"21-24 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cooperative spectrum sensing via sequential detection for cognitive radio networks","confLoc":"Perugia, Italy","sourcePdf":"1569187354.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.092558S","chronDate":"21-24 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5154399","isNumber":"5161729","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5154399","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"5161729","articleId":"5161759","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5161760,"authors":[{"name":"Mylene Pischella","affiliation":["France Telecom Research and Development Division Issy les Moulineaux, France"],"firstName":"Mylene","lastName":"Pischella","id":"37541339900"},{"name":"Jean-Claude Belfiore","affiliation":["Department Comelec, ENST de Paris, France"],"firstName":"Jean-Claude","lastName":"Belfiore","id":"37284731700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3695-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3696-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1948-3244"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1948-3252"}],"articleNumber":"5161760","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":118},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resource management","MIMO","Transmitters","Channel state information","Base stations","Convergence","Power control","Capacity planning","Probability","Iterative methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","channel capacity","convex programming","frequency division multiple access","MIMO communication","OFDM modulation","power control","probability","resource allocation","telecommunication control","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed resource allocation","MIMO OFDMA multicell network","statistical channel state information","margin adaptive problem","distributed convergence criterion","power control","iterative power allocation","SNR","convex optimization problem","antenna configuration","power divergence situation","outage capacity"]}],"abstract":"This paper addresses the margin adaptive (MA) problem in MIMO OFDMA multi-cell networks, when the transmitter only has statistical channel state information.

The base station (BS) is equipped with multiple transmit antennas, and each user terminal is equipped with one or more receive antennas. We consider a stochastic error (SE) model and a norm-bounded error (NBE) model for the CSIT error. In the case of CSIT error following SE model, we compute the desired downlink precoder/receive filter matrices by solving the simpler uplink problem by exploiting the uplink-downlink duality for the MSE region. In the case of the CSIT error following the NBE model, we consider the worst-case SMSE as the objective function, and propose an iterative algorithm for the robust transceiver design. The robustness of the proposed algorithms to imperfections in CSIT is illustrated through simulations.","doi":"10.1109/SPAWC.2009.5161762","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 10th Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 10th Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5154399/5161729/05161762.pdf","startPage":"136","endPage":"140","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPAWC.2009.5161762","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5161729","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust joint precoder/receive filter designs for multiuser MIMO downlink","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5161762","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 June 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5161762/","displayDocTitle":"Robust joint precoder/receive filter designs for multiuser MIMO downlink","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10750417","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5161762/","conferenceDate":"21-24 June 2009","dateOfInsertion":"10 July 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust joint precoder/receive filter designs for multiuser MIMO downlink","confLoc":"Perugia, Italy","sourcePdf":"1569186874.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.083578S","chronDate":"21-24 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5154399","isNumber":"5161729","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5154399","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"5161729","articleId":"5161762","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5161763,"authors":[{"name":"Jouko Leinonen","affiliation":["Centre for Wireless Communications, University of Oulu, Oulu, Finland"],"firstName":"Jouko","lastName":"Leinonen","id":"37391298600"},{"name":"Jyri Hamalainen","affiliation":["Helsinki University of Technology, Finland"],"firstName":"Jyri","lastName":"Hamalainen","id":"37269110200"},{"name":"Markku Juntti","affiliation":["Centre for Wireless Communications, University of Oulu, Oulu, Finland"],"firstName":"Markku","lastName":"Juntti","id":"37269762200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3695-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3696-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1948-3244"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1948-3252"}],"articleNumber":"5161763","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":151},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Information analysis","Downlink","Radio spectrum management","Feedback","Resource management","MIMO","Frequency conversion","Wireless communication","Transmitting antennas","Block codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frequency allocation","information theory","MIMO communication","OFDM modulation","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["downlink MIMO-OFDMA frequency allocation","imperfect feedback information","opportunistic resource allocation","wireless communication networks","information theoretical capacity","optimal rate adaptation","transmit antenna selection","space-time block coding"]}],"abstract":"Opportunistic resource allocation in orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) and multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) techniques are among the key methods to enhance the spectral efficiency in future wireless communication networks.

Yet at the same time, the sum-rate with single-cell processing (SCP) is known to scale optimally with the number of users in a Rayleigh fading environment. One may therefore ask if the value of BS coordination is limited in the many user regime from a sum-rate perspective. With this in mind we consider multicell zero-forcing beamforming (ZFBF) on the downlink of a linear cell-array. We first identify the beamforming weights and the optimal scheduling policy under a perbase power constraint. We then compare the number of users m and n required per-cell to achieve the same mean SINR, after optimal scheduling, with SCP and ZFBF respectively. Specifically, we show that the ratio m/n grows logarithmically with n. Finally, we demonstrate that the difference in sum-rate between ZFBF and SCP is significant for all practical values of number of users.","pdfPath":"/iel5/5154399/5161729/05161767.pdf","startPage":"156","endPage":"160","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 10th Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5161729","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPAWC.2009.5161767","doi":"10.1109/SPAWC.2009.5161767","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 10th Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5161767","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Downlink","Optimal scheduling","Array signal processing","Signal to noise ratio","Base stations","Rayleigh channels","Wireless networks","Antenna arrays","Interchannel interference","Vectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","channel capacity","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multicell zero-forcing","user scheduling","linear cell-array","coordinated base station transmission","wireless networks","single-cell processing","Rayleigh fading","optimal scheduling"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 June 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5161767/","displayDocTitle":"Multicell zero-forcing and user scheduling on the downlink of a linear cell-array","accessionNumber":"10761913","dateOfInsertion":"10 July 2009","publicationDate":"June 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5161767/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"21-24 June 2009","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multicell zero-forcing and user scheduling on the downlink of a linear cell-array","confLoc":"Perugia, Italy","sourcePdf":"1569187482.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054819S","chronDate":"21-24 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5154399","isNumber":"5161729","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5154399","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"5161729","articleId":"5161767","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5161768,"authors":[{"name":"Andre Fonseca dos Santos","affiliation":["Vodafone Chair Mobile Communications Systems, Technische Universit\u00e4t Dresden, Dresden, Germany"],"firstName":"Andre Fonseca","lastName":"dos Santos","id":"38231414000"},{"name":"Wolfgang Rave","affiliation":["Vodafone Chair Mobile Communications Systems, Technische Universit\u00e4t Dresden, Dresden, Germany"],"firstName":"Wolfgang","lastName":"Rave","id":"37268328300"},{"name":"Gerhard Fettweis","affiliation":["Vodafone Chair Mobile Communications Systems, Technische Universit\u00e4t Dresden, Dresden, Germany"],"firstName":"Gerhard","lastName":"Fettweis","id":"37271859700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3695-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3696-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1948-3244"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1948-3252"}],"articleNumber":"5161768","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":28},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5161768","abstract":"We combine the characteristics of the Super Exponential (SE) method with Logic Strings and Second Order Statistics (SOS) to blindly estimate a multipath channel.

Existing equalizers for FBMC/OQAM do not completely cancel intercarrier interference (ICI) and hence some ICI remains even after equalization. To cope more efficiently with ICI, we propose a two stage MMSE (TS-MMSE) equalizer. The first stage consists in applying an MMSE equalizer and taking some preliminary decisions, then subsequetly using these decisions to remove the term corresponding to ICI from the received signal for each subchannel. The resulting signal from the first stage has its ICI practically removed (up to channel estimation errors and decision errors) and is therefore corrupted only by intersymbol interference (ISI) and additive noise. In the second stage we apply an MMSE equalizer which copes only with ISI. The proposed two stage MMSE equalizer has shown better performance compared to the classical MMSE one. Some simulation results are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed equalizer.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 10th Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5154399/5161729/05161772.pdf","startPage":"186","endPage":"190","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 10th Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/SPAWC.2009.5161772","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPAWC.2009.5161772","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5161729","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5161772","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An enhanced MMSE per subchannel equalizer for highly frequency selective channels for FBMC/OQAM systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Equalizers","Intersymbol interference","OFDM modulation","Digital video broadcasting","Frequency domain analysis","Time frequency analysis","Pulse shaping methods","Remote sensing","Laboratories","Electronic mail"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","equalisers","frequency selective surfaces","intercarrier interference","intersymbol interference","least mean squares methods","OFDM modulation","quadrature amplitude modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MMSE","subchannel equalizer","frequency selective channels","FBMC/OQAM systems","filter bank","multicarrier modulation","intercarrier interference cancellation","ICI","TS-MMSE","channel estimation errors","decision errors","intersymbol interference","additive noise"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5161772/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"An enhanced MMSE per subchannel equalizer for highly frequency selective channels for FBMC/OQAM systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5161772/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10750423","dateOfInsertion":"10 July 2009","conferenceDate":"21-24 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An enhanced MMSE per subchannel equalizer for highly frequency selective channels for FBMC/OQAM systems","confLoc":"Perugia, Italy","sourcePdf":"1569187368.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054168S","chronDate":"21-24 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5154399","isNumber":"5161729","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5154399","citationCount":"32","xplore-issue":"5161729","articleId":"5161772","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5161773,"authors":[{"name":"Rafael Boloix-Tortosa","affiliation":["DTSC en Universidad de Sevilla, Paseo de los Descubrimientos s/n, Seville, Spain"],"firstName":"Rafael","lastName":"Boloix-Tortosa","id":"38274404600"},{"name":"Franciso J.

This can be taken advantage of when estimating the unknown channel frequency response using pilot assisted modulation. Other work has largely focused on the greedy orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) algorithm, using a dictionary based on an equivalent finite impulse response filter to model the channel. This is not necessarily realistic, as the physical nature of the channel is continuous in time, while the equivalent filter taps are based on baseband sampling. In this paper, we consider sparse channel estimation using a continuous time path-based channel model. This can be linked to the direction finding problem from the array processing literature and solved using the well-known root-MUSIC and ESPRIT algorithms, which have no formal time resolution. In addition, we show that a dictionary with finer time resolution considerably improves the performance of OMP and the related Basis Pursuit (BP) algorithm.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sparse channel estimation for OFDM: Over-complete dictionaries and super-resolution","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 10th Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/SPAWC.2009.5161774","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 10th Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5154399/5161729/05161774.pdf","startPage":"196","endPage":"200","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPAWC.2009.5161774","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5161729","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5161774","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5161774/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"Sparse channel estimation for OFDM: Over-complete dictionaries and super-resolution","conferenceDate":"21-24 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5161774/","dateOfInsertion":"10 July 2009","publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10750424","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sparse channel estimation for OFDM: Over-complete dictionaries and super-resolution","confLoc":"Perugia, Italy","sourcePdf":"1569187442.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072811S","chronDate":"21-24 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5154399","isNumber":"5161729","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5154399","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"5161729","articleId":"5161774","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5161775,"authors":[{"name":"Samir-Mohamad Omar","affiliation":["Mobile Communications Department, Eurecom Institute, Sophia-Antipolis, France"],"firstName":"Samir-Mohamad","lastName":"Omar","id":"37410970900"},{"name":"Dirk T.M.

Most existing such techniques for frequency-selective channels are quite complex. In this paper, we consider the blind channel estimation problem for Single Input Multi Output (SIMO) cyclic prefix (CP) systems. We have shown before that blind channel estimation becomes computationally much more attractive and more straight forward to analyze in terms of performance in CP systems. Inspired by the iterative sample covariance matrix (SCM) structure enhancement techniques of Cadzow and others, we propose here an algorithm to structure the sample block circulant covariance matrix by enforcing two essential properties: rank and FIR structure. These two properties are exhibited by the true covariance matrix in the case of FIR SIMO channels with spatially white noise and CP transmission. The proposed enhancement procedure leads to an interesting enhanced SCM, even for the single CP symbol case. A simulation study for some classical channel estimators that depend on the SCM (with and without structuring) is presented, indicating that structuring allows for considerable performance gain in terms of the channel normalized mean square error (NMSE) over a wide SNR range.","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 10th Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 10th Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5154399/5161729/05161775.pdf","startPage":"201","endPage":"205","doi":"10.1109/SPAWC.2009.5161775","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPAWC.2009.5161775","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5161729","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Structured spatio-temporal sample covariance matrix enhancement with application to blind channel estimation in cyclic prefix systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5161775/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"Structured spatio-temporal sample covariance matrix enhancement with application to blind channel estimation in cyclic prefix systems","htmlLink":"/document/5161775/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","dateOfInsertion":"10 July 2009","accessionNumber":"10750425","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"21-24 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Structured spatio-temporal sample covariance matrix enhancement with application to blind channel estimation in cyclic prefix systems","confLoc":"Perugia, Italy","sourcePdf":"1569187759.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059609S","chronDate":"21-24 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5154399","isNumber":"5161729","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5154399","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5161729","articleId":"5161775","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5161776,"authors":[{"name":"Melvin C.

Within the framework of the power minimization problem, two Joint Power Control and Optimal Beamforming (JPCOB) algorithms have already been proposed in previous works. However, one of the major challenges associated with network coordination is the design of algorithms which result in low-complexity requirements as the number of users increases. In this paper, one of the previous JPCOB algorithms is modified in order to obtain a low-complexity solution by reducing the amount of feedback required from single antenna users in the system. The performance of this algorithm is then compared with the previous JPCOB solutions. Simulation results in a W-CDMA scenario show that the low-complexity algorithm equals the performance of the previous solutions for a given number of coordinated base stations. However, it suffers a severe penalty for scenarios with high SINR requirements at the users. In order to overcome this drawback, two iterative schemes based on the particular structure of the matrices involved in the power control updating step are proposed. Moreover, these schemes could be seen as efficient and computationally simple scheduling techniques.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A low-complexity joint power control and beamforming algorithm for the downlink of multi-user W-CDMA coordinated systems","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 10th Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/SPAWC.2009.5161780","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 10th Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5154399/5161729/05161780.pdf","startPage":"226","endPage":"230","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPAWC.2009.5161780","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5161729","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5161780","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5161780/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"A low-complexity joint power control and beamforming algorithm for the downlink of multi-user W-CDMA coordinated systems","conferenceDate":"21-24 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5161780/","dateOfInsertion":"10 July 2009","publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10750426","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A low-complexity joint power control and beamforming algorithm for the downlink of multi-user W-CDMA coordinated systems","confLoc":"Perugia, Italy","sourcePdf":"1569187322.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058569S","chronDate":"21-24 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5154399","isNumber":"5161729","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5154399","xplore-issue":"5161729","articleId":"5161780","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5161782,"authors":[{"name":"Shreeram Sigdel","affiliation":["University of Alberta, TRLaboratories, Edmonton, Canada"],"firstName":"Shreeram","lastName":"Sigdel","id":"37294427900"},{"name":"Witold A.

With SZF, an optimization of sum rate maximizing transmit covariance matrices is necessary. A dirty paper coding (DPC) based transmit covariance matrix optimization algorithm has been recently proposed. The algorithm involves three steps: the dual multiple access channel (MAC) covariance optimization using sum power iterative water-filling, the MAC to broadcast channel (BC) covariance transformation for DPC, and transformation of the DPC downlink covariance matrices to SZF matrices. Hence, that algorithm is computationally very complex, and may not be realizable in practice. In this paper, we propose a suboptimal but much simplified algorithm, which employs an iterative procedure similar to the MAC covariance optimization technique, but does not involve multiple levels of covariance matrix transformations. Additionally, the optimized algorithm requires the optimization to be applied to all possible user orders. Hence, we propose a heuristic user ordering algorithm based on previously proposed user selection algorithms, so that the exhaustive search through all possible user orders is avoided without significant performance penalty. Simulation results show that proposed algorithm performs very close to the algorithm of in low SNR regime.","pdfPath":"/iel5/5154399/5161729/05161782.pdf","startPage":"235","endPage":"239","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 10th Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5161729","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPAWC.2009.5161782","doi":"10.1109/SPAWC.2009.5161782","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 10th Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5161782","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Iterative algorithms","Covariance matrix","MIMO","Downlink","Base stations","Mobile antennas","Receiving antennas","Transmitting antennas","Broadcasting","Heuristic algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["broadcast channels","channel coding","covariance matrices","MIMO communication","mobile radio","multiuser channels","optimisation","precoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["transmit covariance matrix optimization algorithm","successive zero-forcing precoding","multiuser multiple-input multiple-output downlink","mobile receivers","multiple antennas","dirty paper coding","dual multiple access channel","broadcast channel","matrix transformation","heuristic user ordering algorithm","exhaustive search"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 June 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5161782/","displayDocTitle":"Simplified transmit covariance optimization and user ordering algorithm for successive zero-forcing precoding","accessionNumber":"10750428","dateOfInsertion":"10 July 2009","publicationDate":"June 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5161782/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"21-24 June 2009","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Simplified transmit covariance optimization and user ordering algorithm for successive zero-forcing precoding","confLoc":"Perugia, Italy","sourcePdf":"1569187390.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052254S","chronDate":"21-24 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5154399","isNumber":"5161729","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5154399","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5161729","articleId":"5161782","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":5161785,"authors":[{"name":"Veria Havary-Nassab","affiliation":["Department Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Toronto, Toronto, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Veria","lastName":"Havary-Nassab","id":"38270688500"},{"name":"Shahram Shahbazpanahi","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering and Applied Science, University of Ontario Institute of Technology (UOIT), Oshawa, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Shahram","lastName":"Shahbazpanahi","id":"37273468400"},{"name":"Ali Grami","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering and Applied Science, University of Ontario Institute of Technology (UOIT), Oshawa, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Ali","lastName":"Grami","id":"37284153600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3695-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3696-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1948-3244"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1948-3252"}],"articleNumber":"5161785","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":286},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Transceivers","Array signal processing","Signal processing","Transmitters","Broadcasting","Bandwidth","Educational institutions","Computational complexity","Collaboration"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","computational complexity","iterative methods","transceivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["relay network","two-way amplify-and-phase-adjust relaying","relay nodes","distributed beamforming","linear computational complexity","power allocation","signal-to-noise ratio balancing"]}],"abstract":"We consider a relay network which consists of two transceivers and r relay nodes.

In this scheme, each relay multiplies its received signal by a complex weight and transmits the so-obtained signal thereby participating in a distributed beamforming process. We deploy an SNR balancing technique where the smallest of the two transceiver SNRs is maximized while the total transmit power is kept below a certain power budget. We show that this problem has a unique solution which can be obtained through an iterative procedure with a linear computational complexity per iteration. We also prove that for any channel realization, this approach leads to a power allocation scheme where half of the maximum power budget is allocated to the two transceivers and the remaining half will be shared among all the relay nodes. We further devise a distributed implementation of our proposed scheme which requires a minimal cooperation among the two transceivers and the relays. In fact, we show that our technique can be implemented such that the bandwidth required to obtain the beamforming weights in a distributed manner remains constant as the size of the network grows.","doi":"10.1109/SPAWC.2009.5161785","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 10th Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5154399/5161729/05161785.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5161729","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPAWC.2009.5161785","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 10th Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications","startPage":"250","endPage":"254","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An SNR balancing approach to two-way relaying","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5161785","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"An SNR balancing approach to two-way relaying","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5161785/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5161785/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10761923","dateOfInsertion":"10 July 2009","conferenceDate":"21-24 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An SNR balancing approach to two-way relaying","confLoc":"Perugia, Italy","sourcePdf":"1569185976.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055942S","chronDate":"21-24 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5154399","isNumber":"5161729","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5154399","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5161729","articleId":"5161785","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5161789,"authors":[{"name":"L.

Space-time non-regenerative relaying aids to keep the relay hardware simple and cheap. Accurate estimates for the channel and carrier frequency offset (CFO) are required by the receiver to reap the benefits from relaying. In this paper, we propose a training frame format for relay transmission and formulate a subspace based CFO and channel estimator. The estimation problem is shown to be similar to the joint CFO and channel estimation in a multiuser uplink system.

Both amplify-and-forward and decode-and-forward protocols are studied. Fundamentally, a relay can operate either in a full-duplex or in a half-duplex mode. The performance in full-duplex relaying is degraded due to loop interference from the relay output to the relay input. On the other hand, the half-duplex mode eliminates the loop interference, but this reduces the end-to-end rate. In this paper, we study the feasibility of the full-duplex mode in terms of end-to-end capacity. In particular, we evaluate break-even loop interference levels, below which the full-duplex mode outperforms the half-duplex mode. The analysis shows that the full-duplex mode is feasible in the presence of reasonably high loop interference power and can offer higher capacity than the half-duplex mode.","doi":"10.1109/SPAWC.2009.5161790","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 10th Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 10th Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5154399/5161729/05161790.pdf","startPage":"275","endPage":"279","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPAWC.2009.5161790","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5161729","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the feasibility of full-duplex relaying in the presence of loop interference","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5161790","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 June 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5161790/","displayDocTitle":"On the feasibility of full-duplex relaying in the presence of loop interference","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10750432","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5161790/","conferenceDate":"21-24 June 2009","dateOfInsertion":"10 July 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the feasibility of full-duplex relaying in the presence of loop interference","confLoc":"Perugia, Italy","sourcePdf":"1569187072.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075568S","chronDate":"21-24 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5154399","isNumber":"5161729","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5154399","citationCount":"120","xplore-issue":"5161729","articleId":"5161790","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5161791,"authors":[{"name":"Jingon Joung","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Jingon","lastName":"Joung","id":"37289977300"},{"name":"Ali H.

Both techniques can be used to increase the link throughput and/or to improve its robustness against channel fading and noise. This paper presents a unified bit error rate analysis for a particular flavour of multicarrier, namely, group-orthogonal code-division multiplex (GO-CDM), in combination with multiple Tx/Rx antennas. This system can be shown to encompass many of current wireless architectures and the analysis is general enough to incorporate the effects of channel frequency selectivity and Tx and/or Rx antenna correlation. The main outcome of this paper is a general analytical framework suitable to study the effects of the different types of diversity in multicarrier systems. More particularly, it is shown how GO-CDM can play an important role in improving the performance of MIMO-OFDM systems.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 10th Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5154399/5161729/05161793.pdf","startPage":"290","endPage":"294","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 10th Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/SPAWC.2009.5161793","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPAWC.2009.5161793","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5161729","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5161793","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MIMO group-orthogonal code-division multiplex: A unified treatment of diversity in multicarrier systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Code division multiplexing","Receiving antennas","Wireless communication","Throughput","Noise robustness","Fading","Bit error rate","Error analysis","Frequency"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","diversity reception","error statistics","fading channels","MIMO communication","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO group-orthogonal code-division multiplex system","multiple input multiple output system","diversity reception","wireless communication","fading channel","bit error rate analysis","multiple transmit-receive antenna","OFDM system","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5161793/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"MIMO group-orthogonal code-division multiplex: A unified treatment of diversity in multicarrier systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5161793/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10761926","dateOfInsertion":"10 July 2009","conferenceDate":"21-24 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MIMO group-orthogonal code-division multiplex: A unified treatment of diversity in multicarrier systems","confLoc":"Perugia, Italy","sourcePdf":"1569181392.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.093314S","chronDate":"21-24 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5154399","isNumber":"5161729","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5154399","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5161729","articleId":"5161793","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5161794,"authors":[{"name":"Rizwan Ghaffar","affiliation":["Eurecom Institute, Sophia-Antipolis, France"],"firstName":"Rizwan","lastName":"Ghaffar","id":"37392200900"},{"name":"Raymond Knopp","affiliation":["Eurecom Institute, Sophia-Antipolis, France"],"firstName":"Raymond","lastName":"Knopp","id":"37283390500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3695-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3696-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1948-3244"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1948-3252"}],"articleNumber":"5161794","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":162},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Fading","Transmitting antennas","Maximum likelihood detection","Interleaved codes","Modulation coding","OFDM modulation","Antenna arrays","Detection algorithms","Detectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fading channels","interleaved codes","MIMO communication","OFDM modulation","space division multiplexing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low complexity soft detection","spatially multiplexed BICM MIMO OFDM system","multiple input multiple output channels","fading channels","bit interleaved coded modulation system","serial-to parallel conversion","antenna coding","antenna array","MMSE linear detectors","zero forcing detectors","max log MAP detection"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents a new approach to soft detection of spatial data streams in multiple input multiple output (MIMO) channels in slow fading channels. We focus on high spectral efficiency bit interleaved coded modulation (BICM) MIMO OFDM system where, after serial to parallel conversion and per antenna coding, spatial data streams are simultaneously transmitted by using an antenna array. We propose a detection algorithm based on a combination of linear and non linear detection techniques. The proposed algorithm orders spatial streams as per V-BLAST ordering and then uses linear detectors like MMSE or zero forcing (ZF) to detect the streams which have seen good channel realizations and therefore enjoy higher signal-to-noise-ratios (SNRs). These streams, after being detected, are subsequently stripped off leading to max log MAP detection of the streams which have seen comparatively poor realizations of the channel and consequently have lower SNRs. Unlike maximum likelihood (ML) detection, whose complexity is huge due to the need for enumerating all possible combinations of the transmitted constellation points, the proposed method has low complexity and moreover has a fully parallel structure suitable for the implementation in parallel hardware. Numerical examples illustrate the performance of proposed algorithm for slow fading 3times3 and 4times4 complex MIMO channels in comparison to linear and max log MAP detection.","doi":"10.1109/SPAWC.2009.5161794","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 10th Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 10th Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5154399/5161729/05161794.pdf","startPage":"295","endPage":"299","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPAWC.2009.5161794","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5161729","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low complexity soft detection for spatially multiplexed BICM MIMO OFDM system","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5161794","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 June 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5161794/","displayDocTitle":"Low complexity soft detection for spatially multiplexed BICM MIMO OFDM system","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10761927","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5161794/","conferenceDate":"21-24 June 2009","dateOfInsertion":"10 July 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low complexity soft detection for spatially multiplexed BICM MIMO OFDM system","confLoc":"Perugia, Italy","sourcePdf":"1569187037.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062955S","chronDate":"21-24 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5154399","isNumber":"5161729","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5154399","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5161729","articleId":"5161794","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5161795,"authors":[{"name":"Hao Lin","affiliation":["France Telecom, Orange Laboratories, Cesson-Sevigne, France"],"firstName":"Hao","lastName":"Lin","id":"37405075900"},{"name":"Chrislin Lele","affiliation":["France Telecom, Orange Laboratories, Cesson-Sevigne, France"],"firstName":"Chrislin","lastName":"Lele","id":"37571575700"},{"name":"Pierre Siohan","affiliation":["France Telecom, Orange Laboratories, Cesson-Sevigne, France"],"firstName":"Pierre","lastName":"Siohan","id":"37293775600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3695-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3696-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1948-3244"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1948-3252"}],"articleNumber":"5161795","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":325},"abstract":"Multi-carrier modulation (MCM) and especially orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) are currently used in many radio transmission standards.

Moreover, we identify and characterize three types of diversity resulting from the BID scheme: modulation diversity, multiplexing diversity, and interference decorrelation resulting in an enhanced detection performance. By using a distance spectrum analysis, we evaluate their respective importance according to the used modulation and the transmission scenario. Some interleaving design rules are given in order to enhance further the overall transmission diversity.

Despite its obvious advantages, the limitations of the analog combining architecture makes necessary to develop specific transmission schemes. For instance, in the case of perfect channel state information (CSI) at the receiver, and correlation CSI at the transmitter, the space and time encoders must operate separately (the former works in the RF domain and the latter works in baseband), and at different time scales: the spatial encoder or RF beamformer must remain fixed during the transmission of a probably large number of symbols, whereas the time encoder can work at the symbol rate. In this paper we propose a transmission scheme for this scenario with the goal of minimizing the pairwise error probability (PEP). In particular, with the proposed scheme the symbols are time-precoded with a unitary discrete Fourier transform (DFT) matrix, and then are successively transmitted using a set of RF weights (beamformers). The optimal spatial precoding matrix containing the RF beamformers is obtained by matching its left eigenspace with the eigenspace of the channel correlation matrix, applying standard power water-filling along these directions, and choosing its right eigenspace as any unitary matrix with unit-norm elements such as the DFT matrix. Numerical examples illustrate the good performance of the proposed scheme.","doi":"10.1109/SPAWC.2009.5161802","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 10th Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 10th Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5154399/5161729/05161802.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPAWC.2009.5161802","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5161729","startPage":"334","endPage":"338","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal precoding for a novel RF-MIMO scheme in transmit correlated Rayleigh channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5161802","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Optimal precoding for a novel RF-MIMO scheme in transmit correlated Rayleigh channels","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 June 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5161802/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"21-24 June 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10761932","dateOfInsertion":"10 July 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5161802/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal precoding for a novel RF-MIMO scheme in transmit correlated Rayleigh channels","confLoc":"Perugia, Italy","sourcePdf":"1569180025.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050333S","chronDate":"21-24 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5154399","isNumber":"5161729","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5154399","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5161729","articleId":"5161802","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":5161803,"authors":[{"name":"Helka-Liina Maattanen","affiliation":["Helsinki University of Technology, Finland"],"firstName":"Helka-Liina","lastName":"Maattanen","id":"37403586000"},{"name":"Olav Tirkkonen","affiliation":["Nokia Research Center, Finland","Helsinki University of Technology, Finland"],"firstName":"Olav","lastName":"Tirkkonen","id":"38269504600"},{"name":"Timo Roman","affiliation":["Nokia Devices Research and Development, Finland"],"firstName":"Timo","lastName":"Roman","id":"37272352400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3695-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3696-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1948-3244"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1948-3252"}],"articleNumber":"5161803","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":178},"abstract":"In this paper we reduce the feedback overhead in two-stream MIMO with per stream link adaptation and codebook based precoding. The amount of feedback may be reduced by indicating the CQI of one stream in a differential manner. The performance of the system depends on how the differential feedback is designed. We optimize the differential feedback for the weaker data stream by considering an optimum differential quantization between the streams. The off-set CQI values for the weaker stream are found by maximizing the throughput on the weaker data stream using the distribution of the difference between the post processing SINR values of the streams. The SINR difference distribution is found in semi-analytic form for 2 times 2 MIMO with codebook based precoding and a linear receiver. The offset values are calculated for both i.i.d. and correlated flat Rayleigh fading channels for a given number of relative feedback bits.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 10th Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5154399/5161729/05161803.pdf","startPage":"339","endPage":"343","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 10th Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/SPAWC.2009.5161803","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPAWC.2009.5161803","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5161729","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5161803","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Differential CQI optimization for MIMO with codebook based precoding","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Feedback","Signal to noise ratio","Throughput","Fading","Quantization","Transmitters","Modulation coding","Signal processing","Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel coding","MIMO communication","optimisation","precoding","quantisation (signal)","Rayleigh channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO channel","differential CQI optimization","codebook","precoding","link adaptation","differential feedback","weaker data stream","optimum differential quantization","SINR value","linear receiver","correlated flat Rayleigh fading channel","channel quality indicator"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5161803/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"Differential CQI optimization for MIMO with codebook based precoding","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5161803/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10761933","dateOfInsertion":"10 July 2009","conferenceDate":"21-24 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Differential CQI optimization for MIMO with codebook based precoding","confLoc":"Perugia, Italy","sourcePdf":"1569186246.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045848S","chronDate":"21-24 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5154399","isNumber":"5161729","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5154399","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5161729","articleId":"5161803","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5161804,"authors":[{"name":"Amitav Mukherjee","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering & Computer Science, University of California, Irvine, Irvine, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Amitav","lastName":"Mukherjee","id":"37291343600"},{"name":"A.

A portion of the transmit power is used to broadcast the information signal with just enough power to guarantee a certain data rate for the intended receiver, and the remainder of the power is used to broadcast artificial noise in order to mask the desired signal from a potential eavesdropper. The interference is designed to be orthogonal to the multiple-stream information signal when it reaches the desired receiver. A modified water-filling algorithm is proposed that balances the required transmit power with the number of spatial dimensions available for jamming the eavesdropper. Numerical results verify the increase in secrecy capacity under the proposed transmission scheme.","doi":"10.1109/SPAWC.2009.5161804","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 10th Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 10th Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5154399/5161729/05161804.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPAWC.2009.5161804","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5161729","startPage":"344","endPage":"348","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fixed-rate power allocation strategies for enhanced secrecy in MIMO wiretap channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5161804","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Fixed-rate power allocation strategies for enhanced secrecy in MIMO wiretap channels","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 June 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5161804/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"21-24 June 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10761934","dateOfInsertion":"10 July 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5161804/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fixed-rate power allocation strategies for enhanced secrecy in MIMO wiretap channels","confLoc":"Perugia, Italy","sourcePdf":"1569186195.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051152S","chronDate":"21-24 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5154399","isNumber":"5161729","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5154399","citationCount":"38","xplore-issue":"5161729","articleId":"5161804","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5161807,"authors":[{"name":"Ki-Hong Park","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Korea University, South Korea"],"firstName":"Ki-Hong","lastName":"Park","id":"37539842400"},{"name":"Young-Chai Ko","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Korea University, South Korea"],"firstName":"Young-Chai","lastName":"Ko","id":"37279007700"},{"name":"Mohamed-Slim Alouini","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Program, Texas A and M University, Qatar, Qatar"],"firstName":"Mohamed-Slim","lastName":"Alouini","id":"37274291900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3695-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3696-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1948-3244"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1948-3252"}],"articleNumber":"5161807","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":67},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Transmitting antennas","OFDM","Transmitters","Feedback","Antenna feeds","Intersymbol interference","Peak to average power ratio","Power amplifiers","Degradation","Optimization methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","channel allocation","fading channels","OFDM modulation","optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low-complexity multiple transmit antenna selection","power balancing constraint","multiple-input single-output OFDM system","multicarrier system","fixed-power variable-rate transmission","fading channel variation","optimal antenna selection scheme","numerical optimization","subcarrier imbalance","two-step reallocation procedure","spectral efficiency"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we consider multi-carrier systems with multiple transmit antennas under a power balancing constraint.

In contrast to the implicit assumption of rich multipath in the prevalent i.i.d. MIMO fading model, recent investigations and measurement campaigns have shown that physical channels exhibit a sparse multipath structure that in turn leads to spatial correlation. Using a set of measured data and a wellknown analytical model, the measured MIMO channel matrix is decomposed in terms of fixed virtual transmit and receive angles, thereby providing a simple geometric interpretation of the scattering environment. It is demonstrated that the presence of direct or obstructed Line-of-Sight (LoS) components strongly correlates with channel sparsity; consequently, the number of spatial degrees of freedom (DoF) is severely limited compared to that in the i.i.d. model. In the sequel, we investigate the relationship between the channel sparsity structure and the mean of propagation paths and quantify the impact of channel sparsity on two key MIMO channel metrics: ergodic capacity and diversity level. In all cases, the analysis of measured data reveals an approximate concave quadratic variation in capacity, diversity and mean number of paths as a function of the number of DoF, thereby suggesting a fundamental inter-dependency between all these features.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 10th Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5154399/5161729/05161808.pdf","startPage":"364","endPage":"368","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 10th Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/SPAWC.2009.5161808","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPAWC.2009.5161808","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5161729","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5161808","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sparse multipath MIMO channels: Performance implications based on measurement data","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Scattering","Data analysis","Fading","Channel capacity","Antenna measurements","Video recording","Symmetric matrices","Electric variables measurement","Circuit theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel capacity","MIMO communication","sparse matrices","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sparse multipath MIMO channels","statistical assessment","channel sparsity"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5161808/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"Sparse multipath MIMO channels: Performance implications based on measurement data","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5161808/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10750438","dateOfInsertion":"10 July 2009","conferenceDate":"21-24 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sparse multipath MIMO channels: Performance implications based on measurement data","confLoc":"Perugia, Italy","sourcePdf":"1569187106.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.089961S","chronDate":"21-24 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5154399","isNumber":"5161729","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5154399","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"5161729","articleId":"5161808","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5161810,"authors":[{"name":"Christian Guthy","affiliation":["Associate Institute for Signal Processing, Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen, Munchen, Germany"],"firstName":"Christian","lastName":"Guthy","id":"37294594500"},{"name":"Alexander Krebs","affiliation":["Associate Institute for Signal Processing, Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen, Munchen, Germany"],"firstName":"Alexander","lastName":"Krebs","id":"37584327400"},{"name":"Wolfgang Utschick","affiliation":["Associate Institute for Signal Processing, Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen, Munchen, Germany"],"firstName":"Wolfgang","lastName":"Utschick","id":"37273316200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3695-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3696-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1948-3244"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1948-3252"}],"articleNumber":"5161810","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":44},"abstract":"By using perfect Channel State Information (CSI) at the transmitter significant gains in terms of sum rate can be obtained in the Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) broadcast channel.

This paper addresses the problem of maximizing the transmission capacity of an ad-hoc network when each node is equipped with multiple antennas. Bounds on the transmission capacity are derived as a function of the number of antennas used for transmission, and the number of antennas used for interference cancellation. Both the transmitter and receiver are assumed to have channel state information (CSI). CSI at the transmitter is used to transmit multiple streams using multi-mode precoding, while CSI at the receiver is used for interference cancellation. Canceling the strongest or the closest interferers, single stream transmission on the best eigenmode together with using all but one receiver antennas for interference cancellation is shown to maximize the transmission capacity.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5161816/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 June 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"21-24 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","dateOfInsertion":"10 July 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5161816/","accessionNumber":"10761942","displayDocTitle":"Transmission capacity of wireless ad-hoc networks with multiple antennas using multi-mode precoding and interference cancelation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Transmission capacity of wireless ad-hoc networks with multiple antennas using multi-mode precoding and interference cancelation","confLoc":"Perugia, Italy","sourcePdf":"1569187386.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063413S","chronDate":"21-24 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5154399","isNumber":"5161729","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5154399","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5161729","articleId":"5161816","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5161822,"authors":[{"name":"Yuan-Pei Lin","affiliation":["Department Electrical and Control Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yuan-Pei","lastName":"Lin","id":"37279529400"},{"name":"Yi-De Liu","affiliation":["Department Electrical and Control Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yi-De","lastName":"Liu","id":"37537587000"},{"name":"See-May Phoong","affiliation":["Department of EE Graduate Institute of Comm Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"See-May","lastName":"Phoong","id":"37266374400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3695-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3696-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1948-3244"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1948-3252"}],"articleNumber":"5161822","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":62},"abstract":"In this paper, we propose an efficient algorithm for finding the minimum sampling frequency for a signal that consists of two bandpass signals.

In order to prevent nonlinear distortions the PAPR needs to be minimized to guarantee a linear dynamic range of the high power amplifier. Therefore, various reduction algorithms have been proposed. However, they do not include link adaptation requirements. Previous results show that bit and power loading algorithms in adaptive OFDM systems fail to meet the target error rate requirements if large time-domain peaks occur. Hence, in this paper a joint utilization of extended constellation alphabets of active subcarriers and tone reservation for peak power reduction in adaptive OFDM systems is derived. The resulting linear programming (LP) problem can be efficiently solved and the solution is lossless in terms of throughput. Furthermore, a sub-optimal algorithm, which achieves great PAPR reduction with lower complexity, is proposed while link adaptation is employed.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint constellation extension and tone reservation for PAPR reduction in adaptive OFDM systems","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 10th Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/SPAWC.2009.5161823","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 10th Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5154399/5161729/05161823.pdf","startPage":"439","endPage":"443","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPAWC.2009.5161823","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5161729","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5161823","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5161823/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"Joint constellation extension and tone reservation for PAPR reduction in adaptive OFDM systems","conferenceDate":"21-24 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5161823/","dateOfInsertion":"10 July 2009","publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10761945","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint constellation extension and tone reservation for PAPR reduction in adaptive OFDM systems","confLoc":"Perugia, Italy","sourcePdf":"1569185997.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05598S","chronDate":"21-24 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5154399","isNumber":"5161729","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5154399","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5161729","articleId":"5161823","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5161824,"authors":[{"name":"Jovana Ilic","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering; Department of Mathematics, University of California,\uc2a0Davis, USA"],"firstName":"Jovana","lastName":"Ilic","id":"37396004500"},{"name":"Thomas Strohmer","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering; Department of Mathematics, University of California,\uc2a0Davis, USA"],"firstName":"Thomas","lastName":"Strohmer","id":"37269791900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3695-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3696-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1948-3244"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1948-3252"}],"articleNumber":"5161824","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":288},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Peak to average power ratio","OFDM","Signal processing","Uncertainty","Numerical simulation","Mathematics","Iterative algorithms","Signal design","Iterative methods","Upper bound"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convergence of numerical methods","iterative methods","OFDM modulation","sparse matrices"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["PAPR reduction","peak to average power ratio","Kashin's representation","subcarrier reservation","sparse signals","iterative method","OFDM signals","convergence rates","numerical simulations"]}],"abstract":"A major drawback of OFDM is its large peak to average power ratio (PAPR).

It is shown that the former two problems are non-convex but they can be solved accurately and efficiently using the standard semidefinite relaxation and randomization techniques. However, the last problem can be reformulated into a second-order cone programming (SOCP) problem.

We investigate the effectiveness of the proposed solution by comparing the achieved outage probabilities with those obtained through global numerical search. We find that the simple closed-form solution is almost optimal in many situations of interest and even at low SNR conditions. We observe that power-optimized IR needs significantly less power than power-optimized fixed relaying to achieve the same outage probability at the same effective rate.

Such a randomized MIMO-OFDM code renders the encoding/decoding rule independent of the number of actual BSs cooperating and works without any channel feedback, which greatly simplifies the protocol as well as the MS design. Both analytical and numerical results show the performance gain and the coverage expansion attainable.","doi":"10.1109/SPAWC.2009.5161837","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 10th Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 10th Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5154399/5161729/05161837.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPAWC.2009.5161837","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5161729","startPage":"509","endPage":"513","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Expanding cell coverage in cooperative base station systems by means of randomized MIMO-OFDM coding","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5161837","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Expanding cell coverage in cooperative base station systems by means of randomized MIMO-OFDM coding","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 June 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5161837/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"21-24 June 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10750452","dateOfInsertion":"10 July 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5161837/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Expanding cell coverage in cooperative base station systems by means of randomized MIMO-OFDM coding","confLoc":"Perugia, Italy","sourcePdf":"1569183918.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.089881S","chronDate":"21-24 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5154399","isNumber":"5161729","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5154399","xplore-issue":"5161729","articleId":"5161837","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5161839,"authors":[{"name":"Mohammed F.

It is based on the fact that the distributed nodes of a WSN can synchronize their carrier phases to form a beampattern with a stable mainlobe (independent on the node locations). However, sidelobes of such beampattern are found to be severely dependent on the particular node locations. High level sidelobes can cause unacceptable interference to unintended base stations and access points (BSs/APs). Therefore, controlling the sidelobes of CB has the potential to increase the network capacity and wireless channel availability. In this paper, we propose node selection for CB sidelobe control. A selection algorithm with low implementation complexity is developed to search over different node combinations. It aims at minimizing the interference at unintended BSs/APs. The performance of the proposed algorithm is analyzed in terms of the average number of trials and the achieved interference suppression. Simulation results match the analytical approximations and show the effectiveness of node selection for limiting the interference.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPAWC.2009.5161839","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5161729","startPage":"519","endPage":"523","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 10th Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5154399/5161729/05161839.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Node selection for sidelobe control in collaborative beamforming for wireless sensor networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5161839/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 June 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5161839/","displayDocTitle":"Node selection for sidelobe control in collaborative beamforming for wireless sensor networks","conferenceDate":"21-24 June 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10750454","dateOfInsertion":"10 July 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Node selection for sidelobe control in collaborative beamforming for wireless sensor networks","confLoc":"Perugia, Italy","sourcePdf":"1569187032.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047792S","chronDate":"21-24 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5154399","isNumber":"5161729","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5154399","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"5161729","articleId":"5161839","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5161842,"authors":[{"name":"Chan-Byoung Chae","affiliation":["School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Chan-Byoung","lastName":"Chae","id":"37275083600"},{"name":"Sang-hyun Kim","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics, University of Texas, Austin, Austin, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Sang-hyun","lastName":"Kim","id":"37577893700"},{"name":"Robert W.

In this paper, we propose a ranging method measuring the round-trip time-of-flight of an OFDM symbol. Timing measurements are vulnerable to symbol-timing synchronization error. We propose a novel approach to overcome such errors. This approach is based on the time-reversal technique in which multipath effect appears as an advantage. In frequency selective channels, where different OFDM subcarriers experience different delays, time-reversal method conveniently eliminates the effect of the channel phase response. Thus, phase rotation of the signal caused by the timing offset in the OFDM system can be determined and removed from the measurements. We derive an approximate maximum likelihood method for estimating the phase rotation. Simulation studies demonstrate that the method provides high-quality estimates even for noisy frequency selective channels.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"OFDM ranging in multipath channels using time reversal method","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 10th Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/SPAWC.2009.5161849","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 10th Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5154399/5161729/05161849.pdf","startPage":"568","endPage":"572","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPAWC.2009.5161849","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5161729","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5161849","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5161849/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"OFDM ranging in multipath channels using time reversal method","conferenceDate":"21-24 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5161849/","dateOfInsertion":"10 July 2009","publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10750459","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"OFDM ranging in multipath channels using time reversal method","confLoc":"Perugia, Italy","sourcePdf":"1569187226.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051144S","chronDate":"21-24 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5154399","isNumber":"5161729","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5154399","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5161729","articleId":"5161849","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5161850,"authors":[{"name":"Bamrung Tau Sieskul","affiliation":["Institute of Communication Technology, Leibniz University, Hannover, Hanover, Germany"],"firstName":"Bamrung Tau","lastName":"Sieskul","id":"37298582300"},{"name":"Feng Zheng","affiliation":["Institute of Communication Technology, Leibniz University, Hannover, Hanover, Germany"],"lastName":"Feng Zheng","id":"37087198632"},{"name":"Thomas Kaiser","affiliation":["Institute of Communication Technology, Leibniz University, Hannover, Hanover, Germany"],"firstName":"Thomas","lastName":"Kaiser","id":"37269768700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3695-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3696-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1948-3244"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1948-3252"}],"articleNumber":"5161850","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":172},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5161850","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Time of arrival estimation","Attenuation","Maximum likelihood estimation","Delay effects","Bandwidth","Maximum likelihood detection","Additive noise","Delay estimation","Array signal processing","Transmitters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["correlation methods","error analysis","maximum likelihood estimation","time-of-arrival estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["time-of-arrival estimation","path attenuation","maximum correlation","maximum likelihood estimation","path loss exponent","error variance"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Time of arrival estimation","Maximum likelihood estimation"]}],"abstract":"We consider a time-of-arrival (ToA) estimation in the presence of path attenuation.

Under the assumption that the CFO of each user is sufficiently small the considered approach leads to U different approximate ML (AML) joint phase offset, CFO and ST estimators. Specifically, the phase and CFO estimators are in closed form while the AML ST estimator requires a one-dimensional maximization procedure. The performance of the proposed joint AML estimator is assessed via computer simulations both in AWGN and multipath channel, and for three different allocation schemes.","doi":"10.1109/SPAWC.2009.5161858","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 10th Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 10th Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5154399/5161729/05161858.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPAWC.2009.5161858","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5161729","startPage":"613","endPage":"617","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint symbol timing and CFO estimation in multiuser OFDM/OQAM systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5161858","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Joint symbol timing and CFO estimation in multiuser OFDM/OQAM systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 June 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5161858/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"21-24 June 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10761964","dateOfInsertion":"10 July 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5161858/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint symbol timing and CFO estimation in multiuser OFDM/OQAM systems","confLoc":"Perugia, Italy","sourcePdf":"1569182720.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05673S","chronDate":"21-24 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5154399","isNumber":"5161729","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5154399","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"5161729","articleId":"5161858","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5161859,"authors":[{"name":"Luca Sanguinetti","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy"],"firstName":"Luca","lastName":"Sanguinetti","id":"37269450000"},{"name":"Michele Morelli","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy"],"firstName":"Michele","lastName":"Morelli","id":"37273534500"},{"name":"Giuseppe Imbarlina","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy"],"firstName":"Giuseppe","lastName":"Imbarlina","id":"37393019800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3695-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3696-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1948-3244"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1948-3252"}],"articleNumber":"5161859","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":84},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cognitive radio","OFDM","Discrete Fourier transforms","Iterative algorithms","Frequency estimation","Interference","Wireless LAN","Frequency division multiplexing","Grid computing","Computer simulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","frequency estimation","iterative methods","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["carrier-frequency offset estimation","orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing","cognitive radio system","iterative algorithm","computer simulation"]}],"abstract":"This work deals with the problem of carrier-frequency offset estimation in orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing-based cognitive radio systems.

A bandpass SigmaDelta ADC is used for the analog to digital conversion process. An accurate and realistic model of the clock jitter in bandpass SigmaDelta ADC is implemented. Results from this paper show that clock jitter severely degrades OFDM system performance by introducing both phase and waveform noise. It is shown that for the case of sampling at IF stage, the effect of waveform noise is quite small and negligible compared to the phase noise effect. Therefore, an estimation and compensation method based on the existing phase noise compensation method is proposed for alleviating the effect of clock jitter. Simulation results are presented, showing the significant performance gain of our proposed algorithm, providing a new and innovative way of dealing with the clock jitter problem of bandpass A/D conversion in OFDM systems.","doi":"10.1109/SPAWC.2009.5161860","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 10th Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 10th Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5154399/5161729/05161860.pdf","startPage":"623","endPage":"627","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPAWC.2009.5161860","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5161729","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Clock jitter estimation and suppression in OFDM systems employing bandpass \u03a3\u0394 ADC","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5161860","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 June 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5161860/","displayDocTitle":"Clock jitter estimation and suppression in OFDM systems employing bandpass \u03a3\u0394 ADC","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10750462","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5161860/","conferenceDate":"21-24 June 2009","dateOfInsertion":"10 July 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Clock jitter estimation and suppression in OFDM systems employing bandpass \u03a3\u0394 ADC","confLoc":"Perugia, Italy","sourcePdf":"1569185106.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.03604S","chronDate":"21-24 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5154399","isNumber":"5161729","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5154399","xplore-issue":"5161729","articleId":"5161860","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5161861,"authors":[{"name":"Sylvain Traverso","affiliation":["Thales Communications, Colombes, France"],"firstName":"Sylvain","lastName":"Traverso","id":"37581210900"},{"name":"Myriam Ariaudo","affiliation":["ETIS, ENSEA,CNRS, Universit\u00e9 de Cergy-Pontoise, Cergy-Pontoise, France"],"firstName":"Myriam","lastName":"Ariaudo","id":"37268253200"},{"name":"Inbar Fijalkow","affiliation":["ETIS, ENSEA,CNRS, Universit\u00e9 de Cergy-Pontoise, Cergy-Pontoise, France"],"firstName":"Inbar","lastName":"Fijalkow","id":"37269104600"},{"name":"Jean-Luc Gautier","affiliation":["ETIS, ENSEA,CNRS, Universit\u00e9 de Cergy-Pontoise, Cergy-Pontoise, France"],"firstName":"Jean-Luc","lastName":"Gautier","id":"37277497800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3695-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3696-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1948-3244"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1948-3252"}],"articleNumber":"5161861","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":207},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Frequency estimation","OFDM","Demodulation","Baseband","Interference","Numerical simulation","Wireless communication","WiMAX","Discrete Fourier transforms","Degradation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["numerical analysis","OFDM modulation","radio receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["IQ imbalance estimation","carrier frequency offset","OFDM receivers","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing system","numerical simulation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["IQ imbalance","Carrier Frequency Offset","Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM)"]}],"abstract":"We propose a new algorithm for the IQ imbalance estimation and equalization of an Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) system in the presence of a Carrier Frequency Offset (CFO) and of a dense multipath environment.

These techniques are based on the calculation and minimization of functions of the log-likelihood ratios (LLR) of the syndrome elements obtained according to the parity check matrix of the error correcting code. In the case of a BPSK modulation, the global minimum of the cost function is obtained using the gradient descent method while for higher order modulations, we use the simulated annealing algorithm. Simulation results show that the proposed techniques significantly outperform many phase estimation methods and are very powerful even at low signal-to-noise ratios.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 10th Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5154399/5161729/05161863.pdf","startPage":"638","endPage":"642","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 10th Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/SPAWC.2009.5161863","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPAWC.2009.5161863","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5161729","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5161863","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Effective techniques for blind phase offset estimation in LDPC coded systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Phase estimation","Parity check codes","Binary phase shift keying","Phase modulation","Cost function","Simulated annealing","Error correction codes","Signal to noise ratio","Telecommunications","Modulation coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error correction codes","minimisation","parity check codes","phase estimation","phase shift keying","simulated annealing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["LDPC code","blind phase offset estimation","carrier phase offset estimation","low-density parity-check code","binary phase shift keying modulation","BPSK modulation","minimization","log likelihood ratios","error correcting code","higher order modulations","simulated annealing"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5161863/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"Effective techniques for blind phase offset estimation in LDPC coded systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5161863/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10750465","dateOfInsertion":"10 July 2009","conferenceDate":"21-24 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Effective techniques for blind phase offset estimation in LDPC coded systems","confLoc":"Perugia, Italy","sourcePdf":"1569187216.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067418S","chronDate":"21-24 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5154399","isNumber":"5161729","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5154399","xplore-issue":"5161729","articleId":"5161863","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5161865,"authors":[{"name":"Yupeng Liu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Drexel University, Philadelphia, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Yupeng","lastName":"Liu","id":"37578003700"},{"name":"Athina.

Different users use different transmit antennas, thus, each user contributes a different carrier frequency offset (CFO) at the receiver. The multiple CFOs introduce intercarrier interference, thus impeding user separation and transmit signal recovery. A low complexity CFO estimation approach is proposed for estimating multiple CFOs. The proposed approach relies on one or more pilot symbols per user which are placed far from each other and each one carries the same symbol over a number of successive blocks. A user's CFO is obtained based on averaging over consecutive OFDM blocks of the symbols corresponding to the pilot tones of that user. Simulation results suggest that accurate CFOs estimation is possible with a very small amount of averaging, which makes the method applicable to the case of slowly varying channels. The proposed approach does not require channel state information, which is important as channel state information cannot be easily obtained before CFO correction.","doi":"10.1109/SPAWC.2009.5161865","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 10th Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 10th Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5154399/5161729/05161865.pdf","startPage":"648","endPage":"652","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPAWC.2009.5161865","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5161729","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Carrier frequency offset estimation in OFDMA systems based on averaging over successive blocks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5161865","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 June 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5161865/","displayDocTitle":"Carrier frequency offset estimation in OFDMA systems based on averaging over successive blocks","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10750466","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5161865/","conferenceDate":"21-24 June 2009","dateOfInsertion":"10 July 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Carrier frequency offset estimation in OFDMA systems based on averaging over successive blocks","confLoc":"Perugia, Italy","sourcePdf":"1569187435.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052565S","chronDate":"21-24 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5154399","isNumber":"5161729","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5154399","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5161729","articleId":"5161865","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5161866,"authors":[{"name":"Zhongwei Si","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and ACCESS Linnaeus Center, Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden"],"firstName":"Zhongwei","lastName":"Si","id":"37391714700"},{"name":"Ragnar Thobaben","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and ACCESS Linnaeus Center, Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden"],"firstName":"Ragnar","lastName":"Thobaben","id":"37285065000"},{"name":"Mikael Skoglund","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and ACCESS Linnaeus Center, Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden"],"firstName":"Mikael","lastName":"Skoglund","id":"37265042800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3695-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3696-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1948-3244"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1948-3252"}],"articleNumber":"5161866","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":75},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Concatenated codes","Relays","Iterative decoding","Chromium","Strontium","Information analysis","Robustness","Protocols","AWGN","Fading"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["concatenated codes","iterative decoding","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed serially concatenated codes concatenated codes","distributed codes","3-node relay channel","snap-shot analysis","iterative DSCC decoder","extrinsic information transfer"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On distributed serially concatenated codes","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5161866","doi":"10.1109/SPAWC.2009.5161866","startPage":"653","endPage":"657","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 10th Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 10th Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5154399/5161729/05161866.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPAWC.2009.5161866","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5161729","abstract":"In this paper, we investigate the performance of a new class of distributed codes for the 3-node relay channel, distributed serially concatenated codes (DSCCs).

Simulation results in multi-user detection of high-speed downlink packet access (HSDPA) system show that the proposed method offers considerable performance gain over conventional RAKE and MMSE algorithms.","doi":"10.1109/SPAWC.2009.5161869","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 10th Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5154399/5161729/05161869.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5161729","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPAWC.2009.5161869","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 10th Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications","startPage":"668","endPage":"671","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint modulation classification and multi-user detection using multi-modulation sphere decoding","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5161869","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"Joint modulation classification and multi-user detection using multi-modulation sphere decoding","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5161869/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5161869/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10750469","dateOfInsertion":"10 July 2009","conferenceDate":"21-24 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint modulation classification and multi-user detection using multi-modulation sphere decoding","confLoc":"Perugia, Italy","sourcePdf":"1569187150.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042304S","chronDate":"21-24 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5154399","isNumber":"5161729","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5154399","xplore-issue":"5161729","articleId":"5161869","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":5161872,"authors":[{"name":"Yichuan Hu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Delaware, Newark, DE, USA"],"firstName":"Yichuan","lastName":"Hu","id":"38272221000"},{"name":"Javier Garcia-Frias","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Delaware, Newark, DE, USA"],"firstName":"Javier","lastName":"Garcia-Frias","id":"38274987800"},{"name":"Meritxell Lamarca","affiliation":["Department of Signal Theory and Comm., Technical University of Catalonia, Barcelona, Spain","Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Delaware, Newark, DE, USA"],"firstName":"Meritxell","lastName":"Lamarca","id":"37266547500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3695-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3696-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1948-3244"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1948-3252"}],"articleNumber":"5161872","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":127},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Monte Carlo methods","Channel coding","Maximum likelihood decoding","Signal to noise ratio","Rate distortion theory","Channel capacity","AWGN channels","Additive white noise","Performance analysis","Delay"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["AWGN channels","combined source-channel coding","importance sampling","maximum likelihood decoding","mean square error methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discrete-time all-analog-processing joint source-channel coding system","Monte Carlo importance sampling","additive white Gaussian noise channel","AWGN channel encoding","space-filling curve","ML decoding","minimum mean square error","MMSE decoding","channel SNR region"]}],"abstract":"We investigate the performance of a discrete-time all-analog-processing joint source-channel coding system for the transmission of i.i.d.

Estimating them as accurately as possible using as short as possible training sequences can markedly improve error performance as well as the capacity of CDMA systems. The fresh look advocated here permeates benefits from recent advances in variable selection (VS) and compressive sampling (CS) approaches to multiuser communications by casting estimation of these parameters as a sparse linear regression problem. Novel estimators are developed by exploiting two forms of sparsity present: the first emerging from user (in) activity, and the second because the actual nonzero parameters are very few relative to the number of candidate user delays and channel taps. Simulations demonstrate an order of magnitude gains in performance when sparsity-aware estimators of CDMA parameters are compared to sparsity-agnostic standard least-squares based alternatives.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiaccess communication","Parameter estimation","Delay estimation","Timing","Dispersion","Input variables","Sampling methods","Casting","Linear regression","Performance gain"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","multi-access systems","parameter estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CDMA","active users","possibly dispersive channels","wireless code division multiple access","variable selection","compressive sampling","multiuser communications","sparse linear regression problem","sparsity-agnostic standard least-squares"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5161875","doi":"10.1109/SPAWC.2009.5161875","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 10th Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5154399/5161729/05161875.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPAWC.2009.5161875","startPage":"697","endPage":"701","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5161729","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 10th Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sparsity-aware estimation of CDMA system parameters","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Sparsity-aware estimation of CDMA system parameters","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5161875/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 June 2009","conferenceDate":"21-24 June 2009","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5161875/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"10 July 2009","publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10750470","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sparsity-aware estimation of CDMA system parameters","confLoc":"Perugia, Italy","sourcePdf":"1569184636.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.079782S","chronDate":"21-24 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5154399","isNumber":"5161729","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5154399","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"5161729","articleId":"5161875","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5161876,"authors":[{"name":"E.

Because of severe power constraints on the RF tag, a thorough knowledge of the backscatter channel is necessary to maximize backscatter-radio and radio-frequency identification (RFID) system performance. This article presents four link budgets that account for the major propagation mechanisms of the backscatter channel, along with a detailed discussion of each. Use of the link budgets is demonstrated by a practical UHF RFID portal example. The benefits of future 5.8 GHz multi-antenna backscatter-radio systems are shown. An intuitive analogy for understanding the antenna polarization of RF tag systems is presented.","doi":"10.1109/MAP.2009.5162013","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MAP.2009.5162013","startPage":"11","endPage":"25","publicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel5/74/5161998/05162013.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5161998","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Complete Link Budgets for Backscatter-Radio and RFID Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5162013/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 July 2009","displayDocTitle":"Complete Link Budgets for Backscatter-Radio and RFID Systems","volume":"51","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"14 July 2009","accessionNumber":"10764633","publicationDate":"April 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5162013/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Complete Link Budgets for Backscatter-Radio and RFID Systems","sourcePdf":"0015.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.079996S","chronDate":"April  2009","xplore-pub-id":"74","isNumber":"5161998","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"74","citationCount":"292","xplore-issue":"5161998","articleId":"5162013","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":5162029,"authors":[{"name":"Stelios A.

The method uses the property that for a linear array with uniform element spacing, an inverse Fourier transform relationship exists between the array factor and the element excitations. This property is used in an iterative way to derive the array element excitations from the prescribed array factor. A brief outline of the iterative Fourier technique for the synthesis of low-sidelobe patterns for linear arrays will be given. The effectiveness of this method for realizing low-sidelobe sum and difference patterns will be demonstrated for linear arrays equipped with 50 and 80 elements. This demonstration of effectiveness also involves the recovery of the original low-sidelobe patterns, as close as possible, in case of element failures. Included is a program listing of this synthesis method, coded in MATLABtrade. With a few minor modifications/additions, the included MATLAB program can also be used for the design of thinned linear arrays having a periodic element spacing. Since the computational part of the included MATLAB program is coded using vector/matrix operations, this program can easily be extended for the synthesis of low-sidelobe patterns of planar arrays with a periodic element spacing, including pattern recovery in the case of defective elements.","doi":"10.1109/MAP.2009.5162038","publicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel5/74/5161998/05162038.pdf","startPage":"137","endPage":"150","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MAP.2009.5162038","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5161998","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low-Sidelobe Pattern Synthesis Using Iterative Fourier Techniques Coded in MATLAB [EM Programmer's Notebook]","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5162038","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 July 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5162038/","displayDocTitle":"Low-Sidelobe Pattern Synthesis Using Iterative Fourier Techniques Coded in MATLAB [EM Programmer's Notebook]","volume":"51","issue":"2","publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10764642","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5162038/","dateOfInsertion":"14 July 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low-Sidelobe Pattern Synthesis Using Iterative Fourier Techniques Coded in MATLAB [EM Programmer's Notebook]","sourcePdf":"0040.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.058708S","chronDate":"April  2009","xplore-pub-id":"74","isNumber":"5161998","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"74","citationCount":"46","xplore-issue":"5161998","articleId":"5162038","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-19"},{"_id":5162049,"authors":[{"name":"Trevor S.

Microscopic color image edge detection has proven to be a difficult task due to uneven brightness, cross-color existing between cell boundary and background caused by dyeing and noise. To solve these problems, this paper originally employs an improved PCNN model called multi-dimensional PCNN to implement edge detection of microscopic color cell image. PCNN is an advanced approach which aims at processing color images parellelly rather than separately dispose signal to every channel because it is characterized by synchronous neuronal burst and multi-dimensional convolution. To test the feasibility and effectiveness of multi-dimensional PCNN on edge detection of microscopic color cell images, experiments of several microscopic cell images are carried out. Empirical results show that multi-dimensional PCNN outperforms classical methods in terms of anti-noise and the accuracy of weak edge detection.","doi":"10.1109/ICBBE.2009.5162192","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 3rd International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/5162127/5162128/05162192.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 3rd International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedical Engineering","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICBBE.2009.5162192","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5162128","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A New Approach for Edge Detection of Color Microscopic Image Using Modified Pulse Coupled Neural Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image edge detection","Microscopy","Neural networks","Colored noise","Color","Brightness","Background noise","Signal processing","Convolution","Testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomedical imaging","cellular biophysics","edge detection","medical image processing","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["edge detection","color microscopic image","modified pulse coupled neural networks","microscopic color cell image edge detection","novel algorithm","cell boundary","multidimensional PCNN","multidimensional convolution","weak edge detection"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5162192/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"A New Approach for Edge Detection of Color Microscopic Image Using Modified Pulse Coupled Neural Networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5162192/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","dateOfInsertion":"14 July 2009","conferenceDate":"11-13 June 2009","accessionNumber":"10777140","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A New Approach for Edge Detection of Color Microscopic Image Using Modified Pulse Coupled Neural Networks","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"03-01-020.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062857S","chronDate":"11-13 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5162127","isNumber":"5162128","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5162127","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5162128","articleId":"5162192","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5162201,"authors":[{"name":"Chunhe Song","affiliation":["Institute of Information and Technology, Northeastern University, Shenyang, China"],"firstName":"Chunhe","lastName":"Song","id":"37406218600"},{"name":"Hai Zhao","affiliation":["Institute of Information and Technology, Northeastern University, Shenyang, China"],"firstName":"Hai","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37276548500"},{"name":"Wei Jing","affiliation":["Institute of Information and Technology, Northeastern University, Shenyang, China"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Jing","id":"38252284900"},{"name":"Guilan Luo","affiliation":["Institute of Information and Technology, Northeastern University, Shenyang, China"],"firstName":"Guilan","lastName":"Luo","id":"37574050000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2902-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2901-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2151-7614"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2151-7622"}],"articleNumber":"5162201","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":77},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Particle swarm optimization","Filtering algorithms","Signal processing algorithms","Computational modeling","Distributed computing","Particle filters","Particle measurements","Sampling methods","Optimization methods","Signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biology computing","filtering theory","particle swarm optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["particle swarm optimization","unscented particle filtering","filtering algorithm","nonlinear dynamic systems","bird social behavior simulation"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5162201","abstract":"A new filtering algorithm - PSO-UPF was proposed for nonlinear dynamic systems. Basing on the concept of re-sampling, particles with bigger weights should be re-sampled more time, and in the PSO-UPF, after calculating the weight of particles, some particles will join in the refining process, which means that these particles will move to the region with higher weights. This process can be regarded as one-step predefined PSO process, so the proposed algorithm is named PSO-UPF. Although the PSO process increases the computing load of PSO-UPF, but the refined weights may make the proposed distribution more closed to the poster distribution.

When economy and population was consider as influence factors, the sustainable development status of water resources in China is different from the distribution of resources endowment. Besides less per-capita water resources, the low water utilization efficiency in the regions with abundant water is another element restricting water resources sustainable use.

Conventional fractal dimension (FD) is utilized to describe boundary complexity with weaker criminative power. The objective of the paper is to explore new boundary irregularity descriptors at different scales. In the paper, there are two novel measures of boundary's structural irregularities and multiscale features related to boundary roughness are proposed using an integrated quantitative model combining Gaussian filtering and local FDs. There are two key elements in the scheme: (1) Local fractal distributions are taken as a tool to describe local irregularity along boundaries at different scales with meaningful diagnosis features; (2) multi-scaled boundaries generated by Gaussian filters could produce boundary's outlines important to measure of structural irregularity. The advantage of the approach is that feature clusters of boundary irregularity are formed at different scales, so that extracted measurements from multi-scales could provide effective descriptors compared to the conventional FD and other boundary based methods. Experiments show that the proposed irregular descriptors not only enhance finer expressions of boundary complexity but also could effectively discriminate melanomas among moles using statistical features of boundary roughness at different scales.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Description of Boundary Irregularity On Multi-Scale Local FD for Melanomas","publicationTitle":"2009 3rd International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedical Engineering","doi":"10.1109/ICBBE.2009.5162582","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 3rd International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/5162127/5162128/05162582.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICBBE.2009.5162582","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5162128","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5162582","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5162582/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"Description of Boundary Irregularity On Multi-Scale Local FD for Melanomas","conferenceDate":"11-13 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5162582/","dateOfInsertion":"14 July 2009","publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10777527","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Description of Boundary Irregularity On Multi-Scale Local FD for Melanomas","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"03-01-135.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055134S","chronDate":"11-13 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5162127","isNumber":"5162128","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5162127","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5162128","articleId":"5162582","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5162644,"authors":[{"name":"Jie Wang","affiliation":["Guanganmen Hospital, Chinese Academy of Traditional Chinese Medical, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jie","lastName":"Wang","id":"37089060067"},{"name":"Yanwei Xing","affiliation":["Guanganmen Hospital, Chinese Academy of Traditional Chinese Medical, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yanwei","lastName":"Xing","id":"37573563500"},{"name":"Janxin Chen","affiliation":["Beijing university of Chinese medicine, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Janxin","lastName":"Chen","id":"37406658900"},{"name":"Yonghong Gao","affiliation":["Beijing university of Chinese medicine, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yonghong","lastName":"Gao","id":"37577853100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2902-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2901-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2151-7614"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2151-7622"}],"articleNumber":"5162644","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":128},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5162644","abstract":"Integration of western medicine and Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) to cure Coronary Heart Disease (CHD) is taken by more and more Chinese.

We carry out a clinical epidemiology survey of Coronary Heart Disease and obtain 1069 cases. Each case is certainly a CHD case based on the evidence from Coronary Artery Angiography. It includes 78 symptoms and is diagnosed by TCM mentors as syndrome or syndrome combinations. We proposed an unsupervised cluster algorithm to partition 78 symptoms into several clusters. Each cluster is diagnosed by TCM mentor as syndrome and is clinically verified. The obtained seven clusters correspond to seven syndromes in TCM and the clinical verification consolidates the result. Each cluster is used as selected attributes to performe classification and the resulting accuracy is higher than 90%, which indicates that the cluster is successful and the data surveyed is of high quality. The investigation of the cluster algorithm to CHD data to retrieve syndromes in CHD successfully bridges gap between western medicine and TCM.","doi":"10.1109/ICBBE.2009.5162644","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 3rd International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/5162127/5162128/05162644.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 3rd International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedical Engineering","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICBBE.2009.5162644","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5162128","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Discovering Syndromes in Coronary Heart Disease by Cluster Algorithm Based on Random Neural Network","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cardiac disease","Clustering algorithms","Neural networks","Medical diagnostic imaging","Humans","Bridges","Costs","Medical treatment","Recurrent neural networks","Neurons"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["angiocardiography","blood vessels","cardiovascular system","diseases","image classification","medical image processing","neural nets","pattern clustering","unsupervised learning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["syndrome discovery","coronary heart disease","random neural network","traditional Chinese medicine","medical theory system","clinical epidemiology","coronary artery angiography","unsupervised cluster algorithm","syndrome classification","western medicine"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5162644/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"Discovering Syndromes in Coronary Heart Disease by Cluster Algorithm Based on Random Neural Network","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5162644/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","dateOfInsertion":"14 July 2009","conferenceDate":"11-13 June 2009","accessionNumber":"10777589","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Discovering Syndromes in Coronary Heart Disease by Cluster Algorithm Based on Random Neural Network","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"01-01-078.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.112463S","chronDate":"11-13 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5162127","isNumber":"5162128","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5162127","xplore-issue":"5162128","articleId":"5162644","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":5162679,"authors":[{"name":"Min Tang","affiliation":["College of Electrical Engineering, Nantong University, Nantong, China"],"firstName":"Min","lastName":"Tang","id":"37085720507"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2902-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2901-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2151-7614"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2151-7622"}],"articleNumber":"5162679","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":4,"totalDownloads":397},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5162679","abstract":"On the basis of brief description of cellular neural network, the process of edge detection based on CNN is introduced with the flow chart of whole algorithm designed, and several kernel techniques are explained respectively in details.

The simulation experiment result indicated that this method can enhance the accuracy of prediction of protein structure.","doi":"10.1109/ICBBE.2009.5162936","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","publicationTitle":"2009 3rd International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedical Engineering","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICBBE.2009.5162936","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5162128","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 3rd International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/5162127/5162128/05162936.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improved Prediction Method of Protein Contact Based on RBF Neural Network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5162936/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Improved Prediction Method of Protein Contact Based on RBF Neural Network","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5162936/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10777880","publicationDate":"June 2009","dateOfInsertion":"14 July 2009","conferenceDate":"11-13 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 June 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improved Prediction Method of Protein Contact Based on RBF Neural Network","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"01-04-035.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040387S","chronDate":"11-13 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5162127","isNumber":"5162128","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5162127","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5162128","articleId":"5162936","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":5163011,"authors":[{"name":"Hao Yin","affiliation":["Sichuan University, Chengdu, Sichuan, CN"],"firstName":"Hao","lastName":"Yin","id":"37290463000"},{"name":"Dong Liu","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, Sichuan University, China"],"firstName":"Dong","lastName":"Liu","id":"37308603600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2902-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2901-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2151-7614"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2151-7622"}],"articleNumber":"5163011","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":215},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image resolution","Ultrasonic imaging","Neural networks","Spatial resolution","Speckle","Ultrasonic transducers","Apertures","Artificial neural networks","Medical diagnosis","Biomedical transducers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomedical ultrasonics","filtering theory","fuzzy neural nets","image enhancement","image fusion","image resolution","image sampling","learning (artificial intelligence)","medical image processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["lateral resolution enhancement","ultrasound image","neural network","ultrasound imaging technique","medical diagnosis","speckle artifact","active transducer aperture","transmit focal depth","generalization parameter","fuzzy logic","data fusion","image sample data","training network"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5163011","abstract":"Ultrasound imaging techniques are widely applied for medical diagnosis. However its main disadvantage compared with other techniques are low resolution and speckle artifacts. Therefore, improving the spatial resolution of ultrasound images has been a very active research area. System parameters that affect resolution include the size of the active transducer aperture, the center frequency and the bandwidth of the transducer, and the selected transmit focal depth. This paper presents an approach to enhance the lateral resolution by reproducing the underlying mapping between a low resolution image and a high resolution image obtained with different aperture size. Artificial neural networks are used to build the mapping. A generalization parameter is added to neural network and fuzzy logic is used to perform the resulting data fusion. In addition, a local histogram algorithm is used to filter the speckle like sample data when training network.","doi":"10.1109/ICBBE.2009.5163011","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","publicationTitle":"2009 3rd International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedical Engineering","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICBBE.2009.5163011","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5162128","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 3rd International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/5162127/5162128/05163011.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Lateral Resolution Enhancement of Ultrasound Image Using Neural Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5163011/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Lateral Resolution Enhancement of Ultrasound Image Using Neural Networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5163011/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10777955","publicationDate":"June 2009","dateOfInsertion":"14 July 2009","conferenceDate":"11-13 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 June 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Lateral Resolution Enhancement of Ultrasound Image Using Neural Networks","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"03-01-004.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042803S","chronDate":"11-13 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5162127","isNumber":"5162128","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5162127","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5162128","articleId":"5163011","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5163040,"authors":[{"name":"Qidong Zhang","affiliation":["School of Information Science & Engineering, Shenyang Ligong University, Shenyang, China"],"firstName":"Qidong","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37576007500"},{"name":"Liqun Gao","affiliation":["School of Information Science & Engineering, Northeastern University, Shenyang, China"],"firstName":"Liqun","lastName":"Gao","id":"37274359700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2902-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2901-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2151-7614"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2151-7622"}],"articleNumber":"5163040","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":88},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5163040","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Biomedical imaging","Image retrieval","Fractals","Information retrieval","Geometry","Feature extraction","Humans","Support vector machines","Feedback","Image databases"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computerised tomography","feature extraction","image retrieval","image texture","medical image processing","relevance feedback","support vector machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["medical image retrieval algorithm","nonsubsampled contourlet transform","image texture","fractal feature extraction","SVM relevance feedback","CT image database","user intention"]}],"abstract":"A novel medical image retrieval algorithm based on texture information is proposed. The texture image retrieval based on fractal geometry is a commonly used method. However, it is inadequate only using fractal dimension to describe the texture. The nonsubsampled contourlet transform has the properties of multi-scale and multi-direction. Firstly, the nonsubsampled contourlet transform were done on original texture image, and then the fractal dimension of the transformed image was computed. The algorithm extracts fractal features with scale and orientation characteristics. To decrease the gap between high level concepts in human minds and low level features computed by computers, an improved SVM relevance feedback is introduced according to users' intention. A database of CT images was retrieved by this algorithm. The result shows it can achieve a high precision of retrieval.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5162128","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICBBE.2009.5163040","publicationTitle":"2009 3rd International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedical Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 3rd International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/5162127/5162128/05163040.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doi":"10.1109/ICBBE.2009.5163040","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Medical Image Retrieval Based On Nonsubsampled Contourlet Transform and Fractal Dimension","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"Medical Image Retrieval Based On Nonsubsampled Contourlet Transform and Fractal Dimension","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"11-13 June 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5163040/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10777984","dateOfInsertion":"14 July 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5163040/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Medical Image Retrieval Based On Nonsubsampled Contourlet Transform and Fractal Dimension","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"03-01-070.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044884S","chronDate":"11-13 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5162127","isNumber":"5162128","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5162127","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5162128","articleId":"5163040","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5163167,"authors":[{"name":"Dong Liang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, Milwaukee, WI, USA"],"firstName":"Dong","lastName":"Liang","id":"37573010300"},{"name":"Leslie Ying","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, Milwaukee, WI, USA"],"firstName":"Leslie","lastName":"Ying","id":"37287708500"},{"name":"Feng Liang","affiliation":["Department of Industrial Engineering, Nankai University, Tianjin, China"],"firstName":"Feng","lastName":"Liang","id":"37574419000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2902-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2901-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2151-7614"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2151-7622"}],"articleNumber":"5163167","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":182},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Magnetic resonance imaging","Acceleration","Image reconstruction","Distributed control","Compressed sensing","Reconstruction algorithms","Coils","Equations","Computer science","Industrial engineering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomedical MRI","image coding","image reconstruction","medical image processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["parallel MRI acceleration","magnetic resonance imaging","M-FOCUSS algorithm","distributed compressed sensing","sensitivity encoding","DCS reconstruction"]}],"abstract":"Parallel magnetic resonance imaging (pMRI) cannot achieve its maximum reduction factor due to practical limitations.

Numerical results are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of Hermite-Rodriguez functions and the usefulness of the design method to solve the waveform set design problem.","doi":"10.1109/ICSAP.2009.30","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Signal Acquisition and Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Signal Acquisition and Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5163804/5163805/05163818.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSAP.2009.30","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5163805","startPage":"26","endPage":"29","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Waveform Set Design Using Hermite-Rodriguez Functions for CDMA Communications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5163818","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Waveform Set Design Using Hermite-Rodriguez Functions for CDMA Communications","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 April 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5163818/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"3-5 April 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10763556","dateOfInsertion":"14 July 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5163818/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Waveform Set Design Using Hermite-Rodriguez Functions for CDMA Communications","confLoc":"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"3594a026.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047153S","chronDate":"3-5 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5163804","isNumber":"5163805","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5163804","xplore-issue":"5163805","articleId":"5163818","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5163848,"authors":[{"name":"Dileep Kumar","affiliation":["Department of Information Technology, Indian Institute of Information Technology, Allahabad, India"],"firstName":"Dileep","lastName":"Kumar","id":"37574618800"},{"name":"Shirshu Varma","affiliation":["Department of Information Technology, Indian Institute of Information Technology, Allahabad, India"],"firstName":"Shirshu","lastName":"Varma","id":"37390998000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3594-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5163848","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":214},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Target recognition","Layout","Satellites","Image resolution","Image recognition","Image edge detection","Area measurement","Image segmentation","Feature extraction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feature extraction","neural nets","object detection","radar imaging","target tracking"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiresolution framework","neural network","automatic target recognition","high resolution satellite image","Zernike moments","feature extraction"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Automatic Target Recognition","Wavelet Transform"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5163848","abstract":"Automatic Target Recognition (ATR) is an approach by which we identify one or a group of target-objects in a scene. It plays a pivotal role in the challenging fields of defense and civil. Most of the methods in this context are based on fix window-size technique. In this paper we propose a novel approach which gives scale, rotation and translation invariant results for automatic target recognition in high-resolution satellite images which in turn are able to recognize the multiple targets in a scene. We have developed a system which can predict the possible area of interest in a scene, where target may be present or not. Prediction of areas of interest is based on edge detection and similarity measure of wavelet co-occurrence features of segmented sub-blocks. Zernike moments, calculated for scale and translation normalized area of interest, is thereby used as the features of the concerned area. Zernike moments are rotation invariant. The extracted features are then fed to trained neural network for recognition. This approach is more suitable for the satellite images because resolution of image and idea about the target are two essential factors by which we can predict the minimum and maximum size of the target. The approach takes considerably less time compared to the fix window based approach because the predicted numbers of interest areas to be processed in a scene are very less. The proposed approach has successfully been tested on number of satellite images of different resolutions and their timing analysis has been compared with fix window based approach.","doi":"10.1109/ICSAP.2009.58","startPage":"168","endPage":"173","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Signal Acquisition and Processing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSAP.2009.58","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5163805","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Signal Acquisition and Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5163804/5163805/05163848.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiresolution Framwork with Neural Network Approach for Automatic Target Recognition (ATR)","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5163848/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Multiresolution Framwork with Neural Network Approach for Automatic Target Recognition (ATR)","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5163848/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10763573","publicationDate":"April 2009","dateOfInsertion":"14 July 2009","conferenceDate":"3-5 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 April 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiresolution Framwork with Neural Network Approach for Automatic Target Recognition (ATR)","confLoc":"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"3594a168.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053585S","chronDate":"3-5 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5163804","isNumber":"5163805","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5163804","xplore-issue":"5163805","articleId":"5163848","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5163883,"authors":[{"name":"Ivan Olaf Hernandez Fuentes","affiliation":["Facultad de Ingenier\u00eda, Universidad Aut\u00f3noma de Baja California, Mexicali, M\u00e9xico"],"firstName":"Ivan Olaf Hernandez","lastName":"Fuentes","id":"37087711365"},{"name":"Miguel Enrique Bravo-Zanoguera","affiliation":["Universidad Autonoma de Baja California, Mexicali, Baja California, MX"],"firstName":"Miguel Enrique","lastName":"Bravo-Zanoguera","id":"38276755000"},{"name":"Guillermo Galaviz Yanez","affiliation":["Facultad de Ingenier\u00eda, Universidad Aut\u00f3noma de Baja California, Mexicali, M\u00e9xico"],"firstName":"Guillermo Galaviz","lastName":"Yanez","id":"38272158400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-3587-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5163883","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1071},"abstract":"Current image sensors offer a raw output that incorporates a bayer color filter pattern, and additional processing is required to obtain a full color image.

The whole system is composed of the controller system and the drive circuits, one driver circuit for each motor on the robotic arm. These drive circuits are needed because the control system does not supply enough power to drive the motors directly. The controller system is implemented on the Spartan-II FPGA chip using VHDL code. Spartan-II FPGA is capable of running at much higher speed but a slow clock is needed to obtain relatively large delays for the output signals. This paper basically focus on the work of our project which is based on motion control using stepper motor. We have successfully done the basic part of project in which we control the stepper motor using FPGA. We have successfully done the programming and simulation part of the project. We enjoyed the PCB designing, soldering and troubleshooting of PCB. This project gives the idea regarding controlling servo and stepper motor using interfacing of ULN2803A with FPGA. Consequently, it's important to understand how to work, and what problems exist in designing effective robots. This project will address one of those problems: positional control.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MSPCT.2009.5164161","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5164158","startPage":"8","endPage":"11","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Multimedia, Signal Processing and Communication Technologies","pdfPath":"/iel5/5154400/5164158/05164161.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robot arm controller using FPGA","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5164161/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 March 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5164161/","displayDocTitle":"Robot arm controller using FPGA","conferenceDate":"14-16 March 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2009","accessionNumber":"10763266","dateOfInsertion":"14 July 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robot arm controller using FPGA","confLoc":"Aligarh, India","sourcePdf":"123.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076907S","chronDate":"14-16 March 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5154400","isNumber":"5164158","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5154400","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5164158","articleId":"5164161","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5164162,"authors":[{"name":"Vibha Aggarwal","affiliation":["COE, Punjabi University Neighborhood Campus, Rampura Phul, Punjab"],"firstName":"Vibha","lastName":"Aggarwal","id":"37585379200"},{"name":"Manjeet Singh Patterh","affiliation":["ECE, UCOE, Punjabi University, Patiala, Punjab"],"firstName":"Manjeet Singh","lastName":"Patterh","id":"37398464900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3602-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3604-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5164162","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":322},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Discrete cosine transforms","Electrocardiography","Laplace equations","Discrete wavelet transforms","Karhunen-Loeve transforms","Signal processing algorithms","Chromium","Fourier transforms","Discrete transforms","Measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data compression","discrete cosine transforms","electrocardiography","Huffman codes","Laplace transforms","medical signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ECG compression","discrete cosine transform","Laplacian pyramid","electrocardiogram signal","root mean square difference","Max-Lloyd quantizer","arithmetic coding","Huffman coding"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["ECG Compression","Discrete Cosine transform (DCT)","Laplacian Pyramid","PRD","quality controlled"]}],"abstract":"This paper introduces a new quality controlled Discrete Cosine transform (DCT) and Laplacian Pyramid based compression method for electrocardiogram (ECG) signal.

Generally, the block matching techniques are used for motion compensation and the matching criterions used are mean absolute difference (MAD) and mean square error (MSE). MSE has more computation than MAD and therefore, MAD is the most preferred block matching criterion for its low computation and simplicity. It has been found that MAD does not satisfies the low bit rate requirement for coding purposes as it considers the average value of the residue frame. In this paper, an efficient block matching criterion for motion compensation is being proposed and compared with MAD and MSE.

A stereo vision system can measure distance to an obstacle using disparity. However, this system has several problems such as sampling error, geometric problems due to the installation of a stereo camera, and image distortion in the calibration and rectification processes that cause deterioration in accuracy and reliability. We utilize a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) method to correct mean error, and also a strong tracking interacting multiple model (ST-IMM) Kalman filter is proposed to minimize the error variance. The ST-IMM has robustness for maneuver and non-stationary error variance. ST-IMM has an advantage that one model can complement another model's shortcomings by using several sub-models. A simple data association method based on nearest neighborhood filtering is proposed to track multiple obstacles. The experiment results show that our algorithms can estimate the target's position and track multiple objects within about 4% distance error in range of 10 to 50 m, even when the target vehicle maneuvers rapidly.","doi":"10.1109/IVS.2009.5164255","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/5136863/5164242/05164255.pdf","startPage":"72","endPage":"77","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IVS.2009.5164255","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5164242","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Position estimation and multiple obstacles tracking method based on stereo vision system","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5164255","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 June 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5164255/","displayDocTitle":"Position estimation and multiple obstacles tracking method based on stereo vision system","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10763019","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5164255/","conferenceDate":"3-5 June 2009","dateOfInsertion":"14 July 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Position estimation and multiple obstacles tracking method based on stereo vision system","confLoc":"Xi'an, China","sourcePdf":"0013.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.088061S","chronDate":"3-5 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5136863","isNumber":"5164242","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5136863","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5164242","articleId":"5164255","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5164274,"authors":[{"name":"H.

Dark scene detail is carried by illuminated objects such as pedestrians; color information is carried by colored lights. The intra-scene contrast between dark scene detail and bright colored lights can often be extreme making wide dynamic range (WDR) image capture necessary. Dedicated night vision systems extend the spectral range from the visible (VIS) into the near infrared (NIR) range, but render only a grayscale image, and are not generally WDR-capable. Although multi-spectral VIS-NIR systems can simultaneously capture and fuse color and NIR information, they are often large and costly. A low-cost solution has been developed based on a WDR CMOS imager with widely used color filter array (CFA) technology. In contrast to common practice, no IR cut-filter is used, and the G2-filter of the standard Bayer pattern is removed to create a pixel with VIS+IR sensitivity. This paper concentrates on how to use such an imager in an automotive true color night vision system by removing the IR signal from the color channels then fusing VIS+IR grayscale information with color information.","doi":"10.1109/IVS.2009.5164290","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/5136863/5164242/05164290.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IVS.2009.5164290","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5164242","startPage":"273","endPage":"278","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A low-cost VIS-NIR true color night vision video system based on a wide dynamic range CMOS imager","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5164290","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A low-cost VIS-NIR true color night vision video system based on a wide dynamic range CMOS imager","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 June 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5164290/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"3-5 June 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10763102","dateOfInsertion":"14 July 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5164290/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A low-cost VIS-NIR true color night vision video system based on a wide dynamic range CMOS imager","confLoc":"Xi'an, China","sourcePdf":"0048.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07808S","chronDate":"3-5 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5136863","isNumber":"5164242","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5136863","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"5164242","articleId":"5164290","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5164295,"authors":[{"name":"Thomas Gumpp","affiliation":["FZI Forschungszentrum Informatik Intelligent Systems and Production Engineering, Karlsruhe, Germany"],"firstName":"Thomas","lastName":"Gumpp","id":"37295586100"},{"name":"Dennis Nienhuser","affiliation":["FZI Forschungszentrum Informatik Intelligent Systems and Production Engineering, Karlsruhe, Germany"],"firstName":"Dennis","lastName":"Nienhuser","id":"38557840300"},{"name":"Rebecca Liebig","affiliation":["FZI Forschungszentrum Informatik Intelligent Systems and Production Engineering, Karlsruhe, Germany"],"firstName":"Rebecca","lastName":"Liebig","id":"38557288800"},{"name":"J.

Emerging technologies like brake-by-wire or steer-by-wire pave the way for collision avoidance and threat identification systems. Obviously, decision making in such critical situations requires high reliability of the information base. Especially for comfort systems, we need to take into account that the user tends to trust the information provided by the ADAS. In this paper, we present a robust system architecture for the reliable recognition of circular traffic signs. Our system employs complementing approaches for the different stages of current TSR systems. This introduces the application of local SIFT features for content-based traffic sign detection along with widely applied shape-based approaches. We further add a technique called contracting curve density (CCD) to refine the localization of the detected traffic sign candidates and therefore increase the performance of the subsequent classification module. Finally, the recognition stage based on SIFT and SURF descriptions of the candidates executed by a neural net provides a robust classification of structured image content like traffic signs. By applying these steps we compensate the weaknesses of the utilized approaches, and thus, improve the system's performance.","doi":"10.1109/IVS.2009.5164298","pdfPath":"/iel5/5136863/5164242/05164298.pdf","startPage":"324","endPage":"329","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IVS.2009.5164298","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5164242","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Towards reliable traffic sign recognition","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5164298/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"Towards reliable traffic sign recognition","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"14 July 2009","accessionNumber":"10776828","publicationDate":"June 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5164298/","conferenceDate":"3-5 June 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Towards reliable traffic sign recognition","confLoc":"Xi'an, China","sourcePdf":"0056.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053363S","chronDate":"3-5 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5136863","isNumber":"5164242","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5136863","citationCount":"48","xplore-issue":"5164242","articleId":"5164298","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":5164304,"authors":[{"name":"Raoul de Charette","affiliation":["Centre de Robotic CAOR, Ecole des Mines de Paris, Paris, France"],"firstName":"Raoul","lastName":"de Charette","id":"37571727200"},{"name":"Fawzi Nashashibi","affiliation":["Centre de Robotic CAOR,INRIA, Ecole des Mines de Paris (ENSMP), Le Chesnay, France"],"firstName":"Fawzi","lastName":"Nashashibi","id":"38492117500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3503-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3504-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1931-0587"}],"articleNumber":"5164304","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":104,"citationCountPatent":4,"totalDownloads":3273},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Real time systems","Cameras","Testing","Layout","Detection algorithms","Motion detection","Lighting","Shape","Feeds","Prototypes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer vision","feature extraction","image matching","image motion analysis","object detection","object recognition","road vehicles","traffic engineering computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["real time visual traffic light recognition","spot light detection","adaptive traffic light templates","on-vehicle camera application","urban scene","motion blur","illumination variation","shape analysis","adaptive template matcher"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5164304","abstract":"This paper introduces a new real-time traffic light recognition system for on-vehicle camera applications.

This detector was run on an independent highway dataset, storing true detections and false positives to obtain a selectively sampled training set for the active learning training iteration. Various configurations of the newly trained classifier were tested, experimenting with the trade-off between detection rate and false detection rate. Experimental results show that this method yields a vehicle classifier with a high detection rate and low false detection rate on real data, yielding a valuable addition to environmental awareness for intelligent active safety systems in vehicles.","doi":"10.1109/IVS.2009.5164311","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/5136863/5164242/05164311.pdf","startPage":"399","endPage":"404","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IVS.2009.5164311","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5164242","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Active learning based robust monocular vehicle detection for on-road safety systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5164311/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"Active learning based robust monocular vehicle detection for on-road safety systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10763112","htmlLink":"/document/5164311/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"14 July 2009","conferenceDate":"3-5 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Active learning based robust monocular vehicle detection for on-road safety systems","confLoc":"Xi'an, China","sourcePdf":"0069.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075243S","chronDate":"3-5 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5136863","isNumber":"5164242","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5136863","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"5164242","articleId":"5164311","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5164325,"authors":[{"name":"Wangqiang Niu","affiliation":["Marine Technology & Control Engineering Key Laboratory, Shanghai Maritime University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Wangqiang","lastName":"Niu","id":"37314335700"},{"name":"Jianxin Chu","affiliation":["Marine Technology & Control Engineering Key Laboratory, Shanghai Maritime University, Shanghai, China"],"lastName":"Jianxin Chu","id":"37087374301"},{"name":"Wei Gu","affiliation":["Marine Technology & Control Engineering Key Laboratory, Shanghai Maritime University, Shanghai, China"],"lastName":"Wei Gu","id":"37087373898"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3503-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3504-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1931-0587"}],"articleNumber":"5164325","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":57},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5164325","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Statistics","Energy consumption","Portals","Cranes","Robustness","Shape","Filters","Fluctuations","Marine technology","Control engineering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["estimation theory","maintenance engineering","statistical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["maintenance cycle estimation","local fault interval model","multipoint statistics method","sigmoidals method"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["maintenance cycle","local fault interval","multi-point statistics method","difference of Sigmoidals","inverted bathtub shape"]}],"abstract":"Maintenance cycle is an important factor of a repairable system, and it is closely related to the safety operation and the level of energy consumption of the system.

However, most of these systems are designed to perform in good weather conditions and they perform very poorly in adverse weather particularly in rain. A big problem related to rainy weather conditions that highly limits the performance of DAS is raindrops on car windshields. We present a novel approach that detects raindrops on a car windshield using only a single image from an in-vehicle camera and a standard interest point detector for pre-selection of raindrop candidates. The algorithm models the geometric shape of a raindrop on the car windshield, utilizes its photometric properties and establishes a relationship between raindrop and environment. The proposed algorithm outperforms existing machine vision-based approaches for the task of raindrop modeling and detection from an in-vehicle perspective. It functions very accurately and is robust in terms of imprecise positions of raindrop candidates. Its results can be further used for image restoration and vision enhancement and hence it is a valuable tool for DAS.","doi":"10.1109/IVS.2009.5164347","startPage":"610","endPage":"615","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/5136863/5164242/05164347.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IVS.2009.5164347","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5164242","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Raindrop detection on car windshields using geometric-photometric environment construction and intensity-based correlation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Automotive components","Automotive engineering","Construction industry","Rain","Cameras","Detectors","Solid modeling","Shape","Photometry","Robustness"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational geometry","computer vision","driver information systems","image restoration"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["raindrop detection","car windshields","geometric-photometric environment construction","intensity-based correlation","vision-based driver assistance system","automotive industry","adverse weather condition","rainy weather condition","in-vehicle camera","photometric property","machine vision enhancement","raindrop modeling","image restoration"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5164347/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"Raindrop detection on car windshields using geometric-photometric environment construction and intensity-based correlation","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5164347/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","dateOfInsertion":"14 July 2009","conferenceDate":"3-5 June 2009","accessionNumber":"10763168","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Raindrop detection on car windshields using geometric-photometric environment construction and intensity-based correlation","confLoc":"Xi'an, China","sourcePdf":"0105.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057431S","chronDate":"3-5 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5136863","isNumber":"5164242","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5136863","citationCount":"40","xplore-issue":"5164242","articleId":"5164347","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5164354,"authors":[{"name":"Christoph Hermes","affiliation":["Faculty of Technology, Bielefeld University, Bielefeld, Germany"],"firstName":"Christoph","lastName":"Hermes","id":"37541101000"},{"name":"Christian Wohler","affiliation":["Daimler AG Group Research, Environment Perception, Ulm, Germany"],"firstName":"Christian","lastName":"Wohler","id":"38630320800"},{"name":"Konrad Schenk","affiliation":["Daimler AG Group Research, Environment Perception, Ulm, Germany"],"firstName":"Konrad","lastName":"Schenk","id":"37085930640"},{"name":"Franz Kummert","affiliation":["Faculty of Technology, Bielefeld University, Bielefeld, Germany"],"firstName":"Franz","lastName":"Kummert","id":"37329495800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3503-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3504-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1931-0587"}],"articleNumber":"5164354","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":91,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":2087},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Particle filters","Roads","Motion detection","Vehicle detection","Trajectory","Rotation measurement","Particle tracking","Motion estimation","Acceleration","Turning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["driver information systems","image classification","image motion analysis","particle filtering (numerical methods)","prediction theory","probability","radial basis function networks","road traffic","road vehicles"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["long-term vehicle motion prediction","driver assistance system","road traffic","road crossing scenario","hazardous situation","vehicle position","ego-vehicle","trajectory classification","particle filter","quaternion-based rotationally invariant longest common subsequence metric","QRLCS metric","radial basis function","RBF classifier","a-priori probability","mean-shift technique","likelihood value","curve radius"]}],"abstract":"Future driver assistance systems will have to cope with complex traffic situations, especially in the road crossing scenario. To detect potentially hazardous situations as early as possible, it is therefore desirable to know the position and motion of the ego-vehicle and vehicles around it for several seconds in advance. For this purpose, we propose in this study a long-term prediction approach based on a combined trajectory classification and particle filter framework. As a measure for the similarity between trajectories, we introduce the quaternion-based rotationally invariant longest common subsequence (QRLCS) metric. The trajectories are classified by a radial basis function (RBF) classifier with an architecture that is able to process trajectories of arbitrary non-uniform length. The particle filter framework simultaneously tracks and assesses a large number of motion hypotheses (~10\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n), where the class-specific probabilities estimated by the RBF classifier are used as a-priori probabilities for the hypotheses of the particle filter. The hypotheses are clustered with a mean-shift technique and are assigned a likelihood value. Motion prediction is performed based on the cluster centre with the highest likelihood. While traditional motion prediction based on curve radius and acceleration is inaccurate especially during turning manoeuvres, we show that our approach achieves a reasonable motion prediction even for long prediction intervals of 3 s for these complex motion patterns.","doi":"10.1109/IVS.2009.5164354","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/5136863/5164242/05164354.pdf","startPage":"652","endPage":"657","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IVS.2009.5164354","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5164242","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Long-term vehicle motion prediction","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5164354","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 June 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5164354/","displayDocTitle":"Long-term vehicle motion prediction","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10776854","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5164354/","conferenceDate":"3-5 June 2009","dateOfInsertion":"14 July 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Long-term vehicle motion prediction","confLoc":"Xi'an, China","sourcePdf":"0112.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058536S","chronDate":"3-5 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5136863","isNumber":"5164242","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5136863","citationCount":"91","xplore-issue":"5164242","articleId":"5164354","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":5164357,"authors":[{"name":"Tobias Gindele","affiliation":["Institute for Anthropomatics, University of Karlsruhe, Karlsruhe, Germany"],"firstName":"Tobias","lastName":"Gindele","id":"37542786000"},{"name":"Sebastian Brechtel","affiliation":["Institute for Anthropomatics, University of Karlsruhe, Karlsruhe, Germany"],"firstName":"Sebastian","lastName":"Brechtel","id":"37542789400"},{"name":"Joachim Schroder","affiliation":["Institute for Anthropomatics, University of Karlsruhe, Karlsruhe, Germany"],"firstName":"Joachim","lastName":"Schroder","id":"37302331100"},{"name":"Rudiger Dillmann","affiliation":["Institute for Anthropomatics, University of Karlsruhe, Karlsruhe, Germany"],"firstName":"Rudiger","lastName":"Dillmann","id":"37280242100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3503-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3504-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1931-0587"}],"articleNumber":"5164357","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":61,"citationCountPatent":8,"totalDownloads":1819},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5164357","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bayesian methods","Filters","Filtering","Mobile robots","Robot sensing systems","Measurement uncertainty","Simultaneous localization and mapping","Target tracking","Layout","Predictive models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["belief networks","mobile robots","path planning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Bayesian occupancy grid filter","dynamic environments","prior map knowledge","mobile robotics","motion planning"]}],"abstract":"Building a model of the environment is essential for mobile robotics.

The basic idea of occupancy filters is to represent the environment as a 2-dimensional grid of cells holding information about their state of occupancy and velocity. To improve the accuracy of predictions, prior knowledge about the motion preferences is used, derived from map data that can be obtained from navigation systems.

Based on the traffic flow model and in conjunction with nonlinear feedback theory, an on-ramp PID controller regulated by BP neural network is designed. According to real-time traffic status, BP neural network is used to adjust the PID parameters dynamically in order to minimize the performance index defined in terms of the density tracking errors.

We applied an imaging optics to receive information over long distance, and two cameras are used to solve the relationship between the transmitter and the receiver position changes with time, and vibrational correction technique is also fixed to the system to minimize vibrational affections. We developed algorithms to track the transmitter.

It is possible to use an electronic differential (ED) instead of the heavy mechanical differential because of the fast response time of the motor. A new ED control approach for a two-in-wheel-motor drive EV is devised based on the fuzzy logic control method. The fuzzy logic method employs to estimate the slip rate of each wheel considering the complex and nonlinear of the system. Then, the ED system distributes torque and power to each motor according to requirements. The effectiveness and validation of the proposed control method are evaluated in the Matlab/Simulink environment.

The neural network training and validation data are obtained from the open-loop simulation of a validated first principles plant model. The identified neural network (NN) model is validated using the following three different validation algorithms: (1) one-step ahead cross-correlation; (2) Akaike's final prediction error (AFPE) estimate; and (3) 5-step ahead prediction simulations. The algorithm has been applied to the temperature control of a fluidized bed furnace reactor of the steam deactivation unit of a fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) pilot plant used to evaluate catalyst performance. The validation results show that the RNN models the reactor to a high degree of accuracy.

Finally, the simulation results demonstrate the modeling capabilities of the proposed method.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 June 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5164573/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10763319","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5164573/","publicationDate":"June 2009","dateOfInsertion":"14 July 2009","conferenceDate":"24-26 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"On training radial basis function neural networks using optimal fuzzy clustering","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On training radial basis function neural networks using optimal fuzzy clustering","confLoc":"Thessaloniki, Greece","sourcePdf":"070_0284.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.13951S","chronDate":"24-26 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5155894","isNumber":"5164494","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5155894","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5164494","articleId":"5164573","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":5164575,"authors":[{"name":"Vassilios Petridis","affiliation":["Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Greece"],"firstName":"Vassilios","lastName":"Petridis","id":"37284181100"},{"name":"Briti Deb","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Reading, UK"],"firstName":"Briti","lastName":"Deb","id":"37580148200"},{"name":"Vassilis Syrris","affiliation":["Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Greece"],"firstName":"Vassilis","lastName":"Syrris","id":"37070629900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4684-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4685-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5164575","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":219},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Humans","Neural networks","Biological system modeling","Joints","Kinematics","Image resolution","Shape measurement","Computer networks","Classification algorithms","Testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feature extraction","image classification","image motion analysis","image representation","learning (artificial intelligence)","neural nets","time series"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["human action detection","human action identification","predictive modular neural networks","2D kinematic model","human actions classification","human motion","anthropometric proportion","anatomical shape representation","articulated human body contour","anatomical knowledge","silhouette extraction","2D human stick figure","feature extraction","2D model","training phase","training video","time series classification algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["human detection","human action recognition","PREMONN classification algorithm","2D human body modeling","anthropometrics Introduction (Heading 1)"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5164575","abstract":"The aim of the present study is to validate a 2D kinematic model of human body in providing considerable features that they could be used for human actions classification. Human motion can be termed as a non-rigid, articulated motion, with body parts being piecewise rigid, held together by joints. The presented approach uses the fact that the human body has certain anthropometric proportion and uses the anatomical shape representation of the non-rigid and articulated human body contour. The body joints and the different body parts are detected with help of prior anatomical knowledge and extracted silhouette. The result of this kinematics based approach is a simple 2D human stick figure. Features are extracted from this 2D model and used to represent the human body. In the training phase, each training video is represented by a neural network, while in classification phase, the predictive modular neural network (PREMONN) time series classification algorithm is applied to classify the human actions.","doi":"10.1109/MED.2009.5164575","pdfPath":"/iel5/5155894/5164494/05164575.pdf","startPage":"406","endPage":"411","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 17th Mediterranean Conference on Control and Automation","publicationTitle":"2009 17th Mediterranean Conference on Control and Automation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MED.2009.5164575","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5164494","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Detection and identification of human actions using Predictive Modular Neural Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5164575/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"Detection and identification of human actions using Predictive Modular Neural Networks","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"14 July 2009","accessionNumber":"10776958","publicationDate":"June 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5164575/","conferenceDate":"24-26 June 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Detection and identification of human actions using Predictive Modular Neural Networks","confLoc":"Thessaloniki, Greece","sourcePdf":"072_0193.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.085578S","chronDate":"24-26 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5155894","isNumber":"5164494","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5155894","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5164494","articleId":"5164575","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":5164598,"authors":[{"name":"Balaje T.

However, their role in civilian applications is hampered by the lack of adequate guidelines and operational requirements. In this paper a set of flight, operational and performance requirements for the use of fixed wing UAVs in civilian applications are collated from several resources in the public domain. The application of these requirements to the flight control of an unmanned fixed-wing aircraft is also addressed in this paper. A robust controller is designed to maintain the stability and the desired performance of the system in the presence of modeling uncertainty and measurement noise. A neural network based Fault Detection and Identification (FDI) scheme is then developed to estimate the effectiveness of control inputs. Finally, a reconfigurable controller is designed to compensate for the degradation of the actuation on the occurrence of a fault. Monte Carlo simulation is used to validate the capability and performance of the designed controller.","doi":"10.1109/MED.2009.5164625","startPage":"700","endPage":"705","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 17th Mediterranean Conference on Control and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel5/5155894/5164494/05164625.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 17th Mediterranean Conference on Control and Automation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MED.2009.5164625","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5164494","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Unmanned Aerial Vehicles operational requirements and fault-tolerant robust control in level flight","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Unmanned aerial vehicles","Fault tolerance","Robust control","Aerospace control","Robust stability","Fault detection","Guidelines","Aircraft","Noise robustness","Measurement uncertainty"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["aerospace control","aircraft","fault tolerance","Monte Carlo methods","remotely operated vehicles","robust control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["unmanned aerial vehicles","fault-tolerant robust control","level flight","flight control","fixed-wing aircraft","fault detection","fault identification","neural network","reconfigurable controller","Monte Carlo simulation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Unmanned Aerial Vehicles","UAV Requirements of Operations","Fault Tolerant Control"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5164625/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"Unmanned Aerial Vehicles operational requirements and fault-tolerant robust control in level flight","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5164625/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","dateOfInsertion":"14 July 2009","conferenceDate":"24-26 June 2009","accessionNumber":"10776981","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Unmanned Aerial Vehicles operational requirements and fault-tolerant robust control in level flight","confLoc":"Thessaloniki, Greece","sourcePdf":"125_0354.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042806S","chronDate":"24-26 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5155894","isNumber":"5164494","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5155894","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5164494","articleId":"5164625","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":5164641,"authors":[{"name":"George C.

A miniature rotorcraft, with four control inputs and six degrees of freedom, has an inherently multivariable behavior that exhibits coupling effects among the different axes of motion. The dynamics of this type of aerial vehicle is characterized by instability, high-order and sensitivity to disturbance. For rotorcraft to function as a stable mobile platform in changing flight conditions, therefore, its dynamics must be understood and modeled as the basis for controlling such a vehicle. The paper presents a development of linear model of a small scale helicopter using multi input multi output time domain identification system. The results from first principle approach are used as initial condition in the prediction error minimization scheme to achieve convergence. It is demonstrated that the proposed technique can enhance the accuracy of dynamics model obtained from the first principle prediction. Using the technique, the establishment of global helicopter linear model can be achieved for a practical design of linear control laws.","doi":"10.1109/MED.2009.5164659","publicationTitle":"2009 17th Mediterranean Conference on Control and Automation","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 17th Mediterranean Conference on Control and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel5/5155894/5164494/05164659.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MED.2009.5164659","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5164494","startPage":"898","endPage":"903","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Integrated identification modeling of rotorcraft-based unmanned aerial vehicle","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5164659","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Integrated identification modeling of rotorcraft-based unmanned aerial vehicle","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 June 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5164659/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"24-26 June 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10763424","dateOfInsertion":"14 July 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5164659/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Integrated identification modeling of rotorcraft-based unmanned aerial vehicle","confLoc":"Thessaloniki, Greece","sourcePdf":"159_0182.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045077S","chronDate":"24-26 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5155894","isNumber":"5164494","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5155894","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"5164494","articleId":"5164659","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5164661,"authors":[{"name":"Andrea Cesetti","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Ingegneria Informatica Gestionale e dellAutomazione, Universit\u00e0 Politecnica delle Marche, Ancona, Italy"],"firstName":"Andrea","lastName":"Cesetti","id":"37547465000"},{"name":"Emanuele Frontoni","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Ingegneria Informatica Gestionale e dellAutomazione, Universit\u00e0 Politecnica delle Marche, Ancona, Italy"],"firstName":"Emanuele","lastName":"Frontoni","id":"37300940500"},{"name":"Adriano Mancini","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Ingegneria Informatica Gestionale e dellAutomazione, Universit\u00e0 Politecnica delle Marche, Ancona, Italy"],"firstName":"Adriano","lastName":"Mancini","id":"38182762500"},{"name":"Primo Zingaretti","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Ingegneria Informatica Gestionale e dellAutomazione, Universit\u00e0 Politecnica delle Marche, Ancona, Italy"],"firstName":"Primo","lastName":"Zingaretti","id":"37300938600"},{"name":"Sauro Longhi","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Ingegneria Informatica Gestionale e dellAutomazione, Universit\u00e0 Politecnica delle Marche, Ancona, Italy"],"firstName":"Sauro","lastName":"Longhi","id":"37287256600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4684-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4685-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5164661","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":18,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":802},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Unmanned aerial vehicles","Aircraft navigation","Satellite navigation systems","Helicopters","Machine vision","Algorithm design and analysis","Image resolution","Trajectory","Global Positioning System","Shape"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["helicopters","image matching","image recognition","mobile robots","object detection","path planning","remotely operated vehicles","robot vision","target tracking"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["vision-based autonomous navigation","unmanned aerial vehicle","natural landmarks","autonomous helicopter","high resolution aerial image","satellite image","GPS","feature-based image matching algorithm","autonomous landing","target detection","target recognition","target tracking"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents the design and implementation of a vision-based navigation and landing algorithm for an autonomous helicopter. The vision system allows to define target areas from a high resolution aerial or satellite image to determine the waypoints of the navigation trajectory or the landing area. The helicopter is required to navigate from an initial position to a final position in a partially known environment using GPS and vision, to locate a landing target (a helipad of a known shape or a natural landmark) and to land on it. The vision system, using a feature-based image matching algorithm, finds the area and gives feedbacks to the control system for autonomous landing. Vision is used for accurate target detection, recognition and tracking. The helicopter updates its landing target parameters owing to vision and uses an on board behavior-based controller to follow a path to the landing site. Results show the appropriateness of the vision-based approach that does not require any artificial landmark (e.g., helipad) and is quite robust to occlusions, light variations and seasonal changes (e.g., brown or green leaves).","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Vision-based autonomous navigation and landing of an unmanned aerial vehicle using natural landmarks","publicationTitle":"2009 17th Mediterranean Conference on Control and Automation","doi":"10.1109/MED.2009.5164661","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 17th Mediterranean Conference on Control and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel5/5155894/5164494/05164661.pdf","startPage":"910","endPage":"915","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MED.2009.5164661","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5164494","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5164661","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5164661/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"Vision-based autonomous navigation and landing of an unmanned aerial vehicle using natural landmarks","conferenceDate":"24-26 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5164661/","dateOfInsertion":"14 July 2009","publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10763426","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Vision-based autonomous navigation and landing of an unmanned aerial vehicle using natural landmarks","confLoc":"Thessaloniki, Greece","sourcePdf":"161_0356.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049731S","chronDate":"24-26 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5155894","isNumber":"5164494","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5155894","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"5164494","articleId":"5164661","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5164690,"authors":[{"name":"H.

It focuses on improving the search space boundaries and allowing GAs to discover new search spaces which are not accessible initially. A GA using this approach is developed and validated to the optimization of power system stabilizer parameters within a multimachine system (16-generator and 68-bus). The obtained results are evaluated and compared with those of ordinary GAs and literature. They show significant improvement in terms of optimization performance and convergence rate.","doi":"10.1109/MED.2009.5164690","startPage":"1084","endPage":"1089","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 17th Mediterranean Conference on Control and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel5/5155894/5164494/05164690.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 17th Mediterranean Conference on Control and Automation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MED.2009.5164690","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5164494","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Genetic algorithms based dynamic search spaces for global power system stabilizer optimization","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power system dynamics","Genetic algorithms","Power systems","Power system stability","Power system interconnection","Damping","Power system transients","Power system modeling","Optimization methods","Automatic control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","power system dynamic stability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithm","dynamic search space","power system stabilizer optimization","objective function evolution","multimachine system","convergence rate"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5164690/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"Genetic algorithms based dynamic search spaces for global power system stabilizer optimization","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5164690/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","dateOfInsertion":"14 July 2009","conferenceDate":"24-26 June 2009","accessionNumber":"10777013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Genetic algorithms based dynamic search spaces for global power system stabilizer optimization","confLoc":"Thessaloniki, Greece","sourcePdf":"190_0141.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060513S","chronDate":"24-26 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5155894","isNumber":"5164494","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5155894","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5164494","articleId":"5164690","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5164705,"authors":[{"name":"Christoforos Economakos","affiliation":["Department of Automation, Halkis Institute of Technology, Greece"],"firstName":"Christoforos","lastName":"Economakos","id":"37298924100"},{"name":"George Economakos","affiliation":["School of ECE, National and Technical University of Athens, Athens, Greece"],"firstName":"George","lastName":"Economakos","id":"37373878200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4684-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4685-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5164705","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":186},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Programmable control","Industrial control","Electrical equipment industry","Automation","Automatic control","Application software","Hardware","Control system synthesis","Software tools"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","high level synthesis","industrial control","program compilers","programmable controllers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FPGA implementation","PLC program compiler technique","industrial control","factory automation","programmable logic controller","electronic system level modeling methodology","high-level hardware synthesis","custom translating software","microarchitectural level design","coding template"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["PLC","STL code","FPGA","TLM","hardware synthesis","ESL"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents an automated framework for obtaining high-performance FPGA implementations of industrial automation and control algorithms coded as PLC programs. The proposed method is mainly targeting demanding applications, requiring lots of numerical computations. Based on previous experience, the proposed framework exploits electronic system level modeling methodologies and tools for high-level hardware synthesis. Since most of these tools are not compatible with PLC development environments, custom translating software built by using standard compiler techniques, can be employed for converting PLC programs to a form that can be understood by the selected tools. Furthermore, the translating software uses different coding templates to support microarchitectural level design trade-offs. Experimental results involving three well-known industrial control algorithms show that appropriate coding styles can offer 2x performance improvements, being simple and syntactically similar to Statement List code.","doi":"10.1109/MED.2009.5164705","publicationTitle":"2009 17th Mediterranean Conference on Control and Automation","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 17th Mediterranean Conference on Control and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel5/5155894/5164494/05164705.pdf","startPage":"1172","endPage":"1177","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MED.2009.5164705","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5164494","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5164705","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An architectural exploration framework for efficient FPGA implementation of PLC programs","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 June 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5164705/","displayDocTitle":"An architectural exploration framework for efficient FPGA implementation of PLC programs","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5164705/","publicationDate":"June 2009","dateOfInsertion":"14 July 2009","conferenceDate":"24-26 June 2009","accessionNumber":"10763449","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An architectural exploration framework for efficient FPGA implementation of PLC programs","confLoc":"Thessaloniki, Greece","sourcePdf":"207_0302.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052621S","chronDate":"24-26 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5155894","isNumber":"5164494","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5155894","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5164494","articleId":"5164705","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5164717,"authors":[{"name":"Diomidis Katzourakis","affiliation":["Intelligent Systems & Robotics Laboratory, Technical University of Crete, Chania, Greece","Biomechanical Engineering, Technical University Delft, Netherlands"],"firstName":"Diomidis","lastName":"Katzourakis","id":"37545965600"},{"name":"Nikos I.

In the presence of partially unknown dynamics, the optimal regulation control problem is addressed while the optimal tracking control problem is addressed in the presence of known dynamics. Each design entails two portions: an action neural network (NN) that is designed to produce a nearly optimal control signal, and a critic NN which evaluates the performance of the system. Novel weight update laws for the critic and action NN's are derived, and all parameters are tuned online. Lyapunov techniques are used to show that all signals are uniformly ultimately bounded (UUB) and that the output of the action NN approaches the optimal control input with small bounded error. Simulation results are also presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 17th Mediterranean Conference on Control and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel5/5155894/5164494/05164741.pdf","startPage":"1390","endPage":"1395","publicationTitle":"2009 17th Mediterranean Conference on Control and Automation","doi":"10.1109/MED.2009.5164741","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MED.2009.5164741","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5164494","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5164741","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal control of affine nonlinear discrete-time systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optimal control","Neural networks","Control systems","Nonlinear equations","Cost function","Dynamic programming","Nonlinear control systems","Nonlinear dynamical systems","Riccati equations","Jacobian matrices"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discrete time systems","dynamic programming","Jacobian matrices","neurocontrollers","nonlinear control systems","optimal control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["affine nonlinear discrete-time systems","direct neural dynamic programming techniques","Hamilton Jacobi-Bellman","action neural network","optimal tracking control problem","uniformly ultimately bounded","Lyapunov techniques"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["online nolinear optimal control","Hamilton Jacobi-Bellman","neural networks","adaptive critic"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5164741/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"Optimal control of affine nonlinear discrete-time systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5164741/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10777038","dateOfInsertion":"14 July 2009","conferenceDate":"24-26 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal control of affine nonlinear discrete-time systems","confLoc":"Thessaloniki, Greece","sourcePdf":"246_0154.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061296S","chronDate":"24-26 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5155894","isNumber":"5164494","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5155894","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"5164494","articleId":"5164741","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5164743,"authors":[{"name":"Draguna Vrabie","affiliation":["Automation and Robotics Research Institute, University of Texas, Arlington, Arlington, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Draguna","lastName":"Vrabie","id":"37563201000"},{"name":"Kyriakos Vamvoudakis","affiliation":["Automation and Robotics Research Institute, University of Texas, Arlington, Arlington, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Kyriakos","lastName":"Vamvoudakis","id":"37400050500"},{"name":"Frank Lewis","affiliation":["Automation and Robotics Research Institute, University of Texas, Arlington, Arlington, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Frank","lastName":"Lewis","id":"37284885700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4684-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4685-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5164743","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":33,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":709},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Programmable control","Adaptive control","Optimal control","Adaptive algorithm","Neural networks","Performance evaluation","Convergence","State feedback","Nonlinear control systems","Nonlinear systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive control","continuous time systems","neurocontrollers","nonlinear control systems","optimal control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive optimal controller","generalized policy iteration","continuous-time framework","time-invariant system","neural network","adaptive actor algorithm","adaptive critic algorithm","nonlinear system"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["adaptive optimal control","Generalized Policy Iteration","adaptive critics","neural networks","continuous-time"]}],"abstract":"In this paper we present two adaptive algorithms which offer solution to the continuous-time optimal control problem for nonlinear, affine in the inputs, time-invariant systems. Both algorithms were developed based on the generalized policy iteration technique and involve adaptation of two neural network structures namely actor, providing the control signal, and critic, performing evaluation of the control performance. Despite the similarities, the two adaptive algorithms differ in the manner in which the adaptation takes place, required knowledge on the system dynamics, and formulation of the persistence of excitation requirement. The main difference is that one algorithm uses sequential adaptation of the actor and critic structures, i.e. while one is trained the other one is kept constant, while for the second algorithm the two neural networks are trained synchronously in a continuous-time fashion. The two algorithms are described in detail and proof of convergence is provided. Simulation results of applying the two algorithms for finding the optimal state feedback controller of a nonlinear system are also presented.","doi":"10.1109/MED.2009.5164743","publicationTitle":"2009 17th Mediterranean Conference on Control and Automation","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 17th Mediterranean Conference on Control and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel5/5155894/5164494/05164743.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MED.2009.5164743","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5164494","startPage":"1402","endPage":"1409","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive optimal controllers based on Generalized Policy Iteration in a continuous-time framework","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5164743","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive optimal controllers based on Generalized Policy Iteration in a continuous-time framework","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 June 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5164743/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"24-26 June 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10763468","dateOfInsertion":"14 July 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5164743/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive optimal controllers based on Generalized Policy Iteration in a continuous-time framework","confLoc":"Thessaloniki, Greece","sourcePdf":"248_0373.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.108625S","chronDate":"24-26 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5155894","isNumber":"5164494","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5155894","citationCount":"33","xplore-issue":"5164494","articleId":"5164743","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5164744,"authors":[{"name":"Gianluca Di Muro","affiliation":["Mechanical Engineering, Duke University, Durham, NC, USA"],"firstName":"Gianluca","lastName":"Di Muro","id":"37571784100"},{"name":"Silvia Ferrari","affiliation":["Mechanical Engineering, Duke University, Durham, NC, USA"],"firstName":"Silvia","lastName":"Ferrari","id":"37333128700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4684-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4685-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5164744","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":60},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5164744","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Optimal control","Dynamic programming","Aerodynamics","Automatic control","Cost function","Stability","Constraint optimization","Mechanical engineering","Automation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive control","closed loop systems","dynamic programming","neurocontrollers","optimal control","stability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["constrained penalty function method","exploratory adaptive-critic neural network control","constrained approximate dynamic programming","closed-loop system performance","stability objectives","generalized constrained approach"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Approximate dynamic programming (ADP)","constrained optimization","neural networks (NNs)","forgetting","penalty function"]}],"doi":"10.1109/MED.2009.5164744","pdfPath":"/iel5/5155894/5164494/05164744.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 17th Mediterranean Conference on Control and Automation","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 17th Mediterranean Conference on Control and Automation","startPage":"1410","endPage":"1414","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5164494","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MED.2009.5164744","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A penalty function method for exploratory adaptive-critic neural network control","abstract":"A constrained penalty function method for exploratory adaptive-critic neural network (NN) control is presented. While constrained approximate dynamic programming has been effective to guarantee closed-loop system performance and stability objectives, in the presence of a change in the plant dynamics it may not have the necessary plasticity to explore and fully adapt to the new behaviors of the plant, if these violate the constraints. A generalized constrained approach is introduced to overcome these limitations. Through this methodology it is shown that NNs are not only capable to acquire new plasticity when necessary, but also can adjust their parametric structure reducing their hidden nodes and becoming more computationally efficient.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 June 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5164744/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10777039","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5164744/","publicationDate":"June 2009","dateOfInsertion":"14 July 2009","conferenceDate":"24-26 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A penalty function method for exploratory adaptive-critic neural network control","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A penalty function method for exploratory adaptive-critic neural network control","confLoc":"Thessaloniki, Greece","sourcePdf":"249_0252.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048226S","chronDate":"24-26 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5155894","isNumber":"5164494","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5155894","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5164494","articleId":"5164744","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5164776,"authors":[{"name":"Ramin Vatankhah","affiliation":["CNR-INFM LAMIA, Dipartimento di Informatica, Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Ramin","lastName":"Vatankhah","id":"37571953900"},{"name":"Shahram Etemadi","affiliation":["CNR-INFM LAMIA, Dipartimento di Informatica, Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Shahram","lastName":"Etemadi","id":"37089137480"},{"name":"Mohammad Honarvar","affiliation":["CNR-INFM LAMIA, Dipartimento di Informatica, Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Mohammad","lastName":"Honarvar","id":"37089145821"},{"name":"Aria Alasty","affiliation":["CNR-INFM LAMIA, Dipartimento di Informatica, Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Aria","lastName":"Alasty","id":"37265639500"},{"name":"Mehrdad Boroushaki","affiliation":["CNR-INFM LAMIA, Dipartimento di Informatica, Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Mehrdad","lastName":"Boroushaki","id":"37568820100"},{"name":"Gholamreza Vossoughi","affiliation":["CNR-INFM LAMIA, Dipartimento di Informatica, Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Gholamreza","lastName":"Vossoughi","id":"37265857100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3480-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3481-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5164776","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":449},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optimization methods","Particle swarm optimization","Robot kinematics","H infinity control","Equations","Motion analysis","Birds","Marine animals","Educational institutions","Robustness"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["evolutionary computation","multi-robot systems","particle swarm optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["online velocity optimization","robotic swarm flocking","particle swarm optimization method","interactive mutual forces","agent influence","birds flocking","fish schooling","robust optimization methods","evolutionary algorithm","complicated dynamic optimization problems"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5164776","abstract":"In this paper, the agent velocity in robotic swarm was determined by using particle swarm optimization (PSO) to maximize the robotic swarm coordination velocity. A swarm as supposed here is homogenous and includes at least two members. Motion and behavior of swarm members are mostly result of two different phenomena: interactive mutual forces and influence of the agent. Interactive mutual forces comprise both attraction and repulsion. To be more realistic the field of the swarm members' view is not infinity. So influence of the coordinator agent on the robotic swarm would be local. The objective here is to guide the robotic swarm with maximum possible velocity. According to equation motion of the system, this maximum value cannot be analytically obtained. PSO is a novel method in optimization which inspired from observations of birds flocking and fish schooling. As compared to other robust optimization methods, PSO is more efficient, and requires fewer number of function evaluations, while leading to better or the same quality of results. The results show the high ability of this evolutionary algorithm in solving complicated dynamic optimization problems.","doi":"10.1109/ISMA.2009.5164776","pdfPath":"/iel5/5153269/5164773/05164776.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 6th International Symposium on Mechatronics and its Applications","publicationTitle":"2009 6th International Symposium on Mechatronics and its Applications","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISMA.2009.5164776","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5164773","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Online velocity optimization of robotic swarm flocking using particle swarm optimization (PSO) method","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5164776/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 March 2009","displayDocTitle":"Online velocity optimization of robotic swarm flocking using particle swarm optimization (PSO) method","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"14 July 2009","accessionNumber":"10776888","publicationDate":"March 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5164776/","conferenceDate":"23-26 March 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Online velocity optimization of robotic swarm flocking using particle swarm optimization (PSO) method","confLoc":"Sharjah, United Arab Emirates","sourcePdf":"56-14717-final.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.081316S","chronDate":"23-26 March 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5153269","isNumber":"5164773","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5153269","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5164773","articleId":"5164776","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":5164777,"authors":[{"name":"Afsaneh Alavi Naini","affiliation":["Science and Research Brand, Tehran Azad University, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Afsaneh Alavi","lastName":"Naini","id":"37568799300"},{"name":"Fatemeh Seiti","affiliation":["Intelligent System Laboratory, Department of electrical engineering, K.N.

We consider the problem of face and non-face classification from frontal facial images using feature selection and neural networks. We argue that feature selection is an important issue in face and non-face classification. Automatic feature subset selection distinguishes the proposed method from previous face classification approaches. First, principal component analysis (PCA) is used to represent each image as a feature vector (i.e., eigen-features) in a low-dimensional space, spanned by the eigenvectors of the covariance matrix of the training images (i.e., coefficients of the linear expansion).Then we consider linear discrimination analysis (LDA) to achieve a comparison result between these two methods of dimension reduction. Genetic algorithm (GA) is then used to select a subset of features from the low-dimensional representation by removing certain eigenvectors that do not seem to encode important information about face. Finally, a probabilistic neural network (PNN) is trained to perform face classification using the selected eigen-feature subset. Experimental results demonstrate a significant improvement in error rate reduction.","doi":"10.1109/ISMA.2009.5164777","pdfPath":"/iel5/5153269/5164773/05164777.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 6th International Symposium on Mechatronics and its Applications","publicationTitle":"2009 6th International Symposium on Mechatronics and its Applications","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISMA.2009.5164777","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5164773","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Face detection based on dimension reduction using probabilistic neural network and Genetic Algorithm","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5164777/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 March 2009","displayDocTitle":"Face detection based on dimension reduction using probabilistic neural network and Genetic Algorithm","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"14 July 2009","accessionNumber":"10763225","publicationDate":"March 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5164777/","conferenceDate":"23-26 March 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Face detection based on dimension reduction using probabilistic neural network and Genetic Algorithm","confLoc":"Sharjah, United Arab Emirates","sourcePdf":"56-14868-final.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046089S","chronDate":"23-26 March 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5153269","isNumber":"5164773","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5153269","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5164773","articleId":"5164777","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":5164797,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

The GMDH-based solution exhibits comparable identification accuracy in both the forward and inverse models as compared to state-of-the-art more computationally extensive solutions.","doi":"10.1109/ISMA.2009.5164806","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISMA.2009.5164806","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 6th International Symposium on Mechatronics and its Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5153269/5164773/05164806.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 6th International Symposium on Mechatronics and its Applications","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5164773","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"System identification of Magneto-Rheological damper using Group Method of Data Handling (GMDH)","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 March 2009","displayDocTitle":"System identification of Magneto-Rheological damper using Group Method of Data Handling (GMDH)","conferenceDate":"23-26 March 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2009","dateOfInsertion":"14 July 2009","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5164806/","accessionNumber":"10763240","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5164806/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"System identification of Magneto-Rheological damper using Group Method of Data Handling (GMDH)","confLoc":"Sharjah, United Arab Emirates","sourcePdf":"56-43862-final.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041942S","chronDate":"23-26 March 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5153269","isNumber":"5164773","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5153269","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5164773","articleId":"5164806","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5164812,"authors":[{"name":"Reem Salim","affiliation":["Electrical & Computer Engineering Department PO.Box, University of Sharjah, Sharjah, UAE"],"firstName":"Reem","lastName":"Salim","id":"37408476100"},{"name":"Maamar Bettayeb","affiliation":["Electrical & Computer Engineering Department PO.Box, University of Sharjah, Sharjah, UAE"],"firstName":"Maamar","lastName":"Bettayeb","id":"37264959700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3480-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3481-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5164812","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":127},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Reduced order systems","Power system modeling","Systems engineering and theory","Power transmission lines","Chemical reactors","Mathematical model","Computational modeling","Process control","Telecommunication control","Frequency response"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frequency response","genetic algorithms","particle swarm optimisation","reduced order systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["H2 optimal model reduction","genetic algorithms","particle swarm optimization","telecommunication systems","transmission lines","chemical reactors","mathematical modeling","high order dynamic systems","optimal model reduction techniques","frequency response","genetic algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Model Reduction","Optimal Approximation","H2 Norm","Genetic Algorithm","Particle Swarm Optimization","Global Solution"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5164812","abstract":"Modern engineering systems such as telecommunication systems, transmission lines, and chemical reactors are complex in nature. Their detailed mathematical modeling leads to high order dynamic systems.

However, most of the available optimal model reduction techniques follow computationally demanding, time consuming, iterative procedures that usually result in non-robustly stable models with poor frequency response resemblance to the original high order model in some frequency ranges.

This study suggests an approach of RBF network training through simultaneous optimization of architectures and weights with PSO-based multi-objective algorithm.

Reasons for such problems are often performance problems which occur directly on the servers (e.g. poor performance of server-side applications or during flash crowds), problems concerning the network infrastructure (e.g. long geographical distances, network overloads, etc.) and a surprising fact is that many people tend to access the same piece of information repeatedly.

The SMRNN uses separate internal states to store symbol-level context, as well as segment-level context. The symbol-level context is updated for each symbol presented for input. The segment-level context is updated after each segment. The SMRNN is trained using an extended real-time recurrent learning algorithm. We test the performance of SMRNN on the information latching problem, the ldquotwo-sequence problemrdquo and the problem of protein secondary structure (PSS) prediction. Our implementation results indicate that SMRNN performs better on long-term dependency problems than conventional RNNs.

By introducing the variation probability of the time delay, a common delayed discrete-time RNN system is transformed into one with stochastic parameters. Improved conditions for the mean square stability of these systems are obtained by employing new Lyapunov functions and novel techniques are used to achieve delay dependence. The merit of the proposed conditions lies in its reduced conservatism, which is made possible by considering not only the range of the time delays, but also the variation probability distribution. A numerical example is provided to show the advantages of the proposed conditions.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5164894/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 July 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10805296","pubMedId":"19605322","volume":"20","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/5164894/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"04 August 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Stability Analysis of Discrete-Time Recurrent Neural Networks With Stochastic Delay","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Stability Analysis of Discrete-Time Recurrent Neural Networks With Stochastic Delay","sourcePdf":"tnn-hgao-2023379.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.116926S","chronDate":"Aug.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"72","isNumber":"5191259","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"5191259","articleId":"5164894","onlineDate":"14 July 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5164905,"authors":[{"name":"Alessandro Nordio","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Politecnico di Torino, Torino, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/5312990/5164905/5164905-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Alessandro Nordio (S'00\u2013M'03) was born in Susa, Italy, in 1974.

We aim to maximize the minimum of the received signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratios (SINRs) of the SUs, subject to the constraints of the total SU transmit power and the received interference power at the primary users (PUs) by optimizing the beamforming vectors at the SU transmitter based on imperfect channel state information (CSI). To model the uncertainty in CSI, we consider a bounded region for both cases of channel matrices and channel covariance matrices. As such, the optimization is done while satisfying the interference constraints for all possible CSI error realizations. We shall first derive equivalent conditions for the interference constraints and then convert the problems into the form of semi-definite programming (SDP) with the aid of rank relaxation, which leads to iterative algorithms for obtaining the robust optimal beamforming solution. Results demonstrate the achieved robustness and the performance gain over conventional approaches and that the proposed algorithms can obtain the exact robust optimal solution with high probability.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2009.2027462","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/5312990/05164911.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2009.2027462","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5312990","startPage":"4871","endPage":"4881","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust Cognitive Beamforming With Bounded Channel Uncertainties","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5164911","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Robust Cognitive Beamforming With Bounded Channel Uncertainties","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5164911/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 July 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"57","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"10977248","dateOfInsertion":"17 November 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5164911/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust Cognitive Beamforming With Bounded Channel Uncertainties","sourcePdf":"tsp-zheng-2027462.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.103915S","chronDate":"Dec.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"5312990","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"207","xplore-issue":"5312990","articleId":"5164911","onlineDate":"14 July 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5164913,"authors":[{"name":"Ding Yu Heh","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, Singapore"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8/5230340/5164913/5164913-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ding Yu Heh (S'08) received the B.Eng. degree (first class honors) from Multimedia University, Cyberjaya, Malaysia, in 2006, and the M.Sc. degree from Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, in 2007, where he is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree.","His research areas are focused mainly on computational electromagnetics, RF and microwave circuit design."]},"firstName":"Ding Yu","lastName":"Heh","id":"37579567300"},{"name":"Eng Leong Tan","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, Singapore"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8/5230340/5164913/5164913-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Eng Leong Tan (SM'00) received the B.Eng. degree (with first class honors) from the University of Malaya, Malaysia, and the Ph.D. degree from Nanyang Technological University, Singapore.","From 1991 to 1992, he was a Research Assistant at the University of Malaya.

In this paper, thorough discussions of corrected impulse invariance method in the realm of Z-transform theory for dispersive media are presented. The correction is shown to be necessary for dispersive media which exhibit discontinuity at \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">t</i>\n = 0 in the time domain susceptibility function.

With the aid of the table, various formulations of frequency-dependent FDTD update equations using both corrected and classical impulse invariance methods are carried out conveniently. Detailed performance measures such as numerical permittivity, leading error term, dispersion relation, normalized phase and attenuation errors as well as memory storage requirements are included along with some extensive numerical comparisons.","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2009.2027150","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8/5230340/05164913.pdf","startPage":"2683","endPage":"2690","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2009.2027150","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5230340","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Corrected Impulse Invariance Method in Z-Transform Theory for Frequency-Dependent FDTD Methods","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5164913","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 July 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5164913/","displayDocTitle":"Corrected Impulse Invariance Method in Z-Transform Theory for Frequency-Dependent FDTD Methods","volume":"57","issue":"9","publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10847322","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5164913/","dateOfInsertion":"01 September 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Corrected Impulse Invariance Method in Z-Transform Theory for Frequency-Dependent FDTD Methods","sourcePdf":"tap-heh-2027150.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.065815S","chronDate":"Sept.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"5230340","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5230340","articleId":"5164913","onlineDate":"14 July 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5164927,"authors":[{"name":"Giorgio Grisetti","affiliation":["Laboratory of Autonomous Intelligent Systems, Department of Computer Science, University of Freiburg, Freiburg im Breisgau, Germany"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6979/5230362/5164927/5164927-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Giorgio Grisetti received the Ph.D. degree from the University of Rome \u201cLa Sapienza,\u201d Rome, Italy, in 2006.","He is currently a Postdoctoral Researcher with the Laboratory for Autonomous Intelligent Systems, Department of Computer Science, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.

In the past, numerous efficient approaches to map learning have been proposed. Most of them, however, assume that the robot lives on a plane. In this paper, we present a highly efficient maximum-likelihood approach that is able to solve 3-D and 2-D problems. Our approach addresses the so-called graph-based formulation of simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) and can be seen as an extension of Olson's algorithm toward non-flat environments. It applies a novel parameterization of the nodes of the graph that significantly improves the performance of the algorithm and can cope with arbitrary network topologies. The latter allows us to bound the complexity of the algorithm to the size of the mapped area and not to the length of the trajectory. Furthermore, our approach is able to appropriately distribute the roll, pitch, and yaw error over a sequence of poses in 3-D mapping problems. We implemented our technique and compared it with multiple other graph-based SLAM solutions. As we demonstrate in simulated and real-world experiments, our method converges faster than the other approaches and yields accurate maps of the environment.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5164927/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 July 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2009","publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5164927/","dateOfInsertion":"01 September 2009","accessionNumber":"10847388","volume":"10","issue":"3","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Nonlinear Constraint Network Optimization for Efficient Map Learning","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Nonlinear Constraint Network Optimization for Efficient Map Learning","sourcePdf":"tits-grisetti-2026444.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.13542S","chronDate":"Sept.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"6979","isNumber":"5230362","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6979","citationCount":"157","xplore-issue":"5230362","articleId":"5164927","onlineDate":"14 July 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5164929,"authors":[{"name":"Carlo Cagli","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Elettronica e Informazione and the Italian Universities Nanoelectronics Team, Politecnico di Milano, Milan, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/16/5170230/5164929/5164929-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Carlo Cagli was born in Naples, Italy, in 1984.

The set transition is described by a threshold switching process at the broken conductive filament (CF), while the reset transition is viewed as a thermally driven dissolution and/or oxidation of the CF. Set and reset models are finally used for reliability predictions of failure times under constant-voltage stress (read disturb) and elevated-temperature bake (data retention).","doi":"10.1109/TED.2009.2024046","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel5/16/5170230/05164929.pdf","startPage":"1712","endPage":"1720","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TED.2009.2024046","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5170230","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modeling of Set/Reset Operations in NiO-Based Resistive-Switching Memory Devices","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 July 2009","displayDocTitle":"Modeling of Set/Reset Operations in NiO-Based Resistive-Switching Memory Devices","volume":"56","issue":"8","dateOfInsertion":"21 July 2009","accessionNumber":"10791362","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5164929/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5164929/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modeling of Set/Reset Operations in NiO-Based Resistive-Switching Memory Devices","sourcePdf":"ted-ielmini-2024046.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.122488S","chronDate":"Aug.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"16","isNumber":"5170230","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"96","xplore-issue":"5170230","articleId":"5164929","onlineDate":"14 July 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5164940,"authors":[{"name":"Obadamilola Aluko","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA"],"firstName":"Obadamilola","lastName":"Aluko","id":"37571752600"},{"name":"David J.

For a large number of actuators, the associated power amplifier becomes costly and bulky when each actuator is controlled by an independent amplifier. The proposed architecture allows actuators to share power amplifiers, thereby reducing the number of switching devices.

The switching method is controlled by multiple-input multiple-output optimal feedback quantization, which is designed to minimize a weighted measure of quantization distortion.

This paper particularly deals with the integration of a flywheel device as a storage element with a reduced-power diesel generator and accumulators on the hybrid locomotive. First, a power flow model of energy-storage elements (flywheel and accumulator) is developed to achieve the design of the whole traction system. Then, two energy-management strategies based on a frequency approach are proposed. The first strategy led us to a bad exploitation of the flywheel, whereas the second strategy provides an optimal sizing of the storage device. Finally, a comparative study of the proposed structure with a flywheel and the existing structure of the locomotive (diesel generator, accumulators, and ultracapacitors) is presented.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 July 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5164961/","volume":"58","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/5164961/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10903079","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"02 October 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Sizing and Energy Management of a Hybrid Locomotive Based on Flywheel and Accumulators","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sizing and Energy Management of a Hybrid Locomotive Based on Flywheel and Accumulators","sourcePdf":"tvt-sareni-2027328.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.077661S","chronDate":"Oct.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"5277109","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"93","xplore-issue":"5277109","articleId":"5164961","onlineDate":"14 July 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5164962,"authors":[{"name":"Hatem Boujemaa","affiliation":["High Data Rate Communication Techniques and Audio Processing (TECHTRA) Research Unit, SupCom, Higher School of Communication of Tunis (SupCom), Ariana, Tunisia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/5307285/5164962/5164962-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Hatem Boujem\u00e2a (M'09) was born in Tunisia in 1974.

In opportunistic AF cooperative HARQ, packet retransmission is done by the relay offering the highest instantaneous signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the relaying link (source-relay-destination). In opportunistic DF cooperative HARQ, retransmission is done by the relay offering the highest instantaneous SNR of the relay-destination link among the relays that have correctly decoded the transmitted packet by the source. If no relay has correctly decoded, the retransmission is made by the source. Simulation results are also provided to verify the tightness of the derived expressions. The results indicate a significant improvement of packet delivery delays when compared with the absence of cooperation.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/5307285/05164962.pdf","startPage":"4795","endPage":"4804","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2009.2027329","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2009.2027329","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5307285","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5164962","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Delay Analysis of Cooperative Truncated HARQ With Opportunistic Relaying","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Delay","Protocols","Decoding","Automatic repeat request","Fading","Digital relays","Queueing analysis","Signal to noise ratio","Frequency","Cooperative systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automatic repeat request","Nakagami channels","radio networks","stochastic processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["delay analysis","cooperative truncated HARQ","opportunistic relaying","Poisson arriving packets","hybrid automatic repeat request","code combining","block Nakagami-m fading channels","amplify-and-forward relaying","decode-and-forward relaying","packet retransmission","signal-to-noise ratio","source-relay-destination","packet delivery delays"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cooperative communications","hybrid automatic repeat request (HARQ)","Nakagami-$m$ channel","opportunistic relaying"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5164962/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 July 2009","displayDocTitle":"Delay Analysis of Cooperative Truncated HARQ With Opportunistic Relaying","volume":"58","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/5164962/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","accessionNumber":"10966659","dateOfInsertion":"10 November 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Delay Analysis of Cooperative Truncated HARQ With Opportunistic Relaying","sourcePdf":"tvt-boujemaa-2027329.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.069188S","chronDate":"Nov.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"5307285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"43","xplore-issue":"5307285","articleId":"5164962","onlineDate":"14 July 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5164966,"authors":[{"name":"Jinchuan Zheng","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Newcastle, Newcastle, NSW, Australia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/3516/5441215/5164966/5164966-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jinchuan Zheng received the B.Eng. and M.Eng. degrees in mechatronics engineering from Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China, in 1999 and 2002, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, in 2006.","In 2005, he joined the Australian Research Council (ARC) Centre of Excellence for Complex Dynamic Systems and Control, School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, The University of Newcastle, Newcastle, Australia, as a Research Academic.

This result is then used for the design of a 2-DOF controller for a dual-stage actuator (DSA) system to provide desired performance of disturbance rejection and step tracking. The 2-DOF controller is designed based on the doubly coprime factorization approach, with which the closed-loop transfer function is expressed explicitly in terms of design parameters. This greatly simplifies the optimization of design parameters in meeting desired specifications. We further study how to use the design parameters to deal with specific problems in the DSA, i.e., control allocation and trajectory planning. For step tracking beyond the secondary actuator range, a nonlinear controller is also used for the primary actuator to complete the task. Experimental results demonstrate the practical implementation of the DSA control system and verify its effectiveness for step tracking and disturbance rejection and its robust performance under load changes.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/3516/5441215/05164966.pdf","startPage":"339","endPage":"348","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics","doi":"10.1109/TMECH.2009.2025772","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMECH.2009.2025772","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5441215","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5164966","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dual-Stage Actuator Control Design Using a Doubly Coprime Factorization Approach","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Actuators","Control design","Servomechanisms","Control systems","Robust control","Motion control","Transfer functions","Design optimization","Trajectory","Delay"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["closed loop systems","control system synthesis","linear motors","matrix decomposition","nonlinear control systems","piezoelectric actuators","position control","robust control","transfer functions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dual-stage actuator control design","doubly coprime factorization approach","tracking-disturbance rejection problems","independent optimization problems","DOF control framework","disturbance rejection","closed-loop transfer function","trajectory planning","control allocation","nonlinear controller","robust performance"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Doubly coprime factorization (DCF)","dual-stage actuator (DSA)","motion control","2-DOF control"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5164966/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 July 2009","displayDocTitle":"Dual-Stage Actuator Control Design Using a Doubly Coprime Factorization Approach","volume":"15","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/5164966/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2010","accessionNumber":"11220554","dateOfInsertion":"01 April 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dual-Stage Actuator Control Design Using a Doubly Coprime Factorization Approach","sourcePdf":"tmech-zheng-2025772.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.071348S","chronDate":"June  2010","xplore-pub-id":"3516","isNumber":"5441215","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3516","citationCount":"37","xplore-issue":"5441215","articleId":"5164966","onlineDate":"14 July 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5164968,"authors":[{"name":"Duy T.

Taking the maximization of system throughput as the design objective, three novel efficient resource-allocation schemes with reduced computational complexity are proposed under constraints on total bandwidth and transmitted power at the base station (BS). Distinct from existing approaches in the literature, our formulation and solution methods also provide an effective and flexible means to share the available radio spectrum among multicast groups by guaranteeing minimum numbers of subcarriers to be assigned to individual groups. The first two proposed schemes are based on the separate optimization of subcarriers and power, where subcarriers are assigned with the assumption of uniform power distribution, followed by water filling of the total available transmitted power over the determined subcarrier allocation. In the third scheme, which is essentially a modified genetic algorithm (GA), each individual of the entire population represents a subcarrier assignment, whose fitness value is the system sum rate computed on the basis of the power water-filling procedure. Numerical results show that with a flexible spectrum-sharing control mechanism, the proposed designs are able to more flexibly and fairly distribute the total available bandwidth among multicast groups and, at the same time, achieve a high system throughput.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/5307285/05164968.pdf","startPage":"4878","endPage":"4889","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2009.2027331","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2009.2027331","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5307285","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5164968","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient Resource Allocation for OFDMA Multicast Systems With Spectrum-Sharing Control","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resource management","Control systems","Throughput","Bandwidth","Radio spectrum management","Computational complexity","Base stations","Power distribution","Filling","Genetic algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","multicast communication","OFDM modulation","radio spectrum management","resource allocation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["resource allocation","OFDMA multicast systems","spectrum-sharing control","orthogonal frequency-division multiple-access","modified genetic algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Genetic algorithm (GA)","orthogonal frequency-division multiple access (OFDMA)","resource allocation","spectrum-sharing control","wireless multicast"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5164968/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 July 2009","displayDocTitle":"Efficient Resource Allocation for OFDMA Multicast Systems With Spectrum-Sharing Control","volume":"58","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/5164968/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","accessionNumber":"10966616","dateOfInsertion":"10 November 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient Resource Allocation for OFDMA Multicast Systems With Spectrum-Sharing Control","sourcePdf":"tvt-ngo-2027331.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.090707S","chronDate":"Nov.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"5307285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"46","xplore-issue":"5307285","articleId":"5164968","onlineDate":"14 July 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5164969,"authors":[{"name":"Hamid Eslami","affiliation":["University of California, Irvine, Irvine, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/5307285/5164969/5164969-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Hamid Eslami (S'06) received the B.S. degree in 2003 from the University of Tehran, Tehran, Iran, with a focus on communication systems, and the M.S. degree in 2007 from the University of California, Irvine, where he is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree.","His research interests include the design of efficient very large scale integrated architectures for broadband wireless systems."]},"firstName":"Hamid","lastName":"Eslami","id":"37294366300"},{"name":"Sang V.

In this paper, we compare the conventional finite impulse response (FIR)-based emulator versus solely performing the emulation in the frequency domain. We show that for single-input-single-output (SISO) systems, FIR-based emulators are computationally efficient but that the complexity rapidly becomes impractical for larger array sizes. On the other hand, frequency-domain approaches exhibit a fixed initial complexity cost that grows at a reduced rate as a function of the array size, resulting in significant savings in complexity for higher order arrays. As an illustrative example of this approach, field-programmable gate array (FPGA) architecture implementing a sample 3 times 3 MIMO system exhibits resource savings of up to 67% over a similarly constrained FIR approach. The architecture is discussed in detail, and implementation results, as well as laboratory measurements, are presented.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2009.2027439","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/5307285/05164969.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2009.2027439","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5307285","startPage":"4698","endPage":"4709","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design and Implementation of a Scalable Channel Emulator for Wideband MIMO Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5164969","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Design and Implementation of a Scalable Channel Emulator for Wideband MIMO Systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5164969/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 July 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"58","issue":"9","publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","accessionNumber":"10966663","dateOfInsertion":"10 November 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5164969/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design and Implementation of a Scalable Channel Emulator for Wideband MIMO Systems","sourcePdf":"tvt-eltawil-2027439.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.085477S","chronDate":"Nov.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"5307285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"33","xplore-issue":"5307285","articleId":"5164969","onlineDate":"14 July 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5164973,"authors":[{"name":"Michael Unser","affiliation":["Biomedical Imaging Group (BIG), \u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/83/5286712/5164973/5164973-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Michael Unser (M'89\u2013SM'94\u2013F'99) received the M.S.

The important point is that our primary wavelets are quasi-isotropic: they behave like multiscale versions of the fractional Laplace operator from which they are derived, which ensures steerability. We propose to pair these real-valued basis functions with their complex Riesz counterparts to specify a multiresolution monogenic signal analysis. This yields a representation where each wavelet index is associated with a local orientation, an amplitude and a phase. We give a corresponding wavelet-domain method for estimating the underlying instantaneous frequency. We also provide a mechanism for improving the shift and rotation-invariance of the wavelet decomposition and show how to implement the transform efficiently using perfect-reconstruction filterbanks. We illustrate the specific feature-extraction capabilities of the representation and present novel examples of wavelet-domain processing; in particular, a robust, tensor-based analysis of directional image patterns, the demodulation of interferograms, and the reconstruction of digital holograms.","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2009.2027628","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2009.2027628","startPage":"2402","endPage":"2418","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/83/5286712/05164973.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5286712","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiresolution Monogenic Signal Analysis Using the Riesz\u2013Laplace Wavelet Transform","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5164973/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 July 2009","displayDocTitle":"Multiresolution Monogenic Signal Analysis Using the Riesz\u2013Laplace Wavelet Transform","volume":"18","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"13 October 2009","accessionNumber":"10918095","pubMedId":"19605325","publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5164973/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiresolution Monogenic Signal Analysis Using the Riesz\u2013Laplace Wavelet Transform","sourcePdf":"18tip10-munser-2027628.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.11632S","chronDate":"Nov.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"5286712","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"139","xplore-issue":"5286712","articleId":"5164973","onlineDate":"14 July 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5164975,"authors":[{"name":"Ramy H.

In particular, using an appropriately chosen RIWFA parameter, we show that RIWFA yields almost the same sum-rate as price-based IWFA (PIWFA) which requires collaboration of users.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2009.2027396","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/5312990/05164975.pdf","startPage":"4964","endPage":"4970","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2009.2027396","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5312990","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust IWFA for Open-Spectrum Communications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5164975","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 July 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5164975/","displayDocTitle":"Robust IWFA for Open-Spectrum Communications","volume":"57","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"10977233","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5164975/","dateOfInsertion":"17 November 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust IWFA for Open-Spectrum Communications","sourcePdf":"57tsp12-rgohary-2027396.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.144653S","chronDate":"Dec.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"5312990","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"5312990","articleId":"5164975","onlineDate":"14 July 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5164980,"authors":[{"name":"Jack Welch","affiliation":["Radio Astronomy Laboratory, University of California Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Jack","lastName":"Welch","id":"37569538100"},{"name":"Don Backer","affiliation":["Radio Astronomy Laboratory, University of California Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Don","lastName":"Backer","id":"37293824900"},{"name":"Leo Blitz","affiliation":["Radio Astronomy Laboratory, University of California Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Leo","lastName":"Blitz","id":"38274681700"},{"name":"Douglas C.-J.

It is confirmed through computer simulations that the proposed PA scheme outperforms the existing method in terms of both the capacity and the MSE of MIMO relay systems.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2009.2027409","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/5312990/05164986.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2009.2027409","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5312990","startPage":"4852","endPage":"4860","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Joint Source and Relay Power Allocation Scheme for a Class of MIMO Relay Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5164986","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Joint Source and Relay Power Allocation Scheme for a Class of MIMO Relay Systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5164986/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 July 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"57","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"10977236","dateOfInsertion":"17 November 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5164986/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Joint Source and Relay Power Allocation Scheme for a Class of MIMO Relay Systems","sourcePdf":"57tsp12-wzhu-2027409.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.083397S","chronDate":"Dec.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"5312990","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"48","xplore-issue":"5312990","articleId":"5164986","onlineDate":"14 July 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5164990,"authors":[{"name":"Giacomo Oliveri","affiliation":["ELEDIA Research Group, Department of Information and Communication Technologies, University of Trento, Trento, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8/5338646/5164990/5164990-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Giacomo Oliveri (M'09) received the Master's degree in Telecommunications Engineering and the Ph.D. in space science and engineering from the University of Genoa, Italy, in 2005, and 2009, respectively.","He is a member of the ELEDIA Research Group, University of Trento, Trento, Italy, where his research is focused on antenna arrays, electromagnetic propagation in complex environments and numerical methods for electromagnetic problems."]},"firstName":"Giacomo","lastName":"Oliveri","id":"37410828400"},{"name":"Massimo Donelli","affiliation":["ELEDIA Research Group, Department of Information and Communication Technologies, University of Trento, Trento, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8/5338646/5164990/5164990-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Massimo Donelli (M'04) received the Electronic Engineering degree and Ph.D. degree in space science and engineering from the University of Genoa, Italy, in 1998 and 2003, respectively.","He is with the Department of Information and Communication Technology, University of Trento, Trento, Italy.

The proposed approach is based on the fact that the generalized eigenvalue problem is reduced to a standard eigenvalue problem, for which the power method can be easily applied by changing the metric of the vector space. The difficulty of applying the power method to this problem lies in the computational load of the inverse of the square root of a matrix at every update. The proposed algorithm can avoid the computation of eigenvalue decomposition to obtain the inverse of the matrix square root. Experimental results show that the proposed tracking algorithm gives a similar performance in tracking to the direct computation of singular value decomposition (SVD), while the computation order of the proposed algorithm is lower than the SVD.","doi":"10.1109/LSP.2009.2027667","publicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/97/5208449/05165005.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LSP.2009.2027667","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5208449","startPage":"969","endPage":"972","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fast Generalized Eigenvector Tracking Based on the Power Method","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5165005","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Fast Generalized Eigenvector Tracking Based on the Power Method","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5165005/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 July 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"16","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","accessionNumber":"10846967","dateOfInsertion":"25 August 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5165005/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast Generalized Eigenvector Tracking Based on the Power Method","sourcePdf":"16lsp11-ttanaka-2027667.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044793S","chronDate":"Nov.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"97","isNumber":"5208449","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"97","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"5208449","articleId":"5165005","onlineDate":"14 July 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5165017,"authors":[{"name":"Hong-Xing Zheng","affiliation":["Institute of Antenna and Microwave Techniques, Tianjin University of Technology and Education, Tianjin, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8/5338646/5165017/5165017-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Hong-Xing Zheng (M'01) was born in Yinchuan, Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, China.

A formulation for two dimensional problems is presented and its numerical dispersion and stability property are discussed. In our generalized approach, the nonorthogonal grid is used to model the complex region of a scatterer only, whereas the standard FDTD lattice is used for the remaining regions. As a result, accurate griddings with a simple algorithm can be obtained using the new scheme, and the complexity of the algorithm is minimal. The perfectly matched layer (PML) is used to truncate the boundary. To illustrate the theory, a sinusoidal plane wave and a Gaussian pulse that propagates through a space modeled by locally nonorthogonal grids are used, with the stability of the code examined. The radar cross section of a perfectly conducting cylinder with a thin coating, a large curvature, and/or a sharp edge is calculated using the proposed method, and the result is compared with those using other conventional FDTD methods. It is found that the proposed algorithm is much more efficient than its FDTD counterpart when a complex object is analyzed.","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2009.2027618","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8/5338646/05165017.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2009.2027618","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5338646","startPage":"3891","endPage":"3902","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Nonorthogonal ADI-FDTD Algorithm for Solving Two Dimensional Scattering Problems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5165017","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Nonorthogonal ADI-FDTD Algorithm for Solving Two Dimensional Scattering Problems","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5165017/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 July 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"57","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"10998799","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5165017/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Nonorthogonal ADI-FDTD Algorithm for Solving Two Dimensional Scattering Problems","sourcePdf":"tap-zheng-2027618.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.097447S","chronDate":"Dec.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"5338646","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"5338646","articleId":"5165017","onlineDate":"14 July 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5165018,"authors":[{"name":"Dimitrios Dakopoulos","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Assistive Technologies Research Center, Wright State University, Dayton, OH, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5326/5314168/5165018/5165018-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Dimitrios Dakopoulos received the B.S. degree in physics from the National University of Athens, Athens, Greece, and the Ph.D. degree in computer science and engineering from Wright State University, Dayton, OH.","He is currently with the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Assistive Technologies Research Center, Wright State University.

Furthermore, the proposed system employs both time- and frequency-domain spreading to increase the number of users, which is also combined with a user-grouping technique to reduce the effects of multiuser interference. Further system performance improvements can be attained by serially concatenating our proposed scheme with an outer code that is amalgamated with a unity-rate code for the sake of improving the achievable decoding convergence behavior of the proposed system, which is evaluated with the aid of extrinsic information transfer charts. We also propose a novel logarithmic likelihood ratio (LLR) postprocessing technique to improve the iteratively detected system's performance. Explicitly, the proposed system can attain a second-order spatial diversity gain and a frequency diversity gain of order V, where V is the number of subcarriers.

In proving this result, we first prove positive recurrence (stability) of the buffer. The monotone structure proof consists of two steps. First, the constrained MDP (CMDP) is transformed into an unconstrained MDP using a Lagrangian dynamic programming formulation. It is proved that the unconstrained optimal policy is pure and monotonically increasing in the buffer occupancy. It is then shown that the constrained optimal policy is a randomized mixture of two pure transmission policies that are monotone in the buffer state.

A novel PARATREE tensor model is introduced, accompanied with sequential unfolding SVD (SUSVD) algorithm. SUSVD, as the name indicates, applies a matrix singular value decomposition sequentially on the unfolded tensor reshaped from the right hand basis vectors of the SVD of the previous mode. The consequent PARATREE model is related to the well known family of PARAFAC tensor decomposition models. Both of them describe a tensor as a sum of rank-1 tensors, but PARATREE has several advantages over PARAFAC, when it is applied as a lower rank approximation technique. PARATREE is orthogonal (due to SUSVD), fast and reliable to compute, and the order (or rank) of the decomposition can be adaptively adjusted. The low rank PARATREE approximation can be applied for, e.g., reducing computational complexity in inverse problems, measurement noise suppression as well as data compression. The benefits of the proposed algorithm are illustrated through application examples in signal processing in comparison to PARAFAC and HOSVD.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2009.2027740","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/5312990/05165034.pdf","startPage":"4719","endPage":"4733","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5312990","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2009.2027740","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5165034","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sequential Unfolding SVD for Tensors With Applications in Array Signal Processing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5165034/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 July 2009","displayDocTitle":"Sequential Unfolding SVD for Tensors With Applications in Array Signal Processing","volume":"57","issue":"12","accessionNumber":"10977242","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"17 November 2009","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5165034/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sequential Unfolding SVD for Tensors With Applications in Array Signal Processing","sourcePdf":"tsp-salmi-2027740.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.147941S","chronDate":"Dec.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"5312990","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"5312990","articleId":"5165034","onlineDate":"14 July 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5165035,"authors":[{"name":"Mikalai Kisialiou","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA","Circuit and Layout Technology Group, Intel Corporation, Hillsboro, OR, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/5312990/5165035/5165035-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Mikalai Kisialiou received the B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees in applied mathematics and physics from the Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology, Moscow, Russia, in 2001.

As the PD network is added to the FB loop, the linearization performance and system tolerance are further improved because of more accurate PD signal extraction.

In the case of filterless CDAs, IMD remains largely unexplored, and the mechanism thereof is largely unknown. This paper presents an analytical modeling of IMD for the prevalent first- and second-order filterless CDAs and shows that the dominant mechanisms of the former is phase error while of the latter is duty-cycle error. By means of multidimensional Fourier series analysis, analytical expressions for the IMD components and thereafter, the IMD expression for these CDAs, are derived. The derived expressions depict that the IMDs of these CDAs are significant, and the IMD of the first-order filterless CDA, in spite of its lower noise-suppression attribute, is somewhat unexpectedly superior to the second-order filterless CDA. Furthermore, the derived expressions delineate the parameters that affect IMD and are insightful to designers to optimize/vary pertinent parameters to reduce IMD. The derived IMD expressions are verified against HSPICE simulations and on the basis of measurements on a prototype CDA IC and other CDAs realized discretely.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5165049/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 July 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5165049/","dateOfInsertion":"08 February 2010","publicationDate":"Feb. 2010","accessionNumber":"11105800","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"57","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"IMD of Closed-Loop Filterless Class D Amplifiers","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"IMD of Closed-Loop Filterless Class D Amplifiers","sourcePdf":"tcsi-shu-2027801.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.056296S","chronDate":"Feb.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"5410062","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"5410062","articleId":"5165049","onlineDate":"14 July 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5165050,"authors":[{"name":"Gianmario Pellegrino","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Politecnico di Torino, Turin, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/28/5247116/5165050/5165050-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Gianmario Pellegrino (M'06) received the M.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from the Politecnico di Torino, Turin, Italy, in 1998 and 2002, respectively.","He was a Guest Researcher at Aalborg University, Denmark, in 2002.

The output torque is regulated by the coordinated control of the stator flux amplitude and the current component in quadrature with the flux, and it is implemented in the stator flux reference frame. The control system guarantees maximum torque production taking into account voltage and current limits, in particular in case of large dc-link variations. The field-oriented control does not necessarily require an accurate magnetic model of the IPM motor, and it is able to exploit the full inverter voltage at different dc-link levels with no additional voltage control loop. The feasibility of the proposed control method is investigated in discrete-time simulation, then tested on a laboratory rig, and finally implemented on board of an electric scooter prototype. The motor under test is an IPM permanent-magnet-assisted synchronous reluctance machine, with high-saliency and limited permanent-magnet flux.","doi":"10.1109/TIA.2009.2027167","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/28/5247116/05165050.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIA.2009.2027167","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5247116","startPage":"1619","endPage":"1627","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Direct Flux Field-Oriented Control of IPM Drives With Variable DC Link in the Field-Weakening Region","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5165050","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Direct Flux Field-Oriented Control of IPM Drives With Variable DC Link in the Field-Weakening Region","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.-oct.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5165050/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 July 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"45","issue":"5","publicationDate":"Sept.-oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"10878838","dateOfInsertion":"18 September 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5165050/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Direct Flux Field-Oriented Control of IPM Drives With Variable DC Link in the Field-Weakening Region","sourcePdf":"tia-pellegrino-2027167.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.093929S","chronDate":"Sept.-oct.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"28","isNumber":"5247116","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"28","citationCount":"72","xplore-issue":"5247116","articleId":"5165050","onlineDate":"14 July 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5165061,"authors":[{"name":"Thomas Friedli","affiliation":["Power Electronic Systems Laboratory, Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, Zurich, Switzerland"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/28/5247116/5165061/5165061-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Thomas Friedli (S'06) received the M.Sc. degree (with distinction) in electrical engineering from the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH) Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland, in 2005.

The comparison is carried out for two-, three-, and four-phase BSM concepts based on performance indexes such as motor losses, losses in the power electronics, and voltampere requirements depending on the required magnetic bearing force and the motor torque.

This unified framework classifies most commonly used design objectives such as the minimal mean-square error and the maximal mutual information into two categories: Schur-concave and Schur-convex functions. We prove that for Schur-concave objective functions, the optimal source precoding matrix and relay amplifying matrix jointly diagonalize the source-relay-destination channel matrix and convert the multicarrier MIMO relay channel into parallel single-input single-output (SISO) relay channels. While for Schur-convex objectives, such joint diagonalization occurs after a specific rotation of the source precoding matrix. After the optimal structure of the source and relay matrices is determined, the linear nonregenerative relay design problem boils down to the issue of power loading among the resulting SISO relay channels. We show that this power loading problem can be efficiently solved by an alternating technique. Numerical examples demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/5312990/05165072.pdf","startPage":"4837","endPage":"4851","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2009.2027779","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2009.2027779","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5312990","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Unified Framework for Optimizing Linear Nonregenerative Multicarrier MIMO Relay Communication Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 July 2009","displayDocTitle":"A Unified Framework for Optimizing Linear Nonregenerative Multicarrier MIMO Relay Communication Systems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5165072/","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"17 November 2009","publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"10977222","volume":"57","issue":"12","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Unified Framework for Optimizing Linear Nonregenerative Multicarrier MIMO Relay Communication Systems","sourcePdf":"57tsp12-yrong-2027779.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.048107S","chronDate":"Dec.  2009","isNumber":"5312990","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"296","articleId":"5165072","onlineDate":"14 July 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5165074,"authors":[{"name":"Kenny Seungwoo Ryu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Mississippi, University Park, MS, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8/5338646/5165074/5165074-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Kenny Seungwoo Ryu (S'08) received the B.S. degree in radio and communication engineering from Yonsei University, Korea, in 1999 and the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from Mississippi State University, University, in 2004.

A comprehensive conductance and delay analysis of GNR interconnects is presented in this paper. Using a simple tight-binding model and the linear response Landauer formula, the conductance model of GNR is derived. Several GNR structures are examined, and the conductance among them and other interconnect materials [e.g., copper (Cu), tungsten (W), and carbon nanotubes (CNTs)] is compared. The impact of different model parameters (i.e., bandgap, mean free path, Fermi level, and edge specularity) on the conductance is discussed. Both global and local GNR interconnect delays are analyzed using an RLC equivalent circuit model. Intercalation doping for multilayer GNRs is proposed, and it is shown that in order to match (or better) the performance of Cu or CNT bundles at either the global or local level, multiple zigzag-edged GNR layers along with proper intercalation doping must be used and near-specular nanoribbon edge should be achieved. However, intercalation-doped multilayer zigzag GNRs can have better performance than that of W, implying possible application as local interconnects in some cases. Thus, this paper identifies the on-chip interconnect domains where GNRs can be employed and provides valuable insights into the process technology development for GNR interconnects.","doi":"10.1109/TED.2009.2024254","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel5/16/5170230/05165081.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TED.2009.2024254","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5170230","startPage":"1567","endPage":"1578","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modeling, Analysis, and Design of Graphene Nano-Ribbon Interconnects","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5165081","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Modeling, Analysis, and Design of Graphene Nano-Ribbon Interconnects","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5165081/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 July 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"56","issue":"8","publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","accessionNumber":"10791374","dateOfInsertion":"21 July 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5165081/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modeling, Analysis, and Design of Graphene Nano-Ribbon Interconnects","sourcePdf":"ted-banerjee-2024254.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.18085S","chronDate":"Aug.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"16","isNumber":"5170230","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"278","xplore-issue":"5170230","articleId":"5165081","onlineDate":"14 July 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5165082,"authors":[{"name":"Kavitha P.

This paper proposes a new discriminative filter bank (FB) common spatial pattern algorithm to extract subject-specific FB for MI classification. The proposed method enhances the classification accuracy in BCI competition III dataset IVa and competition IV dataset IIb. Compared to the performance offered by the existing FB-based method, the proposed algorithm offers error rate reductions of 17.42% and 8.9% for BCI competition datasets III and IV, respectively.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A New Discriminative Common Spatial Pattern Method for Motor Imagery Brain\u2013Computer Interfaces","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","doi":"10.1109/TBME.2009.2026181","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/5297567/05165082.pdf","startPage":"2730","endPage":"2733","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBME.2009.2026181","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5297567","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5165082","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5165082/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 July 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2009","displayDocTitle":"A New Discriminative Common Spatial Pattern Method for Motor Imagery Brain\u2013Computer Interfaces","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"56","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/5165082/","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2009","publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","accessionNumber":"10950221","pubMedId":"19605314","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A New Discriminative Common Spatial Pattern Method for Motor Imagery Brain\u2013Computer Interfaces","sourcePdf":"tbme-thomas-2026181.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.064078S","chronDate":"Nov.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"10","isNumber":"5297567","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"165","xplore-issue":"5297567","articleId":"5165082","onlineDate":"14 July 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5165089,"authors":[{"name":"Kinam Kim","affiliation":["Semiconductor Research and Development Center, Samsung Electronics Company Limited, Hwaseong, South Korea"],"firstName":"Kinam","lastName":"Kim","id":"37280248100"},{"name":"Jooyoung Lee","affiliation":["Semiconductor Research and Development Center, Samsung Electronics Company Limited, Hwaseong, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jooyoung","lastName":"Lee","id":"38546646300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0741-3106"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0563"}],"articleNumber":"5165089","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":86,"citationCountPatent":5,"totalDownloads":1646},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Electron Devices Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/eds/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Probability distribution","Leakage current","Energy states","Distribution functions","Tunneling","Energy consumption","Failure analysis","Density measurement","Semiconductor device measurement","Size measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DRAM chips","leakage currents","nanoelectronics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data retention time","nanoscaled DRAM","gate-induced drain leakage current","trap energy dispersion","full chip retention failure curve","interface trap density","scaled-down cell size"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Data retention time","DRAM","gate-induced drain leakage (GIDL) currents","recess channel array transistor (RCAT)","trap-assisted tunneling (TAT)"]}],"abstract":"Data retention time for ultimate DRAMs with an extremely scaled-down cell size has been investigated. The entire memory cells can be discretely categorized by two groups: leaky cells or normal cells, and the main distribution representing the normal cells shows longer than 40 s of the mean retention time. The leaky cells are mainly originated by trap-assisted gate-induced drain leakage currents depending on trap energy dispersion. Through analyses of full chip retention failure curves and interface trap density ( Dit*) measurements, we propose that the tail distribution will be diminished and separated from the main distribution as the cell size shrinks into a true nanoscale. As a result, the retention time is eventually to be determined by the main distribution function only.","doi":"10.1109/LED.2009.2023248","publicationTitle":"IEEE Electron Device

Simulations of the beam propagation in the amplifier based on the Collins integral and the measured aspherical components of the disk reproduce well the measured beam intensity profiles (with higher order intensity moments) and gains.

Final confusion network combination yielded 9.1% character error rate on the DARPA GALE 2007 official evaluation, the best Mandarin recognition system in that year.","doi":"10.1109/TASL.2009.2014263","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/10376/5165109/05165110.pdf","startPage":"1253","endPage":"1262","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TASL.2009.2014263","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5165109","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Building A Highly Accurate Mandarin Speech Recognizer With Language-Independent Technologies and Language-Dependent Modules","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5165110","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 July 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5165110/","displayDocTitle":"Building A Highly Accurate Mandarin Speech Recognizer With Language-Independent Technologies and Language-Dependent Modules","volume":"17","issue":"7","publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10764152","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5165110/","dateOfInsertion":"14 July 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Building A Highly Accurate Mandarin Speech Recognizer With Language-Independent Technologies and Language-Dependent Modules","sourcePdf":"17tasl04-mhwang-2014263.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.083993S","chronDate":"Sept.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"10376","isNumber":"5165109","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10376","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5165109","articleId":"5165110","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5165112,"authors":[{"name":"Jen-Tzung Chien","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/10376/5165109/5165112/5165112-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jen-Tzung Chien (S'97\u2013A'98\u2013M'99\u2013SM'04) received the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from the National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan, in 1997.","Since 1997, he has been with the Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan, where he is currently a Professor.

The factor analysis (FA) principle is adopted to explore the common factors from acoustic features. The streaming regularities in building HMMs are governed by the correlation between cepstral features, which is inherent in common factors. Those features corresponding to the same factor are generated by the identical HMM state. Accordingly, the multiple Markov chains are adopted to characterize the variation trends in different dimensions of cepstral vectors. An FA streamed HMM (FASHMM) method is developed to relax the assumption of standard HMM topology, namely, that all features of a speech frame perform the same state emission. The proposed FASHMM is more flexible than the streamed factorial HMM (SFHMM) where the streaming was empirically determined. To reduce the number of factor loading matrices in FA, we evaluated the similarity between individual matrices to find the optimal solution to parameter clustering of FA models. A new decoding algorithm was presented to perform FASHMM speech recognition. FASHMM carries out the streamed Markov chains for a sequence of multivariate Gaussian mixture observations through the state transitions of the partitioned vectors. In the experiments, the proposed method reduced the recognition error rates significantly when compared with the standard HMM and SFHMM methods.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Acoustic Factor Analysis for Streamed Hidden Markov Modeling","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","doi":"10.1109/TASL.2009.2014891","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/10376/5165109/05165112.pdf","startPage":"1279","endPage":"1291","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TASL.2009.2014891","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5165109","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5165112","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5165112/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 July 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2009","displayDocTitle":"Acoustic Factor Analysis for Streamed Hidden Markov Modeling","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"17","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/5165112/","dateOfInsertion":"14 July 2009","publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10764154","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Acoustic Factor Analysis for Streamed Hidden Markov Modeling","sourcePdf":"17tasl04-jchien-2014891.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.071688S","chronDate":"Sept.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"10376","isNumber":"5165109","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10376","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5165109","articleId":"5165112","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5165116,"authors":[{"name":"Mohamed Afify","affiliation":["Orange Laboratory, Cairo, Egypt"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/10376/5165109/5165116/5165116-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Mohamed Afify (M'98) received the B.Sc., M.Sc., and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from Cairo University, Giza, Egypt, in 1987, 1992, and 1995, respectively.","He is currently the Head of Voice and Multimedia Services, Orange Lab, Cairo, Egypt.

The idea is based on constructing a Gaussian mixture model for the joint distribution of the clean and noisy features and using this distribution to predict the clean speech during testing. The proposed mapping is called stereo-based stochastic mapping (SSM). Two different estimators are considered. One is iterative and is based on the maximum \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">a</i>\n \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">posteriori</i>\n (MAP) criterion while the other uses the minimum mean square error (MMSE) criterion. The resulting estimators are effectively a mixture of linear transforms weighted by component posteriors, and the parameters of the linear transformations are derived from the joint distribution. Compared to the uncompensated result, the proposed method results in 45% relative improvement in word error rate (WER) for digit recognition in the car. In the same setting, SSM outperforms SPLICE and gives similar results to MMSE compensation of Huang A 66% relative improvement in word error rate (WER) is observed when applied in conjunction with multistyle training (MST) for large vocabulary English speech recognition in a real environment. Also, the combination of the proposed mapping with CMLLR leads to about 38% relative improvement in performance compared to CMLLR alone for real field data.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/10376/5165109/05165116.pdf","startPage":"1325","endPage":"1334","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Stereo-Based Stochastic Mapping for Robust Speech Recognition","doi":"10.1109/TASL.2009.2018017","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5165109","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TASL.2009.2018017","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5165116","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5165116/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 July 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2009","displayDocTitle":"Stereo-Based Stochastic Mapping for Robust Speech Recognition","dateOfInsertion":"14 July 2009","publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10764158","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"17","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/5165116/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Stereo-Based Stochastic Mapping for Robust Speech Recognition","sourcePdf":"17tasl05-mafify-2018017.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.127575S","chronDate":"Sept.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"10376","isNumber":"5165109","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10376","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"5165109","articleId":"5165116","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5165118,"authors":[{"name":"Dong Yu","affiliation":["Microsoft Research Limited, Redmond, WA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/10376/5165109/5165118/5165118-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Dong Yu (M'97\u2013SM'06) received the B.S. degree (with honors) in electrical engineering from Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China, the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, the M.S. degree in computer science from Indiana University at Bloomington, and the Ph.D. degree in computer science from University of Idaho, Moscow.","He joined Microsoft Research, Redmond, WA, in 1998 and Microsoft Speech Research Group in 2002, where he is a Researcher.

Our framework differs from the VPHMM proposed by Cui and Gong (2007) in that piecewise spline interpolation instead of global polynomial regression is used to represent the dependency of the HMM parameters on the conditioning parameters, and a more effective functional form is used to model the variances. Our framework unifies and extends the conventional discrete VPHMM.

An important problem in separation of pitched musical sounds is the estimation of time-frequency regions where harmonics overlap. In this paper, we propose a sinusoidal modeling-based separation system that can effectively resolve overlapping harmonics. Our strategy is based on the observations that harmonics of the same source have correlated amplitude envelopes and that the change in phase of a harmonic is related to the instrument's pitch. We use these two observations in a least squares estimation framework for separation of overlapping harmonics. The system directly distributes mixture energy for harmonics that are unobstructed by other sources. Quantitative evaluation of the proposed system is shown when ground truth pitch information is available, when rough pitch estimates are provided in the form of a MIDI score, and finally, when a multi pitch tracking algorithm is used. We also introduce a technique to improve the accuracy of rough pitch estimates. Results show that the proposed system significantly outperforms related monaural musical sound separation systems.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Amplitude modulation","Sparse matrices","Psychoacoustic models","Image analysis","Instruments","Music information retrieval","Computer science","Independent component analysis","Least squares approximation","Signal processing algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplitude modulation","audio signal processing","frequency estimation","harmonic analysis","least squares approximations","music","source separation","time-frequency analysis","tracking"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["monaural musical sound separation","common amplitude modulation","pitch amplitude modulation","time-frequency region estimation","sinusoidal modeling","harmonics overlap separation","least squares estimation framework","MIDI score","multi pitch tracking algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Common amplitude modulation (CAM)","musical sound separation","sinusoidal modeling","time\u2013frequency masking","underdetermined sound separation"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TASL.2009.2020886","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/10376/5165109/05165119.pdf","startPage":"1361","endPage":"1371","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5165109","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TASL.2009.2020886","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Monaural Musical Sound Separation Based on Pitch and Common Amplitude Modulation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5165119","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Monaural Musical Sound Separation Based on Pitch and Common Amplitude Modulation","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5165119/","volume":"17","issue":"7","publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5165119/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"10764161","dateOfInsertion":"14 July 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 July 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Monaural Musical Sound Separation Based on Pitch and Common Amplitude Modulation","sourcePdf":"17tasl05-jwoodruff-2020886.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.069541S","chronDate":"Sept.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"10376","isNumber":"5165109","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10376","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"5165109","articleId":"5165119","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5165163,"authors":[{"name":"Alexandros G.

We further exploit these geometrical properties to devise an improved decoding algorithm with the same order of complexity as LP decoding that provably performs better. The method is very simple: it first applies ordinary LP decoding, and when it fails, it proceeds by guessing facets of the polytope, and then resolving the linear program on these facets. While the LP decoder succeeds only if the ML codeword has the highest likelihood over all pseudocodewords, we prove that the proposed algorithm, when applied to suitable expander codes, succeeds unless there exists a certain number of pseudocodewords, all adjacent to the ML codeword on the LP decoding polytope, and with higher likelihood than the ML codeword. We then describe an extended algorithm, still with polynomial complexity, that succeeds as long as there are at most polynomially many pseudocodewords above the ML codeword.","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2009.2023735","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/5165162/05165163.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2009.2023735","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5165162","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","startPage":"3479","endPage":"3487","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 July 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Guessing Facets: Polytope Structure and Improved LP Decoder","volume":"55","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/5165163/","dateOfInsertion":"14 July 2009","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"10763991","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5165163/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Guessing Facets: Polytope Structure and Improved LP Decoder","sourcePdf":"55tit08-adimakis-2023735.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.076808S","chronDate":"Aug.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"5165162","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"5165162","articleId":"5165163","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5165164,"authors":[{"name":"Amichai Sanderovich","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Technion\u2013Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, Israel"],"bio":{"p":["Amichai Sanderovich (S'03) received the B.Sc.

Namely, the cell sites are linked to the central joint processor via lossless links with finite capacity. The new rates are based on compress-and-forward schemes combined with local decoding. Further, the cellular network is abstracted by symmetric models, which render analytical treatment plausible. For this family of idealistic models, achievable rates are presented for both Gaussian and fading channels. The rates are given in closed form for the classical Wyner model and the soft-handover model. These rates are then demonstrated to be rather close to the optimal unlimited backhaul joint processing rates, even for modest backhaul capacities, supporting the potential gain offered by the joint MCP approach. Particular attention is also given to the low-signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) characterization of these rates through which the effect of the limited backhaul network is explicitly revealed. In addition, the rate at which the backhaul capacity should scale in order to maintain the original high-SNR characterization of an unlimited backhaul capacity system is found.","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2009.2023732","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/5165162/05165164.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2009.2023732","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5165162","startPage":"3457","endPage":"3478","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Uplink Macro Diversity of Limited Backhaul Cellular Network","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5165164","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Uplink Macro Diversity of Limited Backhaul Cellular Network","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5165164/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 July 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"55","issue":"8","publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","accessionNumber":"10763992","dateOfInsertion":"14 July 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5165164/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Uplink Macro Diversity of Limited Backhaul Cellular Network","sourcePdf":"55tit08-asanderovich-2023732.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.123081S","chronDate":"Aug.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"5165162","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"144","xplore-issue":"5165162","articleId":"5165164","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5165166,"authors":[{"name":"Charalambos D.

The envelope of this family gives a relatively tight lower bound in terms of the number of users, spreading gain, and the noise distribution. The derivation methods for the noiseless and the noisy channels are different but when the noise variance goes to zero, the noisy channel bound approaches the noiseless case. The behavior of the lower bound shows that for small noise power, the number of users can be much more than the spreading gain without any significant loss of information (overloaded CDMA). A conjectured upper bound is also derived under the usual assumption that the users send out equally likely binary bits in the presence of additive noise with an arbitrary distribution. As the noise level increases, and/or, the ratio of the number of users and the spreading gain increases, the conjectured upper bound approaches the lower bound. We have also derived asymptotic limits of our bounds that can be compared to a formula that Tanaka obtained using techniques from statistical physics; his bound is close to that of our conjectured upper bound for large scale systems.","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2009.2023756","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/5165162/05165172.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2009.2023756","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5165162","startPage":"3577","endPage":"3593","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bounds on the Sum Capacity of Synchronous Binary CDMA Channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5165172","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Bounds on the Sum Capacity of Synchronous Binary CDMA Channels","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5165172/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 July 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"55","issue":"8","publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","accessionNumber":"10764000","dateOfInsertion":"14 July 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5165172/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bounds on the Sum Capacity of Synchronous Binary CDMA Channels","sourcePdf":"55tit08-fmarvasti-2023756.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.127264S","chronDate":"Aug.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"5165162","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"5165162","articleId":"5165172","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5165174,"authors":[{"name":"Alenka G.

This channel model accounts for the dependence of the intrinsic thermal noise on the data due to the heat dissipation associated with the transmission of data in electronic circuits: the data determine the transmitted signal, which in turn heats up the circuit and thus influences the power of the thermal noise. The capacity of this channel (both with and without feedback) is studied at low transmit powers and at high transmit powers. At low transmit powers, the slope of the capacity-versus-power curve at zero is computed and it is shown that the heating-up effect is beneficial. At high transmit powers, conditions are determined under which the capacity is bounded, i.e., under which the capacity does not grow to infinity as the allowed average power tends to infinity.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Channels That Heat Up","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2009.2023753","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/5165162/05165190.pdf","startPage":"3594","endPage":"3612","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2009.2023753","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5165162","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5165190","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5165190/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 July 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2009","displayDocTitle":"Channels That Heat Up","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"55","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/5165190/","dateOfInsertion":"14 July 2009","publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","accessionNumber":"10764018","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Channels That Heat Up","sourcePdf":"55tit08-tkoch-2023753.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.086251S","chronDate":"Aug.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"5165162","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"5165162","articleId":"5165190","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5165193,"authors":[{"name":"Teng Li","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Notre Dame, Notre Dame, IN, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Teng Li (S'05\u2013M'07) received the B.S. degree from Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China, in 1999 and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in 2003, and 2007, respectively, from the University of Notre Dame, Notre Dame, IN, all in electrical engineering.","From 1999 to 2000, he was a software engineer in Ericsson Communication Software Research and Development Company, China.

In CDMA signature optimization, for a particular user, the receiver selects a signature vector from a codebook to best avoid interference from other users, and then feeds the corresponding index back to the specified user. For MIMO beamforming vector selection, the receiver chooses a beamforming vector from a given codebook to maximize the instantaneous information rate, and feeds back the corresponding index to the transmitter. These two problems are dual: both can be modeled as selecting a unit norm vector from a finite size codebook to ldquomatchrdquo a randomly generated Gaussian matrix. Assuming that the feedback link is rate limited, our main result is an exact asymptotic performance formula where the length of the signature/beamforming vector, the dimensions of interference/channel matrix, and the feedback rate approach infinity with constant ratios. The proof rests on the large deviations of the underlying random matrix ensemble. Further, we show that random codebooks generated from the isotropic distribution are asymptotically optimal not only on average, but also in probability.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/5165162/05165195.pdf","startPage":"3651","endPage":"3669","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2009.2023717","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2009.2023717","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5165162","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5165195","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Effect of Finite Rate Feedback on CDMA Signature Optimization and MIMO Beamforming Vector Selection","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Feedback","Multiaccess communication","MIMO","Array signal processing","Feeds","Transmitters","Information rates","H infinity control","Multiple access interference","Base stations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","code division multiple access","interference suppression","matrix algebra","MIMO communication","optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["finite rate feedback effect","CDMA signature optimization","MIMO beamforming vector selection","code-division multiple-access","asymptotic performance formula","interference avoidance","channel matrix","random matrix ensemble","random codebook generation","isotropic distribution"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Beamforming","code-division multiple access (CDMA)","finite rate feedback","large deviations","multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)","random matrix theory","signature optimization"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5165195/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 July 2009","displayDocTitle":"The Effect of Finite Rate Feedback on CDMA Signature Optimization and MIMO Beamforming Vector Selection","volume":"55","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/5165195/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","accessionNumber":"10764023","dateOfInsertion":"14 July 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Effect of Finite Rate Feedback on CDMA Signature Optimization and MIMO Beamforming Vector Selection","sourcePdf":"55tit08-wdai-2023717.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.140931S","chronDate":"Aug.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"5165162","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"5165162","articleId":"5165195","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5165196,"authors":[{"name":"Xiqi Gao","affiliation":["National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, South-East University, Nanjing, China"],"bio":{"p":["Xiqi Gao (SM'07) received the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from Southeast University, Nanjing, China, in 1997.","He joined the Department of Radio Engineering, Southeast University, in April 1992.

We consider a general jointly correlated MIMO channel model, which does not require separable spatial correlations at the transmitter and receiver. For this model, we first derive a closed-form tight upper bound for the ergodic capacity, which reveals a simple and interesting relationship in terms of the matrix permanent of the eigenmode channel coupling matrix and embraces many existing results in the literature as special cases. Based on this closed-form and tractable upper bound expression, we then employ convex optimization techniques to develop low-complexity power allocation solutions involving only the channel statistics. Necessary and sufficient optimality conditions are derived, from which we develop an iterative water-filling algorithm with guaranteed convergence. Simulations demonstrate the tightness of the capacity upper bound and the near-optimal performance of the proposed low-complexity transmitter optimization approach.","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2009.2023737","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5165162","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2009.2023737","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/5165162/05165196.pdf","startPage":"3735","endPage":"3750","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Statistical Eigenmode Transmission Over Jointly Correlated MIMO Channels","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 July 2009","displayDocTitle":"Statistical Eigenmode Transmission Over Jointly Correlated MIMO Channels","volume":"55","issue":"8","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2009","dateOfInsertion":"14 July 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5165196/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","accessionNumber":"10764024","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5165196/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Statistical Eigenmode Transmission Over Jointly Correlated MIMO Channels","sourcePdf":"55tit08-xgao-2023737.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.113975S","chronDate":"Aug.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"5165162","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"103","xplore-issue":"5165162","articleId":"5165196","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5165198,"authors":[{"name":"Zhuo Li","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Integrated Services Networks, Xidian University, Xi'an, Shanxi, China"],"bio":{"p":["Zhuo Li was born in Shannxi Province, China, in 1980.

SLM requires the transmission of several side information bits for each data block, which results in some data rate loss. These bits must generally be channel-encoded because they are particularly critical to the error performance of the system. This increases the system complexity and transmission delay, and decreases the data rate even further. In this paper, we propose a novel SLM method for which no side information needs to be sent.

To further enhance the attainable system performance and to maximise the coding advantage of the proposed transmission scheme, the system is also combined with multi-dimensional sphere packing (SP) modulation. Additionally, we quantify the capacity of the proposed multi-functional MIMO aided multi-dimensional SP arrangement and propose a novel technique of computing an upper limit on the achievable bandwidth efficiency of the system based on extrinsic information transfer (EXIT) charts. Further system performance improvements can be attained by serially concatenating our proposed scheme with an outer code together with a unity-rate code (URC), where three different receiver structures are created by varying the iterative detection configuration of the constituent decoders/demappers.

Due to the adoption of ULA at the BS and the narrowband signal assumption, CFOs of different users can be separated by their spatial information. Thus, unlike existing blind alternatives, which are subject to some specific carrier assignment schemes (CAS) or rely on null subcarriers, our proposed method can support generalized carrier assignment scheme (GCAS) and fully loaded systems, i.e., all subcarriers are available to users. Consequently, the dynamic channel assignment is available and the bandwidth efficiency is higher. Moreover, the closed-form directions of arrival (DOAs) of all active users are also obtained, which can be used in downlink beamforming in frequency division duplex (FDD) systems.

This results in a product fading channel, which negatively affects the performance of the system. The challenge is to evaluate the performance of the system, in terms of the average bit error probability (BEP). In this paper, through the use of the moment generating function, we derive expressions for the average BEP and an upper bound for M-ary phase-shift keying (M-PSK) modulation with maximal-ratio combining (MRC) diversity over the product RiciantimesRician channel. The results are expressed as double summations in terms of the generalized hypergeometric function, which can be computed using standard commercial software. For a large Rician factor, the expression is simplified to a single summation. Numerical results are obtained from the derived expressions and compared with simulation results. They show very good agreement for various Rician factors and the number of diversity branches. The upper bound is also evaluated and shown to be reasonably tight.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2009.080208","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/5165281/05165291.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2009.080208","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5165281","startPage":"3360","endPage":"3364","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance of M-PSK in mobile satellite communication over combined ionospheric scintillation and flat fading channels with MRC diversity","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5165291","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Performance of M-PSK in mobile satellite communication over combined ionospheric scintillation and flat fading channels with MRC diversity","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5165291/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"8","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 2009","accessionNumber":"10792374","dateOfInsertion":"11 April 2019","htmlLink":"/document/5165291/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance of M-PSK in mobile satellite communication over combined ionospheric scintillation and flat fading channels with MRC diversity","sourcePdf":"3360-tw0907-supnithi.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.063471S","chronDate":"July  2009","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"5165281","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"5165281","articleId":"5165291","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5165292,"authors":[{"name":"Naveed Ul Hassan","affiliation":["Telecommunications Department, Ecole Sup\u00e9rieure d Electricit\u00e9, Gif-Sur-Yvette, France"],"firstName":"Naveed Ul","lastName":"Hassan","id":"37530376200"},{"name":"Mohamad Assaad","affiliation":["Telecommunications Department, Ecole Sup\u00e9rieure d Electricit\u00e9, Gif-Sur-Yvette, France"],"firstName":"Mohamad","lastName":"Assaad","id":"37269223500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1536-1276"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2248"}],"articleNumber":"5165292","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":29,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":828},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/organizations/society/sp/index.html#pub"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resource management","Downlink","Array signal processing","MIMO","Quality of service","Interference constraints","Frequency conversion","Signal to noise ratio","Iterative algorithms","Adaptive systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","communication complexity","convex programming","interference suppression","MIMO communication","minimisation","OFDM modulation","quality of service","radiofrequency interference","resource allocation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low complexity margin adaptive resource allocation","downlink multiuser MIMO-OFDMA system","multiple input multiple output system","orthogonal frequency division multiple access system","base station","quality of service","power minimization","beamforming technique","multiuser inter-stream interference cancellation","sub-optimal two-step solution","subcarrier allocation","power allocation","convex optimization problem"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Multiple input multiple output (MIMO), orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA), zeroforcing, beamforming, margin adaptive, resource allocation.

The proposed scheme utilizes antenna array redundancy to deliberately randomize the transmitted signals to prevent eavesdropping. Motivated by their idea, in this paper we design a physical-layer transmission scheme to achieve LPI in cooperative systems. There are two major differences in cooperative systems: (1) each relay node may have only one antenna that can not provide antenna array redundancy for signal randomization; (2) there may exist timing errors due to the asynchronous nature of cooperative systems. Considering the two differences, we propose a distributed differentially encoded OFDM transmission scheme with deliberate signal randomization to prevent eavesdropping and exploit the available spatial and frequency diversities in asynchronous cooperative systems. We use diagonal unitary codes to perform the differential encoding in the frequency domain over subcarriers within each OFDM block, or we use general (not necessarily diagonal) unitary codes to perform the differential encoding in the frequency domain across several OFDM blocks. By some deliberate signal randomization, the eavesdropper can not detect the transmitted symbols, while the authorized receiver can perform differential decoding successfully without the knowledge of the channels or the timing errors.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A distributed differentially encoded OFDM scheme for asynchronous cooperative systems with low probability of interception","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2009.080365","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/5165281/05165293.pdf","startPage":"3372","endPage":"3379","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2009.080365","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5165281","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5165293","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5165293/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 July 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2009","displayDocTitle":"A distributed differentially encoded OFDM scheme for asynchronous cooperative systems with low probability of interception","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"8","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/5165293/","dateOfInsertion":"21 July 2009","publicationDate":"July 2009","accessionNumber":"10792344","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A distributed differentially encoded OFDM scheme for asynchronous cooperative systems with low probability of interception","sourcePdf":"3372-tw0907-li.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.09697S","chronDate":"July  2009","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"5165281","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"5165281","articleId":"5165293","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5165294,"authors":[{"name":"Mai Vu","affiliation":["McGill University, Canada","Harvard School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, USA"],"firstName":"Mai","lastName":"Vu","id":"37268913400"},{"name":"Natasha Devroye","affiliation":["Harvard School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, USA","University of Illinois, Chicago, USA"],"firstName":"Natasha","lastName":"Devroye","id":"37541445700"},{"name":"Vahid Tarokh","affiliation":["Harvard School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, USA"],"firstName":"Vahid","lastName":"Tarokh","id":"37271249900"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1536-1276"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2248"}],"articleNumber":"5165294","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":130,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":985},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/organizations/society/sp/index.html#pub"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radio transmitters","Licenses","Multiple access interference","Power system protection","Information geometry","TV broadcasting","Frequency measurement","Sea measurements","Time measurement","White spaces"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","interference (signal)","probability","radio receivers","radio transmitters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive networks","single primary transmitter","multiple secondary","primary exclusive region","outage probability","primary receivers","distributed cognitive users","aggregated interference","network geometry"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cognitive networks, exclusive regions, outage probability, primary and secondary transmissions, spectrum sharing, secondary access, TV bands."]}],"abstract":"We study a cognitive network consisting of a single primary transmitter and multiple secondary, or cognitive, users. The primary transmitter, located at the center of the network, communicates with primary receivers within a disc called the primary exclusive region (PER). Inside the PER, no cognitive users may transmit, in order to guarantee an outage probability for the primary receivers within. Outside the PER, uniformly distributed cognitive users may transmit, provided they are at a certain protected radius from a primary receiver. We analyze the aggregated interference from the cognitive transmitters to a primary receiver within the PER. Based on this interference and the outage guarantee, we derive bounds on the radius of the PER, showing its interdependence on the receiver protected distance and other system parameters. We also extend the analysis to allowing the cognitive users to scale their power according to the distance from the primary transmitter. These studies provide a closed-form, theoretical analysis of such a network geometry with PER, which may be relevant in the upcoming spectrum sharing actions.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2009.080454","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/5165281/05165294.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2009.080454","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5165281","startPage":"3380","endPage":"3385","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the primary exclusive region of cognitive networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5165294","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"On the primary exclusive region of cognitive networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5165294/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 July 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"8","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 2009","accessionNumber":"10792357","dateOfInsertion":"21 July 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5165294/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the primary exclusive region of cognitive networks","sourcePdf":"3380-tw0907-vu.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.088763S","chronDate":"July  2009","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"5165281","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"130","xplore-issue":"5165281","articleId":"5165294","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5165296,"authors":[{"name":"Jean Pierre Cances","affiliation":["ENSIL, Xlim/C2S2/ESTE UMR CNRS 6172 16, University of Limoges, Limoges, France"],"firstName":"Jean Pierre","lastName":"Cances","id":"37281346000"},{"name":"Vahid Meghdadi","affiliation":["ENSIL, Xlim/C2S2/ESTE UMR CNRS 6172 16, University of Limoges, Limoges, France"],"firstName":"Vahid","lastName":"Meghdadi","id":"37281340800"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1536-1276"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2248"}],"articleNumber":"5165296","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":26,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":363},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/organizations/society/sp/index.html#pub"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5165296","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Design optimization","Parity check codes","Relays","Decoding","Gaussian approximation","Channel capacity","Merging","Fading","Land mobile radio cellular systems","Context"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["approximation theory","Gaussian channels","parity check codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low density parity check codes","half duplex relay channels","LDPC codes","decode strategy","forward strategy","source destination","relay destination transmission","Gaussian approximation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Channel capacity, cooperative diversity, half duplex transmission, low density parity check codes, density evolution."]}],"abstract":"We propose in this paper optimized designs for LDPC codes which are able to work close to the theoretical bounds for the half duplex relay channel using the decode and forward strategy originally proposed by Cover and El Gamal.

Finally, we compare the analytical expression with simulated results for validation.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2009.080938","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/5165281/05165301.pdf","startPage":"3420","endPage":"3424","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2009.080938","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5165281","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bit error performance of convolutional coded MIMO system with linear MMSE receiver","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 July 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5165301/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2009","displayDocTitle":"Bit error performance of convolutional coded MIMO system with linear MMSE receiver","dateOfInsertion":"21 July 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5165301/","accessionNumber":"10792368","volume":"8","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bit error performance of convolutional coded MIMO system with linear MMSE receiver","sourcePdf":"3420-tw0907-kim.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.06028S","chronDate":"July  2009","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"5165281","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"5165281","articleId":"5165301","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5165304,"authors":[{"name":"Mamoun Malkawi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Queen's University, Kingston, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Mamoun","lastName":"Malkawi","id":"37567763400"},{"name":"Il-Min Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Queen's University, Kingston, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Il-Min","lastName":"Kim","id":"37278943200"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1536-1276"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2248"}],"articleNumber":"5165304","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":13,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":192},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/organizations/society/sp/index.html#pub"}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hard/soft detection with limited CSI for multi-hop systems","abstract":"We consider a single-branch, mobile multihop relaying (MMR) network with limited channel state information (CSI) at the destination. The considered CSI signalling strategy reduces the signalling overhead at each relay by at least 50%. We show that this significant overhead reduction comes at the expense of no performance loss at all when hard maximum likelihood detection is carried out at the destination. Furthermore, we consider the use of the MMR system with concatenated channel codes to carry out soft maximum a posteriori (MAP) detection, and demonstrate that with channel codes employed the optimum detection rule becomes prohibitively complex to implement. We propose two approximate soft MAP detection schemes to make the detection feasible for the system, and demonstrate that the performance is either almost identical to or slightly degraded from the

Linear equalization, such as generalized Rake (G-Rake) receivers and transversal chip equalizers, can theoretically provide significant gains in performance by suppressing interference. In this paper, an adaptive G-Rake receiver is developed, employing practical algorithms for finger placement and weight computation. Finger placement is determined by selecting delays from a candidate set using a \"maximal-weight\" criterion. Weight computation includes estimation of an impairment covariance matrix using a parametric approach. While described in the context of the downlink, these algorithms can be used in the uplink as well. Both single-antenna and dual-antenna receivers are considered. Link and system performance are evaluated for the downlink, showing significant gains in high-rate coverage.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2009.060330","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/5165281/05165310.pdf","startPage":"3464","endPage":"3474","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2009.060330","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5165281","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive generalized rake reception in DS-CDMA systems - [transactions papers]","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5165310","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 July 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5165310/","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive generalized rake reception in DS-CDMA systems - [transactions papers]","volume":"8","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 2009","accessionNumber":"10792361","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5165310/","dateOfInsertion":"21 July 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive generalized rake reception in DS-CDMA systems - [transactions papers]","sourcePdf":"3464-tw0907-fulghum.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.102418S","chronDate":"July  2009","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"5165281","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"5165281","articleId":"5165310","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5165312,"authors":[{"name":"David Shui Wing Hui","affiliation":["Department of ECE, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/5165281/5165312/5165312-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["David Shui Wing Hui (S'06) obtained the B.

In practice, users have heterogeneous delay requirements and CSIT usually becomes outdated in time varying channel, which in turns leads to systematic packet errors and hence results in significant degradation on the throughput and delay performance in the OFDMA systems. In this paper, a novel cross-layer design problem is formulated as a convex optimization problem, on which a delay-sensitive jointly optimal power, rate and subcarrier allocation scheme is proposed so as to maintain heterogeneous users' delay requirement as well as achieving a target packet outage probability through combining queueing theory and information theory. Furthermore, we obtain closed-form asymptotic performance of the proposed delay-sensitive scheduler. Unlike the well-known SNR gain of \u0398(log K)in conventional crosslayer scheduler with perfect CSIT, we demonstrate a cross-layer SNR gain of \u0398((1 - \u03c3\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">\u0394H</sub>\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n)log K)can still be achieved under heterogeneous delay constraints and outdated CSIT with error variance \u03c3\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n\u0394H. Finally, simulation results show that our proposed delay-sensitive CSIT error considerate schemes provide robust system performance enhancement over conventional CSIT error inconsiderate opportunistic scheduler and naive queue length based MAX-Weight scheduler while satisfying heterogeneous delay requirements even at moderate to high CSIT errors.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design and Analysis of Delay-Sensitive Cross-Layer OFDMA Systems with Outdated CSIT","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2009.070049","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/5165281/05165312.pdf","startPage":"3484","endPage":"3491","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2009.070049","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5165281","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5165312","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5165312/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 July 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2009","displayDocTitle":"Design and Analysis of Delay-Sensitive Cross-Layer OFDMA Systems with Outdated CSIT","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"8","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/5165312/","dateOfInsertion":"21 July 2009","publicationDate":"July 2009","accessionNumber":"10792371","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design and Analysis of Delay-Sensitive Cross-Layer OFDMA Systems with Outdated CSIT","sourcePdf":"3484-tw0907-hui.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.066354S","chronDate":"July  2009","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"5165281","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"5165281","articleId":"5165312","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5165313,"authors":[{"name":"Shu-Ming Tseng","affiliation":["National Taipei University of Technology, Taipei, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/5165281/5165313/5165313-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Shu-Ming Tseng received the B.S. degree from National Tsing Hua University, Taiwan, and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees from Purdue University, IN, USA, all in electrical engineering, in 1994, 1995, and 1999, respectively.

With universal frequency reuse and DS-CDMA transmission however, the ensuing cross-tier interference causes unacceptable outage probability. This paper develops an uplink capacity analysis and interference avoidance strategy in such a two-tier CDMA network. We evaluate a network-wide area spectral efficiency metric called the operating contour (OC) defined as the feasible combinations of the average number of active macrocell users and femtocell base stations (BS) per cell-site that satisfy a target outage constraint. The capacity analysis provides an accurate characterization of the uplink outage probability, accounting for power control, path loss and shadowing effects. Considering worst case interference at a corner femtocell, results reveal that interference avoidance through a time-hopped CDMA physical layer and sectorized antennas allows about a 7x higher femtocell density, relative to a split spectrum two-tier network with omnidirectional femtocell antennas. A femtocell exclusion region and a tier selection based handoff policy offers modest improvements in the OCs. These results provide guidelines for the design of robust shared spectrum two-tier networks.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 July 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5165314/","volume":"8","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/5165314/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10792376","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 2009","dateOfInsertion":"21 July 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Uplink capacity and interference avoidance for two-tier femtocell networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Uplink capacity and interference avoidance for two-tier femtocell networks","sourcePdf":"3498-tw0907-chandrasekhar.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.084345S","chronDate":"July  2009","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"5165281","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"384","xplore-issue":"5165281","articleId":"5165314","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5165320,"authors":[{"name":"Kyuho Son","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), Daejeon, Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/5165281/5165320/5165320-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Kyuho Son (S'03) received his B.S. and M.S. degrees in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science from Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), Daejeon, Korea, in 2002 and 2004, respectively.

Even in such networks, boundary users would suffer from low throughput due to severe intercell interference and unbalanced user distributions among cells, unless additional schemes to mitigate this problem are employed. In this paper, we tackle this problem by jointly optimizing partial frequency reuse and load-balancing schemes in a multicell network. We formulate this problem as a network-wide utility maximization problem and propose optimal offline and practical online algorithms to solve this. Our online algorithm turns out to be a simple mixture of inter- and intra-cell handover mechanisms for existing users and user association control and cell-site selection mechanisms for newly arriving users. A remarkable feature of the proposed algorithm is that it uses a notion of expected throughput as the decision making metric, as opposed to signal strength in conventional systems. Extensive simulations demonstrate that our online algorithm can not only closely approximate network-wide proportional fairness but also provide two types of gain, interference avoidance gain and load balancing gain, which yield 20~100% throughput improvement of boundary users (depending on traffic load distribution), while not penalizing total system throughput.We also demonstrate that this improvement cannot be achieved by conventional systems using universal frequency reuse and signal strength as the decision making metric.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2009.071140","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/5165281/05165320.pdf","startPage":"3566","endPage":"3576","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2009.071140","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5165281","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamic association for load balancing and interference avoidance in multi-cell networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 July 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5165320/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2009","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic association for load balancing and interference avoidance in multi-cell networks","dateOfInsertion":"21 July 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5165320/","accessionNumber":"10798989","volume":"8","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic association for load balancing and interference avoidance in multi-cell networks","sourcePdf":"3566-tw0907-son.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073692S","chronDate":"July  2009","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"5165281","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"236","xplore-issue":"5165281","articleId":"5165320","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5165322,"authors":[{"name":"Zhendong Luo","affiliation":["China Academy of Telecommunication Research, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/5165281/5165322/5165322-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Zhendong Luo received the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China, in 2006.

However, ToA-based localization systems are very vulnerable to the blockage of the direct path (DP) and occurrence of undetected direct path (UDP) conditions. Erroneous detection of other multipath components as DP, which corresponds to the true distance between transmitter and receiver, introduces substantial ranging and localization error into ToA-based systems. Therefore, in order to enable robust and accurate ToA-based indoor localization, it is important to identify and mitigate occurrence of DP blockage. In this paper we present two methodologies to identify and mitigate the UDP conditions in indoor environments. We first introduce our identification technique which utilizes the statistics of radio propagation channel metrics along with binary hypothesis testing and then we introduce our novel identification technique which integrates the same statistics into a neural network architecture. We analyze each approach and the effects of neural network parameters on the accuracy of the localization system. We also compare the results of the two approaches in a sample indoor environment using both real-time measurement and ray tracing simulation. The identification metrics are extracted from wideband frequency-domain measurements conducted in a typical office building with a system bandwidth of 500 MHz, centered around 1 GHz. Then we show that with the knowledge of the channel condition, it is possible to improve the localization performance by mitigating those UDP-induced ranging errors. Finally, we compare the standard deviation of localization error of traditional localization system and UDP identification-enhanced localization system with their respective lower bound.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5165323/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 July 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"8","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2009","dateOfInsertion":"21 July 2009","accessionNumber":"10792326","htmlLink":"/document/5165323/","displayDocTitle":"UDP identification and error mitigation in toa-based indoor localization systems using neural network architecture","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"UDP identification and error mitigation in toa-based indoor localization systems using neural network architecture","sourcePdf":"3597-tw0907-heidari.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.063834S","chronDate":"July  2009","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"5165281","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"51","xplore-issue":"5165281","articleId":"5165323","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5165327,"authors":[{"name":"Christos Masouros","affiliation":["School of Electrical & Electronic Engineering, University of Manchester, Institute of Science and Technology, Manchester, UK"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/5165281/5165327/5165327-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Christos Masouros (M'06), received his Diploma in Electrical & Computer Engineering from the University of Patras, Greece in 2004 and the MSc by research and PhD degrees in Electrical & Electronic Engineering from the University of Manchester, UK in 2006 and 2009 respectivelly.

The proposed scheme is based on the separation of the instantaneous multiple access interference (MAI) into constructive and destructive components taking into account the dependency on both the channel variation and the instantaneous symbol values of the active users. The first stage of the proposed technique is to adaptively distribute the available spreading sequences to the users on a symbol-by-symbol basis in the form of codehopping with the objective to steer the users' instantaneous crosscorrelations to yield a favourable constructive to destructive MAI ratio. The second stage is to employ a partial transmitter based zero forcing (ZF) scheme specifically designed for the exploitation of constructive MAI. The partial ZF processing decorrelates destructive interferers, while users that interfere constructively remain correlated. This results in a signal to interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) enhancement without the need for additional power-per-user investment. It will be shown in the results section that significant bit error rate (BER) performance benefits can be achieved with this technique.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2009.080740","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/5165281/05165327.pdf","startPage":"3634","endPage":"3645","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2009.080740","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5165281","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Two-stage transmitter precoding based on data-driven code-hopping and partial zero forcing beamforming for MC-CDMA communications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5165327","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 July 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5165327/","displayDocTitle":"Two-stage transmitter precoding based on data-driven code-hopping and partial zero forcing beamforming for MC-CDMA communications","volume":"8","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 2009","accessionNumber":"10792337","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5165327/","dateOfInsertion":"21 July 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Two-stage transmitter precoding based on data-driven code-hopping and partial zero forcing beamforming for MC-CDMA communications","sourcePdf":"3634-tw0907-masouros.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.077937S","chronDate":"July  2009","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"5165281","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"32","xplore-issue":"5165281","articleId":"5165327","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5165328,"authors":[{"name":"Johan Karedal","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Information Technology, Lund University, Lund, Sweden"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/5165281/5165328/5165328-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Johan Karedal received his M.S. degree in engineering physics in 2002 and his Ph.D. in radio communications in 2009, both from Lund University, Sweden.

In this paper, we present a new wideband multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) model for VTV channels based on extensive MIMO channel measurements performed at 5.2 GHz in highway and rural environments in Lund, Sweden. The measured channel characteristics, in particular the nonstationarity of the channel statistics, motivate the use of a geometry-based stochastic channel model (GSCM) instead of the classical tapped-delay line model. We introduce generalizations of the generic GSCM approach and techniques for parameterizing it from measurements and find it suitable to distinguish between diffuse and discrete scattering contributions. The time-variant contribution from discrete scatterers is tracked over time and delay using a high resolution algorithm, and our observations motivate their power being modeled as a combination of a (deterministic) distance decay and a slowly varying stochastic process. The paper gives a full parameterization of the channel model and supplies an implementation recipe for simulations. The model is verified by comparison of MIMO antenna correlations derived from the channel model to those obtained directly from the measurements.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2009.080753","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/5165281/05165328.pdf","startPage":"3646","endPage":"3657","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5165281","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2009.080753","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A geometry-based stochastic MIMO model for vehicle-to-vehicle communications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5165328","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2009","displayDocTitle":"A geometry-based stochastic MIMO model for vehicle-to-vehicle communications","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5165328/","publicationDate":"July 2009","dateOfInsertion":"11 April 2019","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"10792338","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5165328/","volume":"8","issue":"7","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A geometry-based stochastic MIMO model for vehicle-to-vehicle communications","sourcePdf":"3646-tw0907-karedal.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.171008S","chronDate":"July  2009","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"5165281","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"280","xplore-issue":"5165281","articleId":"5165328","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5165329,"authors":[{"name":"Jiwon Kang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Yonsei University, Seoul, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/5165281/5165329/5165329-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jiwon Kang received the B.

THP increases the transmission power due to the use of the modulo operator. In this paper, we propose a method that reduces the transmission power by tilting the constellations of the transmit data symbols. The symbol error rate (SER) is improved for a fixed SNR by reducing the transmission power. Average transmission power is calculated asymptotically by using an extreme value distribution. We have shown that the transmission power can be significantly reduced when we use the tilted constellation THP. As the transmission power determines the SER slope, at high SNRs we achieve lower SER than in the case of a transmission over an AWGN channel. The tilted angle can be estimated at the receiver. An angle estimation algorithm is proposed that optimizes angle estimation error and SER.We use the approximation of the angle estimation error and SER to find an optimum number of tilted angles. By using the proposed angle estimation algorithm and the optimum number of tilted angles, the tilted constellation THP always outperforms the conventional THP algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2009.080778","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/5165281/05165329.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2009.080778","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5165281","startPage":"3658","endPage":"3667","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Tomlinson-harashima precoder with tilted constellation for reducing transmission power","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5165329","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Tomlinson-harashima precoder with tilted constellation for reducing transmission power","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5165329/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 July 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"8","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 2009","accessionNumber":"10792353","dateOfInsertion":"21 July 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5165329/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Tomlinson-harashima precoder with tilted constellation for reducing transmission power","sourcePdf":"3658-tw0907-kang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.06696S","chronDate":"July  2009","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"5165281","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"5165281","articleId":"5165329","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5165332,"authors":[{"name":"Jeyadeepan Jeganathan","affiliation":["Ericsson, Montreal, Canada","ECE Department, Concordia University, Montreal, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/5165281/5165332/5165332-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jeyadeepan Jeganathan received the B.Eng.

Fading is exploited for multiple-input multiple-output(MIMO) channels to provide better performance over conventional amplitude/phase modulation (APM) techniques. In SSK, it is the antenna index used during transmission that relays information, rather than the transmitted symbols themselves. This absence of symbol information eliminates the transceiver elements necessary for APM transmission and detection (such as coherent detectors). As well, the simplicity involved in modulation reduces the detection complexity compared to that of SM, while achieving almost identical performance gains. Throughout the paper, we illustrate SSK's strength by studying its interaction with the fading channel. We obtain tight upper bounds on bit error probability, and discuss SSK's performance under some non-ideal channel conditions (estimation error and spatial correlation). Analytical and simulation results show performance gains over APM systems (3 dB at a bit error rate of 10\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">-5</sup>\n), making SSK an interesting candidate for future wireless applications. We then extend SSK concepts to incorporate channel coding, where in particular, we consider a bit interleaved coded modulation (BICM) system using iterative decoding for both convolutional and turbo codes. Capacity results are derived, and improvements over APM are illustrated (up to 1 bits/s/Hz), with performance gains of up to 5 dB.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2009.080910","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5165281","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2009.080910","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/5165281/05165332.pdf","startPage":"3692","endPage":"3703","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Space shift keying modulation for MIMO channels","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 July 2009","displayDocTitle":"Space shift keying modulation for MIMO channels","volume":"8","issue":"7","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2009","dateOfInsertion":"21 July 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5165332/","publicationDate":"July 2009","accessionNumber":"10792340","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5165332/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Space shift keying modulation for MIMO channels","sourcePdf":"3692-tw0907-jeganathan.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.151589S","chronDate":"July  2009","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"5165281","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"664","xplore-issue":"5165281","articleId":"5165332","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5165333,"authors":[{"name":"Symeon Chatzinotas","affiliation":["Centre for Communication Systems Research, University of Surrey, UK"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/5165281/5165333/5165333-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Symeon Chatzinotas (S'06) received the B.Eng. in Telecommunications from Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Greece and the M.Sc. and Ph.D. in Electronic Engineering from University of Surrey, UK in 2003, 2006 and 2009 respectively.

Moreover, it has been proved that the multiplexing sum-rate capacity gain of multicell processing systems is proportional to the number of base station (BS) antennas. These results have been also established for cellular systems, where BSs and user terminals (UTs) are equipped with multiple antennas. Nevertheless, a common simplifying assumption in the literature is the uncorrelated nature of the Rayleigh fading coefficients within the BSUT MIMO links. In this direction, this paper investigates the ergodic multicell-processing sum-rate capacity of the Gaussian MIMO cellular multiple-access channel in a correlated fading environment. More specifically, the multiple antennas of both BSs and UTs are assumed to be correlated according to the Kronecker product model. Furthermore, the current system model considers Rayleigh fading, uniformly distributed UTs over a planar coverage area and power-law path loss. Based on free probabilistic arguments, the empirical eigenvalue distribution of the channel covariance matrix is derived and it is used to calculate both optimal joint decoding and minimum mean square error (MMSE) filtering capacity. In addition, numerical results are presented, where the per-cell sum-rate capacity is evaluated while varying the cell density of the system, as well as the level of fading correlation. In this context, it is shown that the capacity performance is greatly compromised by BS-side correlation, whereas UT-side correlation has a negligible effect on the system's performance. Furthermore, MMSE performance is shown to be greatly suboptimal but more resilient to fading correlation in comparison to optimal decoding.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2009.080922","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/5165281/05165333.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2009.080922","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5165281","startPage":"3704","endPage":"3715","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the multicell processing capacity of the cellular MIMO uplink channel in correlated rayleigh fading environment","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5165333","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"On the multicell processing capacity of the cellular MIMO uplink channel in correlated rayleigh fading environment","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5165333/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 July 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"8","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 2009","accessionNumber":"10792355","dateOfInsertion":"21 July 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5165333/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the multicell processing capacity of the cellular MIMO uplink channel in correlated rayleigh fading environment","sourcePdf":"3704-tw0907-chatzinotas.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.132008S","chronDate":"July  2009","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"5165281","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"71","xplore-issue":"5165281","articleId":"5165333","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5165334,"authors":[{"name":"Kuei-Chiang Lai","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/5165281/5165334/5165334-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Kuei-Chiang Lai received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan, R.O.C., in 1993 and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical and computer engineering from the University of California, Santa Barbara, in 1997 and 2001, respectively.

Second, upper bound and approximation of the average symbol error rate (SER) for pulse amplitude modulation (PAM), quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM), and phase shift keying (PSK) with M-ary signaling are evaluated by using the MGF of the SINR.

An appropriate limit for rates achievable under delay constraints is the delay limited capacity (DLC). In this work, the DLC of OFDM systems is investigated. Despite its complicated correlation structure the OFDM DLC is fully characterized for low and high SNR. It is shown that (under weak assumptions) the OFDM DLC is almost independent of the fading distribution in the low SNR region but strongly depends on the delay spread thereby achieving a capacity gain over AWGN capacity. In the high SNR region the roles are exchanged. Here, the impact of delay spread is negligible while the impact of the fading distribution becomes dominant. The relevant quantities and their asymptotic behaviour are derived without employing simplifying assumptions on the OFDM correlation structure. Using a general convergence framework the analysis further shows that if the delay spread becomes large even the predominant impact of the fading distribution vanishes and DLC capacity loss compared to AWGN capacity approaches 0.58[nats/s/Hz]. The convergence speed, the loss due to non-uniform power delay profile, and the relation to ergodic capacity is also analyzed and underlined with simulations and application examples. The main conclusion here is that OFDM fully takes advantage of the degrees of freedom of the underlying fading channel in terms of delay spread and, regardless of the fading distribution, delay sensitive capacity measures such as the DLC converge to the ergodic capacity. Finally, since universal bounds are obtained which apply to any fading distribution the results can also be used for other classes of parallel channels extending the range of applicability.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2009.080991","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/5165281/05165337.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2009.080991","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5165281","startPage":"3747","endPage":"3757","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Delay-limited transmission in OFDM systems: performance bounds and impact of system parameters","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5165337","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Delay-limited transmission in OFDM systems: performance bounds and impact of system parameters","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5165337/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 July 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"8","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 2009","accessionNumber":"10792322","dateOfInsertion":"21 July 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5165337/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Delay-limited transmission in OFDM systems: performance bounds and impact of system parameters","sourcePdf":"3747-tw0907-wunder.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.082196S","chronDate":"July  2009","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"5165281","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5165281","articleId":"5165337","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":5165338,"authors":[{"name":"Pengfei Sun","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University of Leeds, Leeds, UK"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/5165281/5165338/5165338-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Pengfei Sun received his B.Sc. degree in electronic engineering from Beijing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Beijing, China in 2005, the M.Sc degree from University of Leeds, Leeds, UK in 2006.

This problem is investigated in this paper, and we propose a novel low complexity pilot aided frequency synchronization algorithm based on two consecutive OFDMA blocks, which are assigned with identical tile structure and pilot symbols. The pilot symbols can be used for both the CFO estimation and the channel estimation and hence effectively increases the spectral efficiency, since no additional pilot symbols or training sequence are needed exclusively for the CFO estimation. However, the solution to this multi-parameter estimation problem is prohibitively complex since it demands a multi-dimensional search. To solve this problem, we propose an iterative joint CFO estimation and compensation algorithm, which reduces the multi-dimensional search to only one simple one-dimensional search. In addition, the proposed scheme allows the CFO estimation and compensation to operate without the channel information and thereby further reduces the computational complexity. We analyze the identifiability in the CFO estimation and derive the analytical mean square error (MSE) of the CFO estimates to serve as the performance benchmark. The simulation results show that the synchronization algorithm achieves fast convergence in two iterations, and the accuracy of the CFO estimates matches the benchmark performance closely at moderate and high SNRs and outperforms an existing similar algorithm proposed in the literature.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low complexity pilot aided frequency synchronization for OFDMA uplink transmission","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2009.081005","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/5165281/05165338.pdf","startPage":"3758","endPage":"3769","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2009.081005","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5165281","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5165338","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5165338/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 July 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2009","displayDocTitle":"Low complexity pilot aided frequency synchronization for OFDMA uplink transmission","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"8","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/5165338/","dateOfInsertion":"21 July 2009","publicationDate":"July 2009","accessionNumber":"10792351","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low complexity pilot aided frequency synchronization for OFDMA uplink transmission","sourcePdf":"3758-tw0907-sun.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.066594S","chronDate":"July  2009","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"5165281","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"55","xplore-issue":"5165281","articleId":"5165338","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5165339,"authors":[{"name":"Maggie Cheng","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Missouri University of Science and Technology, Rolla, MO, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/5165281/5165339/5165339-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Maggie Cheng is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science at Missouri University of Science and Technology.

In the past, many energy efficient routing algorithms have been devised in order to maximize network lifetime, in which wireless link bandwidth has been optimistically assumed to be sufficient. This article shows that ignoring the bandwidth constraint can lead to infeasible routing solutions. As energy constraint affects how data should be routed, link bandwidth also affects not only the routing topology but also the allowed data rate on each link. In this paper, we discuss the sufficient condition on link bandwidth that makes a routing solution feasible, then provide mathematical optimization models to tackle both energy and bandwidth constraints.We first present a basic mathematical model to address using uniform transmission power for routing without data aggregation, then extend it to handle nonuniform transmission power, and then routing with data aggregation. We propose two efficient heuristics to compute the routing topology and link data rate. Simulation results show that these heuristics provide more feasible routing solutions than previous work, and provide significant improvement on throughput and lifetime.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2009.081134","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/5165281/05165339.pdf","startPage":"3770","endPage":"3779","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2009.081134","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5165281","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint routing and link rate allocation under bandwidth and energy constraints in sensor networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 July 2009","displayDocTitle":"Joint routing and link rate allocation under bandwidth and energy constraints in sensor networks","volume":"8","issue":"7","dateOfInsertion":"21 July 2009","accessionNumber":"10792367","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5165339/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5165339/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint routing and link rate allocation under bandwidth and energy constraints in sensor networks","sourcePdf":"3770-tw0907-cheng.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.056568S","chronDate":"July  2009","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"5165281","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"48","xplore-issue":"5165281","articleId":"5165339","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5165341,"authors":[{"name":"Tae-Won Yune","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Electrical Engineering, Pohang University of Science and Technology, Pohang, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/5165281/5165341/5165341-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Tae-Won Yune received the B.S. degree in electronic and electrical engineering from Hanyang University, Seoul, Korea, in 2004.

The extrinsic information transfer (EXIT) charts and bit-error rate (BER) plots are presented to investigate the iterative behavior of the IMD-FDE over additive white Gaussian noise and multipath fading channels. In a conventional time-division multiple-access (TDMA)-based relay protocol, cooperative transmission over two time slots leads to a 50% loss in spectral efficiency. We propose two spectral efficient relay protocols, where multiple sources access a relay, destination, or both simultaneously. We also present a new iterative detection scheme that effectively removes multiuser interferences for the proposed relay protocols.With the proposed protocols and the aid of iterative multiuser detection scheme, the proposed relay-assisted SC-FDMA with IMD-FDE can obtain diversity gain without sacrificing spectral efficiency and approaches the single-user bound over time-varying and frequency-selective fading relay channels.","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/5165281/05165341.pdf","startPage":"3789","endPage":"3797","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5165281","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2009.081246","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2009.081246","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5165341","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiuser detection","Relays","Access protocols","Iterative methods","Interference","Bit error rate","Fading","Frequency conversion","Transmitters","Frequency domain analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fading channels","frequency division multiple access","iterative methods","multiuser detection","protocols","radio receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["iterative multiuser detection","relaying protocols","single-carrier transmission","frequency-domain equalization","single carrier frequency division multiple access framework","multiuser interference","extrinsic information transfer","bit-error rate","time-division multiple-access-based relay protocol","cooperative transmission","fading relay channels"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Single carrier frequency division multiple access (SC-FDMA), multiuser detection, iterative detection, relay."]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5165341/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 July 2009","displayDocTitle":"Iterative multiuser detection with spectral efficient relaying protocols for single-carrier transmission","accessionNumber":"10792379","dateOfInsertion":"21 July 2009","publicationDate":"July 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5165341/","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"8","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Iterative multiuser detection with spectral efficient relaying protocols for single-carrier transmission","sourcePdf":"3789-tw0907-yune.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.095762S","chronDate":"July  2009","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"5165281","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"5165281","articleId":"5165341","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":5165343,"authors":[{"name":"Fr\u00e9d\u00e9rique Oggier","affiliation":["Division of Mathematical Sciences, School of Physical and Mathematical Sciences, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/5165281/5165343/5165343-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Fr\u00e9d\u00e9rique Oggier received her degree (Dipl\u00f4me) in Mathematics and Computer Science in 2000 from the University of Geneva, CH.

Specifically, each cluster forms one or multiple local messages via sensor collaboration (in particular, linear operation is considered) and transmits the messages over noisy channels to a fusion center (FC). The final estimate is constructed at the FC based on the noisy data received from all clusters. In this collaborative setup, we study the following fundamental problems. Given a total transmit power constraint, shall we transmit the raw data or some low-dimensional local messages for each cluster? What is the optimal collaboration scheme for each cluster? How to optimally allocate the power among different clusters? These questions are addressed in this paper. We will show that the optimum collaboration strategy is to compress the data into one local message which, depending on the channel characteristics, is transmitted using one or multiple available channels to the FC. The optimal power allocation among the clusters is also investigated, which yields a water- filling type of scheme.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Power constrained distributed estimation with cluster-based sensor collaboration","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2009.081438","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/5165281/05165345.pdf","startPage":"3822","endPage":"3832","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2009.081438","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5165281","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5165345","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5165345/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 July 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2009","displayDocTitle":"Power constrained distributed estimation with cluster-based sensor collaboration","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"8","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/5165345/","dateOfInsertion":"21 July 2009","publicationDate":"July 2009","accessionNumber":"10792342","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power constrained distributed estimation with cluster-based sensor collaboration","sourcePdf":"3822-tw0907-fang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.071894S","chronDate":"July  2009","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"5165281","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"43","xplore-issue":"5165281","articleId":"5165345","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":5165346,"authors":[{"name":"S.

In these networks users are free to choose their power control strategy to selfishly maximize their energy-efficiency. Specifically, we introduce hierarchy in two different ways: 1. Assuming single-user decoding at the receiver, we investigate a Stackelberg formulation of the game where one user is the leader whereas the other users are assumed to be able to react to the leader's decisions; 2. Assuming neither leader nor followers among the users, we introduce hierarchy by assuming successive interference cancellation at the receiver. It is shown that introducing a certain degree of hierarchy in non-cooperative power control games not only improves the individual energy efficiency of all the users but can also be a way of insuring the existence of a non-saturated equilibrium and reaching a desired trade-off between the global network performance at the equilibrium and the requested amount of signaling. In this respect, the way of measuring the global performance of an energy-efficient network is shown to be a critical issue.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/5165281/05165346.pdf","startPage":"3833","endPage":"3843","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2009.081443","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2009.081443","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5165281","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5165346","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Introducing hierarchy in energy games","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Energy efficiency","Power control","Game theory","Decoding","Nash equilibrium","Receivers","Fading","Multiaccess communication","Temperature sensors","Pricing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decoding","interference suppression","radio receivers","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy game hierarchy","wireless networks","decentralized multiple access channel","single user decoding","radio receiver","Stackelberg formulation","interference cancellation","noncooperative power control games"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cognitive radio, energy-efficiency, Nash equilibrium, power control games, Stackelberg equilibrium.

Conventional direct transmission (DTX) scheme results in high aggregate transmit power and uneven power distribution. In this paper, we consider location-aware cooperation-based schemes namely immediate-neighbor cooperation (INC), maximal cooperation (MAX), and wireless network cocast (WNC) that achieve spatial diversity to reduce aggregate transmit power and even power distribution. INC utilizes twouser cooperative communication, resulting in good reduction of aggregate transmit power and low transmission delay; however, power distribution is still uneven. MAX utilizes multi-node cooperative communication, providing incremental diversity to achieve even power distribution and substantial reduction in aggregate transmit power. Transmission delay in MAX, however, grows quadratically with network sizes. As a result, the novel WNC is proposed to achieve incremental diversity as in MAX and low transmission delay as in INC. In WNC, mobile units acting as relays form unique linearly-coded signals from overheard signals and transmit them to the destination, where a multiuser detector jointly detects the symbols from all received signals. Performance evaluation in uniformly distributed networks shows that INC, MAX, and WNC substantially reduce aggregate transmit power while MAX and WNC also provide even power distribution.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2009.081456","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/5165281/05165347.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5165281","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2009.081456","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","startPage":"3844","endPage":"3854","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Wireless network cocast: location-aware cooperative communications with linear network coding","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5165347","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 July 2009","displayDocTitle":"Wireless network cocast: location-aware cooperative communications with linear network coding","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5165347/","volume":"8","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/5165347/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2009","accessionNumber":"10792382","dateOfInsertion":"21 July 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wireless network cocast: location-aware cooperative communications with linear network coding","sourcePdf":"3844-tw0907-lai.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.074551S","chronDate":"July  2009","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"5165281","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"5165281","articleId":"5165347","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5165348,"authors":[{"name":"Minchul Ju","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Queen's University, Kingston, ONT, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/5165281/5165348/5165348-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["MinChul Ju received the B.S. degree in Electrical Engineering from Pohang University of Science and Technology, Pohang, Korea, in 1997 and the M.S. degree in Electrical Engineering from Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), Taejon, Korea, in 1999.

In this system, due to a symbol error at the relay, the ML receiver at the destination needs to consider all the possible symbol detection scenarios at the relay as well as at the destination. Therefore, the ML detection metric is given by a linear combination of exponential functions, which prevents the use of the classical minimum Euclidean distance rule. Adopting the max-log approximation, we approximate the ML detection rule which makes the ML performance analysis tractable. In order to facilitate the derivation of decision regions, we simplify the ML detection rule in the two-dimensional real space such that two metric values of two adjacent constellation points are sequentially compared. Then we obtain decision regions in a form without union and intersection. Finally, based on the decision regions, we derive a very accurate closedform BER approximation for M-pulse amplitude modulation (PAM) and M-quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM). The obtained BER expression can serve as the error performance upper-bound of the decode-and-forward protocol in cooperative diversity networks.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2009.081470","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/5165281/05165348.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2009.081470","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5165281","startPage":"3855","endPage":"3867","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"ML performance analysis of the decode-and-forward protocol in cooperative diversity networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5165348","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"ML performance analysis of the decode-and-forward protocol in cooperative diversity networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5165348/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"8","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 2009","accessionNumber":"10792381","dateOfInsertion":"11 April 2019","htmlLink":"/document/5165348/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"ML performance analysis of the decode-and-forward protocol in cooperative diversity networks","sourcePdf":"3855-tw0907-ju.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.085343S","chronDate":"July  2009","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"5165281","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"50","xplore-issue":"5165281","articleId":"5165348","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5165375,"authors":[{"name":"Enver Cavus","affiliation":["Broadcom Corporation, Irvine, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Enver","lastName":"Cavus","id":"37573373000"},{"name":"Charles L.

Based on the derived formulas, the performance of triple-branch generalized selection combining (GSC) receivers is analyzed. For this type of receivers, the outage and the average bit error probability for a variety of modulation schemes are analytically obtained.

Unlike previous works that assume perfect knowledge of the average channel signal-to-noise ratio, this paper considers the realistic case where estimation of the average channel signal-to-noise ratio has error. Furthermore, while previous works have designed and examined estimators based on assuming that the channel samples used in the average signal-to-noise ratio estimators are noiseless, the present work assumes that the channel samples are noisy, as is the case in practical systems. Numerical results show that the probability of missed opportunity decreases as the estimation error decreases, as expected. Perhaps unexpectedly, the results also show that in the presence of noise, there exists a threshold phenomenon for the noise level. Below a particular threshold, the probability of missed opportunity increases as the noise level increases. Yet above this threshold, the probability of missed opportunity decreases as the noise level increases.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2009.07.070166","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5165372","startPage":"1944","endPage":"1947","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/5165372/05165387.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance of collaborative spectrum sensing for cognitive radio in the presence of gaussian channel estimation errors","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5165387/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 July 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5165387/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Performance of collaborative spectrum sensing for cognitive radio in the presence of gaussian channel estimation errors","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2009","accessionNumber":"10781192","dateOfInsertion":"17 July 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"57","issue":"7","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance of collaborative spectrum sensing for cognitive radio in the presence of gaussian channel estimation errors","sourcePdf":"1944-tc0907-chen.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038073S","chronDate":"July  2009","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"5165372","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"5165372","articleId":"5165387","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5165388,"authors":[{"name":"Ioannis Chatzigeorgiou","affiliation":["Computer Laboratory, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/5165372/5165388/5165388-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ioannis Chatzigeorgiou (S'99-M'05) was born in Volos, Greece, in 1974.

In this paper, we propose a technique for the calculation of the transfer function of convolutional block codes, both punctured and nonpunctured. The novelty of our approach lies in the augmentation of the conventional state diagram, which allows the enumeration of all codeword sequences of a convolutional block code. In the case of a turbo code, we can readily calculate an upper bound to its bit error rate performance if the transfer function of each constituent convolutional block code has been obtained. The bound gives an accurate estimate of the error floor of the turbo code and, consequently, our method provides a useful analytical tool for determining constituent codes or identifying puncturing patterns that improve the bit error rate performance of a turbo code, at high signal-to-noise ratios.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2009.07.070344","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/5165372/05165388.pdf","startPage":"1948","endPage":"1958","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2009.07.070344","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5165372","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The augmented state diagram and its application to convolutional and turbo codes","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 July 2009","displayDocTitle":"The augmented state diagram and its application to convolutional and turbo codes","volume":"57","issue":"7","dateOfInsertion":"17 July 2009","accessionNumber":"10781193","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5165388/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5165388/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The augmented state diagram and its application to convolutional and turbo codes","sourcePdf":"1948-tc0907-chatzigeorgiou.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.081716S","chronDate":"July  2009","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"5165372","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"5165372","articleId":"5165388","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5165390,"authors":[{"name":"Ali Sanaei","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/5165372/5165390/5165390-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ali Sanaei received the B.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from Isfahan University of Technology, Isfahan, Iran, in 2003 and the M.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from the University of Alberta in 2008, where he was a student member of the $i$CORE Wireless Communications Laboratory ($i$ WCL), Edmonton, Canada."]},"firstName":"Ali","lastName":"Sanaei","id":"37573351300"},{"name":"Mahdi Ramezani","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/5165372/5165390/5165390-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Mahdi Ramezani received the B.Sc. degree in Electrical Engineering from the Iran University of Science and Technology in 2006.

Such codes are referred to as universal LDPC codes. First, based on numerous observations, a conjecture is put forth that a code working on \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">N</i>\n equal-capacity channels, also works on any convex combination of these \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">N</i>\n channels.

Such codes are found over a wide range of rates. An upper bound on the achievable rate of universal LDPC codes is suggested. Through examples, it is shown that our codes achieve rates extremely close to this upper bound.

This decoder, based on the idea first developed by Reed in a 1959 MIT Lincoln Laboratory Report, uses real channel data to estimate the individual bit-error probabilities in a received word. The algorithm then sequentially inverts the bits with the highest probability of error until one of the errors is canceled. The remaining errors are then corrected by the use of algebraic decoding techniques. This new algorithm, called the reliability-search algorithm, is a complete decoder that significantly reduces the decoding complexity in terms of CPU time while maintaining the same bit-error rate (BER) performance. In fact, this algorithm is an appropriate modification to the algorithm developed by Chase.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5165393/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 July 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2009","volume":"57","issue":"7","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10781197","dateOfInsertion":"17 July 2009","publicationDate":"July 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5165393/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Decoding the (47,24,11) quadratic residue code using bit-error probability estimates","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Decoding the (47,24,11) quadratic residue code using bit-error probability estimates","sourcePdf":"1986-tc0907-dubney.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.090821S","chronDate":"July  2009","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"5165372","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"5165372","articleId":"5165393","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-28"},{"_id":5165394,"authors":[{"name":"Sang Hyun Lee","affiliation":["Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute, Daejeon, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/5165372/5165394/5165394-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Sang Hyun Lee received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electrical engineering from the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), Daejeon, Korea, in 1999 and 2001.

Combining frequency domain equalization and bit-interleaved coded modulation (BICM), the iterative receiver is able to harvest both temporal and frequency diversity. Realizing that ICI channels are intrinsically ISI channels, this paper proposes a soft-in soft-out (SISO) maximum a posteriori (MAP) equalizer by extending Ungerboeck's maximum likelihood sequence estimator (MLSE) formulation to ICI channels. The SISO MAP equalizer employs BCJR algorithm and computes the bit log-likelihood ratios (LLR) for the entire received sequence by efficiently constructing a trellis that takes into account of the ICI channel structure. A reduced state (RS) formulation of the SISO MAP equalizer which provides good performance/complexity tradeoff is also described. Utilizing the fact that ICI energy is clustered in adjacent subcarriers, frequency domain equalization is made localized. This paper further proposes two computational efficient linear minimum mean square error (LMMSE) based equalization methods: recursive q-tap SIC-LMMSE equalizer and recursive Sliding-Window (SW) SIC-LMMSE equalizer respectively.

Convolutional codes are used to provide error protection to a particular user in an Asynchronous CDMA (A- CDMA) system undergoing slow Rician fading. Maximum likelihood decoding with a Viterbi algorithm recovers the information symbols. A Phase Locked Loop (PLL) depicting the variations in the phase error for abrupt phase changes in the input signal is considered. Analytical bounds, which are useful in predicting the performance of the A-CDMA system are derived and plotted for the cases of infinite and finite channel memory. The upper bounds on the unconditional Bit Error Rate (BER) with Viterbi decoding are derived and plotted for the various convolutional codes considered. The simulated BERs are found to agree well with their upper bounds.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2009.07.070553","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/5165372/05165400.pdf","startPage":"2052","endPage":"2059","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2009.07.070553","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5165372","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance of convolutional codes in asynchronous CDMA communications under imperfect phase-tracking conditions","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5165400","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 July 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5165400/","displayDocTitle":"Performance of convolutional codes in asynchronous CDMA communications under imperfect phase-tracking conditions","volume":"57","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 2009","accessionNumber":"10781203","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5165400/","dateOfInsertion":"17 July 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance of convolutional codes in asynchronous CDMA communications under imperfect phase-tracking conditions","sourcePdf":"2052-tc0907-bhaskar.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.080116S","chronDate":"July  2009","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"5165372","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5165372","articleId":"5165400","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":5165401,"authors":[{"name":"Juan I.

In addition, often a cyclic prefix (CP) longer than the channel delay spread is assumed, and thus the impact of the possible inter-symbol interference (ISI) from adjacent OFDM symbols is not a consideration. This work provides a consolidated framework for study and analysis of OFDM systems with imperfections. The imperfections include time and frequency synchronization errors, and channel delay spread beyond the CP duration. Transmit as well as receive filtering operations are explicitly modeled, and different receiver detection criteria are considered. The use of an OFDM waveform for UWB applications is known to be a promising choice to simplify the receiver design and to maximize the bandwidth scalability, as well as the adaptation to various spectrum allocations. We present bit error rate (BER) sensitivity analysis to key system parameters for OFDM-based UWB applications. From these sensitivity analyses, we see graceful performance degradation with decreasing CP length and increasing residual frequency error. The performance degradation can be much more critical for timing synchronization errors.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2009.07.070452","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/5165372/05165401.pdf","startPage":"2060","endPage":"2070","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2009.07.070452","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5165372","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Effects of imperfections on the performance of OFDM systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 July 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5165401/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2009","displayDocTitle":"Effects of imperfections on the performance of OFDM systems","dateOfInsertion":"17 July 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5165401/","accessionNumber":"10781204","volume":"57","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Effects of imperfections on the performance of OFDM systems","sourcePdf":"2060-tc0907-montojo.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.078294S","chronDate":"July  2009","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"5165372","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"5165372","articleId":"5165401","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5165402,"authors":[{"name":"Alex Alvarado","affiliation":["Department of Signals and Systems, Communication Systems Group, Chalmers University of Technology, Gothenburg, Sweden"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/5165372/5165402/5165402-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Alex Alvarado (S'06) was born in 1982 in Quell\u00f3n, Chilo\u00e9 Island, Chile.

Leveraging the special properties of Alamouti matrices, we first show that spatial multiplexing of Alamouti signals retains the space-time diversity gain of Alamouti signaling using our proposed low-complexity Alamouti BLAST-MMSE (A-BLAST) Algorithm. Next, in contrast to traditional transmit diversity that focuses on STBC construction at the transmitter, this paper looks at transmit diversity from the perspective of the receiver. In other words, the receiver gets to choose the STBCiquests, which are favourable to the channel assuming a fixed BLAST receive algorithm. In a multiuserMAC setting, we first present a systematic methodology to exploit different decomposition structure in Alamouti matrices, each with different tradeoff between performance and decoding complexity using possibly different MIMO receive algorithms. We then demonstrate that the notion of angles (the inner product of two quaternionic vectors) between multiuser channels determines the performance of MIMO receive algorithms. As an application of the general theory, we transform the decoding problem for several types of Quasi-Orthogonal STBC (QOSTBC) into multiuser detection of virtual Alamouti users. Building upon our A-BLAST Algorithm, we propose new algorithms for decoding single-user and multiuser QOSTBC. In particular, we show that bit error probability is a function of the quaternionic angle between virtual users (for a single user) or multiple users. This angle varies with the type of QOSTBC and leads to a new form of adaptive modulation called code diversity, where feedback instructs the transmitter how to choose from a plurality of codes.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2009.07.070592","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/5165372/05165403.pdf","startPage":"2080","endPage":"2089","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2009.07.070592","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5165372","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiuser detection of alamouti signals","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5165403","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 July 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5165403/","displayDocTitle":"Multiuser detection of alamouti signals","volume":"57","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 2009","accessionNumber":"10781206","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5165403/","dateOfInsertion":"17 July 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiuser detection of alamouti signals","sourcePdf":"2080-tc0907-tan.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.115883S","chronDate":"July  2009","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"5165372","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"40","xplore-issue":"5165372","articleId":"5165403","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5165404,"authors":[{"name":"Bogdan Cristea","affiliation":["Sytron Technologies Overseas, Bucharest, Romania"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/5165372/5165404/5165404-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Bogdan Cristea received the Engineer Degree in Telecommunications from Military Technical Academy of Bucharest, Romania in 2001.

The stability property of a scheduling policy is characterized by the stability region, which is the largest region on arrival rates for which the queueing system can be stabilized by the scheduling policy. It is shown in this paper that under very loose conditions, the max-delay-utility scheduling has the maximum stability region. In environments with insufficient scattering or strong line-of-sight components, delay transmit diversity can increase the fluctuation in the frequency domain to improve the performance. The simulation results show that the max-delay-utility scheduling with a frugality constraint is highly advantageous to data transmission with a low latency requirement over shared multiple channels, and that joint scheduling and power allocation can substantially boost the performance.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2009.07.070394","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/5165372/05165406.pdf","startPage":"2109","endPage":"2121","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2009.07.070394","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5165372","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint channel- and queue-aware scheduling for multiuser diversity in wireless OFDMA networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5165406","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 July 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5165406/","displayDocTitle":"Joint channel- and queue-aware scheduling for multiuser diversity in wireless OFDMA networks","volume":"57","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 2009","accessionNumber":"10781209","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5165406/","dateOfInsertion":"17 July 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint channel- and queue-aware scheduling for multiuser diversity in wireless OFDMA networks","sourcePdf":"2109-tc0907-song.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.076474S","chronDate":"July  2009","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"5165372","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"55","xplore-issue":"5165372","articleId":"5165406","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5165407,"authors":[{"name":"Marco Di Renzo","affiliation":["Institute for Digital Communications (IDCOM), School of Engineering, College of Science and Engineering, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/5165372/5165407/5165407-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Marco Di Renzo (S'05-AM'07) was born in L'Aquila, Italy, in 1978.

However, finding the best sign not only requires a search over 2\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">n</sup>\n possible signs but also may lead to a substantial rate loss for small size constellations. In this paper, we first propose a greedy algorithm to choose the signs based on p-norm minimization and prove that the resulting PMEPR is guaranteed to be less than c log n where c is a constant independent of n for any n. This approach has lower complexity in each iteration compared to the derandomization approach of while achieving similar PMEPR reduction. We further improve the performance of the proposed algorithm by enlarging the search space using pruning. Simulation results show that PMEPR of a multicarrier signal with 128 subcarriers can be reduced to within 1.6 dB of the PMEPR of a single carrier system. In the second part of the paper, we address the rate loss by proposing a block coding scheme in which only one sign vector is chosen for K different modulating vectors. The sign vector can be computed using the greedy algorithm in n iterations. We show that the multi-symbol encoding approach can reduce the rate loss by a factor of K while achieving the PMEPR of c logKn, i.e., only logarithmic growth in K. Simulation results show that the rate loss can be made smaller than %10 at the cost of only 1 db increase in the resulting PMEPR for a system with 128 subcarriers.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2009.07.080012","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/5165372/05165410.pdf","startPage":"2160","endPage":"2166","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2009.07.080012","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5165372","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Peak power reduction of OFDM signals with sign adjustment","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5165410","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 July 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5165410/","displayDocTitle":"Peak power reduction of OFDM signals with sign adjustment","volume":"57","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 2009","accessionNumber":"10781213","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5165410/","dateOfInsertion":"17 July 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Peak power reduction of OFDM signals with sign adjustment","sourcePdf":"2160-tc0907-sharif.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.244071S","chronDate":"July  2009","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"5165372","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"5165372","articleId":"5165410","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5165541,"authors":[{"name":"Henry E.

Although the ADI-FDTD iteration comprises two substeps, which each require solving a tridiagonal matrix system of equations over xy, xz, yz planes of the domain, the application of this scheme frees the time-step size from the Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy stability constraint. In our implementation we took advantage of the fine-grain thread parallelism and coarse-grained block parallelism of the GPU architecture, allowing us to use the parallel cyclic reduction method to simultaneously solve many tridiagonal systems of equations.

Yet, a survey of the relevant FDTD literature indicates a number of contradictory results, which stem from inherent limitations of the method. This paper is focused on the impact of numerical dispersion on the FDTD study of the ldquoperfect lensrdquo. It is shown that the calculated resolution of such a lens is primarily related to the FDTD cell size rather than the medium itself, due to the sensitivity of the numerical attenuation constant of evanescent waves. While the introduction of material losses improves the convergence of such simulations, it deteriorates their accuracy. Specific conditions are stated for achieving certain accuracy levels with standard FDTD and high-order finite differences.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE MTT-S International Microwave Symposium Digest","pdfPath":"/iel5/5159259/5165586/05165680.pdf","startPage":"249","endPage":"252","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE MTT-S International Microwave Symposium Digest","doi":"10.1109/MWSYM.2009.5165680","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWSYM.2009.5165680","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5165586","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5165680","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Effects of numerical dispersion on the accuracy of FDTD modeling of propagating and evanescent waves in negative index media","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Dispersion","Finite difference methods","Time domain analysis","Lenses","Optical materials","Convergence","Slabs","Magnetic analysis","Strontium","Physics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dispersion (wave)","electromagnetic wave propagation","finite difference time-domain analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discrete space-time method","numerical dispersion","FDTD modeling","finite difference time domain analysis","negative index media","perfect lens study","numerical attenuation constant","evanescent wave propagation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Finite-diffference Time-Domain","numerical dispersion","negative index media"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5165680/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-12 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"Effects of numerical dispersion on the accuracy of FDTD modeling of propagating and evanescent waves in negative index media","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5165680/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10788861","dateOfInsertion":"17 July 2009","conferenceDate":"7-12 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Effects of numerical dispersion on the accuracy of FDTD modeling of propagating and evanescent waves in negative index media","confLoc":"Boston, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"1761.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067999S","chronDate":"7-12 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5159259","isNumber":"5165586","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5159259","xplore-issue":"5165586","articleId":"5165680","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5165682,"authors":[{"name":"Roberto B.

Employing a recent combination of the sine-cosine technique with the array-scanning method, a large number of problems of interest can be efficiently terminated at periodic boundaries, which effectively act as absorbers. Hence, a unified treatment of inhomogeneous, dispersive and conductive media, each of which requires a reformulation of the perfectly matched layer, is attained, with an excellent performance that is not compromised by the close proximity of a source to the boundary. In addition, while the reflectivity of perfectly matched layers increases when the refractive index of the working volume is a non-analytic function, the proposed approach is not affected. The presence of non-periodic boundary conditions can still be accounted for by hybrid periodic/absorbing terminations.","doi":"10.1109/MWSYM.2009.5165700","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE MTT-S International Microwave Symposium Digest","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE MTT-S International Microwave Symposium Digest","pdfPath":"/iel5/5159259/5165586/05165700.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWSYM.2009.5165700","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5165586","startPage":"329","endPage":"332","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FDTD lattice termination with periodic boundary conditions","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5165700","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"FDTD lattice termination with periodic boundary conditions","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-12 June 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5165700/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"7-12 June 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10788764","dateOfInsertion":"17 July 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5165700/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FDTD lattice termination with periodic boundary conditions","confLoc":"Boston, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"1712.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066361S","chronDate":"7-12 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5159259","isNumber":"5165586","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5159259","xplore-issue":"5165586","articleId":"5165700","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5165705,"authors":[{"name":"Xiao-Ping Chen","affiliation":["Radiating Systems Group, Department of Applied Physics, Faculty of Physics, Ecole Polytechnique, Electronics Research of Quebec (CREER), Montreal, QUE, Canada"],"firstName":"Xiao-Ping","lastName":"Chen","id":"37403979700"},{"name":"Ke Wu","affiliation":["Radiating Systems Group, Department of Applied Physics, Faculty of Physics, Ecole Polytechnique, Electronics Research of Quebec (CREER), Montreal, QUE, Canada"],"firstName":"Ke","lastName":"Wu","id":"37278659100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2803-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2804-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0149-645X"}],"articleNumber":"5165705","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":48,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":2844},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low-loss ultra-wideband transition between conductor-backed coplanar waveguide and substrate integrated waveguide","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5165705","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Coplanar waveguides","Waveguide transitions","Ultra wideband technology","Circuits","Millimeter wave technology","Impedance","Inverters","Calibration","Waveguide components","Planar waveguides"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["coplanar waveguides","impedance matching","MIMIC","MMIC","substrate integrated waveguides","waveguide transitions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ultra-wideband transition","conductor-backed coplanar waveguide","substrate integrated waveguide","microwave integrated circuit","millimeter-wave integrated circuit","impedance matching","thru-reflection-line"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Substrate Integrated Waveguide (SIW)","conductor-backed coplanar waveguide (CBCPW)","transition","generalized impedance inverter","numerical Thru-Reflection-Line (TRL) calibration"]}],"abstract":"A novel transition between conductor-backed coplanar waveguide (CBCPW) and substrate integrated waveguide (SIW) is presented for microwave and millimeter-wave integrated circuit design.

In addition, the delay mismatch between the phase and amplitude paths in this digital polar transmitter has been evaluated.","doi":"10.1109/MWSYM.2009.5165718","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE MTT-S International Microwave Symposium Digest","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE MTT-S International Microwave Symposium Digest","pdfPath":"/iel5/5159259/5165586/05165718.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWSYM.2009.5165718","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5165586","startPage":"401","endPage":"404","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Phase wrapping digital polar transmitter for multi-band OFDM ultra-wideband system","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5165718","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Phase wrapping digital polar transmitter for multi-band OFDM ultra-wideband system","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-12 June 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5165718/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"7-12 June 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10788716","dateOfInsertion":"17 July 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5165718/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Phase wrapping digital polar transmitter for multi-band OFDM ultra-wideband system","confLoc":"Boston, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"1429.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042127S","chronDate":"7-12 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5159259","isNumber":"5165586","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5159259","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5165586","articleId":"5165718","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5165721,"authors":[{"name":"Jinsung Choi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Pohang University of Science and Technology, Gyeongsangbuk, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jinsung","lastName":"Choi","id":"37405962600"},{"name":"Dongsu Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Pohang University of Science and Technology, Gyeongsangbuk, South Korea"],"firstName":"Dongsu","lastName":"Kim","id":"37068059400"},{"name":"Daehyun Kang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Pohang University of Science and Technology, Gyeongsangbuk, South Korea"],"firstName":"Daehyun","lastName":"Kang","id":"37289143600"},{"name":"Myoungsu Jun","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Pohang University of Science and Technology, Gyeongsangbuk, South Korea"],"firstName":"Myoungsu","lastName":"Jun","id":"37574363400"},{"name":"Boshi Jin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Pohang University of Science and Technology, Gyeongsangbuk, South Korea"],"firstName":"Boshi","lastName":"Jin","id":"37288538400"},{"name":"Jungmin Park","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Pohang University of Science and Technology, Gyeongsangbuk, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jungmin","lastName":"Park","id":"37311239800"},{"name":"Bumman Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Pohang University of Science and Technology, Gyeongsangbuk, South Korea"],"firstName":"Bumman","lastName":"Kim","id":"37276226900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2803-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2804-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0149-645X"}],"articleNumber":"5165721","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":405},"abstract":"A polar transmitter supporting multi-standard applications through 0.13 um CMOS hysteretic-controlled hybrid switching amplifier is presented with 1.88 GHz HBT class-F PA operating with novel envelope shaping method for high efficiency and linearity over broad output power range.

At first, a Class-E PA design is carried out for dual-band operation based on the proposed modified Class-E condition. Then, the envelope tracking and digital predistortion techniques are applied to linearize the Class-E PA by improving the PA AM/AM and AM/PM distortions. Consequently, the designed Class-E PA, although classified as a switching-mode PA, can act as a linear PA for diverse high peak-to-average-power-ratio (PAPR) wireless systems. The experimental results show that a quadrature modulation transmitter incorporating the presented envelope-tracking dual-band Class-E PA can simultaneously achieve high average efficiency and adjacent channel power rejection for 1.95 GHz W-CDMA and 2.6 GHz WiMAX applications.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE MTT-S International Microwave Symposium

We train NNs to represent the EM behavior of the substructure as seen from the interface. This approach allows EM coupling effect between substructures to be better represented. The method is developed in the finite element method (FEM) environment. EM transfer function matrix is formulated to produce training data to allow the NN to learn the coupling between EM field variables at various locations across the entire interface of the 3D substructure. A new formulation allowing trained NN models to be connected with FEM equations of other substructures for efficient simulation of the overall EM structure is proposed. Examples of waveguide circuit simulations show that the proposed method provides better accuracy and efficiency over the conventional neural network method.","doi":"10.1109/MWSYM.2009.5165747","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE MTT-S International Microwave Symposium Digest","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE MTT-S International Microwave Symposium Digest","pdfPath":"/iel5/5159259/5165586/05165747.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWSYM.2009.5165747","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5165586","startPage":"517","endPage":"520","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neural network EM-Field based modeling for 3d substructure in finite element method","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5165747","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Neural network EM-Field based modeling for 3d substructure in finite element method","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-12 June 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5165747/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"7-12 June 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10788891","dateOfInsertion":"17 July 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5165747/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural network EM-Field based modeling for 3d substructure in finite element method","confLoc":"Boston, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"1826.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.131811S","chronDate":"7-12 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5159259","isNumber":"5165586","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5159259","xplore-issue":"5165586","articleId":"5165747","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5165751,"authors":[{"name":"Sataporn Pornpromlikit","affiliation":["University of California, La Jolla, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Sataporn","lastName":"Pornpromlikit","id":"37573068700"},{"name":"Jinho Jeong","affiliation":["Kwangwoon University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jinho","lastName":"Jeong","id":"37278333400"},{"name":"Calogero D.

To overcome the low breakdown voltage limit of MOSFETs, a stacked-FET structure is employed, where four transistors are connected in series so that their output voltage swings are added in phase. The stacked-FET PA has been designed to withstand up to 9 V of supply voltage before reaching its breakdown limit. The measurement results show that, with a 6.5-V supply, the PA achieves a small-signal gain of 13.2 dB, a saturated output power of 33 dBm, and a maximum power-added-efficiency (PAE) of 47% at 1.9 GHz. This is the first reported stacked-FET PA in submicron SOI CMOS technology that delivers multi-Watt output power in the GHz range. It also maintains high power efficiency over a wide range of supply voltages.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 33-dBm 1.9-GHz silicon-on-insulator CMOS stacked-FET power amplifier","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE MTT-S International Microwave Symposium Digest","doi":"10.1109/MWSYM.2009.5165751","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE MTT-S International Microwave Symposium Digest","pdfPath":"/iel5/5159259/5165586/05165751.pdf","startPage":"533","endPage":"536","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWSYM.2009.5165751","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5165586","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5165751","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5165751/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-12 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"A 33-dBm 1.9-GHz silicon-on-insulator CMOS stacked-FET power amplifier","conferenceDate":"7-12 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5165751/","dateOfInsertion":"17 July 2009","publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10779940","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 33-dBm 1.9-GHz silicon-on-insulator CMOS stacked-FET power amplifier","confLoc":"Boston, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"1783.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049261S","chronDate":"7-12 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5159259","isNumber":"5165586","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5159259","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"5165586","articleId":"5165751","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5165752,"authors":[{"name":"Debasis Dawn","affiliation":["Georgia Electronic Design Center, School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Debasis","lastName":"Dawn","id":"37311683200"},{"name":"Saikat Sarkar","affiliation":["Georgia Electronic Design Center, School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Saikat","lastName":"Sarkar","id":"37275242500"},{"name":"Padmanava Sen","affiliation":["Georgia Electronic Design Center, School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Padmanava","lastName":"Sen","id":"37275821400"},{"name":"Bevin Perumana","affiliation":["Georgia Electronic Design Center, School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Bevin","lastName":"Perumana","id":"37294375900"},{"name":"Matthew Leung","affiliation":["Georgia Electronic Design Center, School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Matthew","lastName":"Leung","id":"37308140300"},{"name":"Navin Mallavarpu","affiliation":["Georgia Electronic Design Center, School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Navin","lastName":"Mallavarpu","id":"37570347900"},{"name":"Stephane Pinel","affiliation":["Georgia Electronic Design Center, School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Stephane","lastName":"Pinel","id":"37269060800"},{"name":"Joy Laskar","affiliation":["Georgia Electronic Design Center, School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Joy","lastName":"Laskar","id":"37280282800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2803-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2804-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0149-645X"}],"articleNumber":"5165752","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":16,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1319},"abstract":"A 60 GHz power amplifier with 20 dB small signal gain is designed and fabricated using standard 1P7M 90 nm CMOS process technology.

The CMOS wideband LNA is with the merits of cost-effective and high-performance compared to the pure CMOS circuit.","doi":"10.1109/MWSYM.2009.5165786","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWSYM.2009.5165786","startPage":"673","endPage":"676","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE MTT-S International Microwave Symposium Digest","pdfPath":"/iel5/5159259/5165586/05165786.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE MTT-S International Microwave Symposium Digest","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5165586","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"CMOS wideband LNA design using integrated passive device","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"7-12 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"CMOS wideband LNA design using integrated passive device","conferenceDate":"7-12 June 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","dateOfInsertion":"17 July 2009","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5165786/","accessionNumber":"10780009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5165786/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"CMOS wideband LNA design using integrated passive device","confLoc":"Boston, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"1011.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.092217S","chronDate":"7-12 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5159259","isNumber":"5165586","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5159259","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"5165586","articleId":"5165786","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5165788,"authors":[{"name":"Eric W.

The new Ids formulation accurately predicts the asymmetric bell-shaped transconductance (gm) over a large drain-source bias range which is crucial in modeling high-power GaN HEMTs. A method of utilizing a combination of pulsed-gate (PGIV) and pulsed-gate-and-drain (PIV) IV measurements to characterize the dispersive behavior of GaN HEMT nonlinear Ids characteristics is developed. Dispersion due to self heating is modeled by modifying Ids parameters as a function of the temperature change and drain-source bias. Dispersion due to trapping is modeled using an effective gate-source voltage model. Accurate predictions of the RF small-signal and large-signal performance are demonstrated for two quiescent biases.","doi":"10.1109/MWSYM.2009.5165806","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE MTT-S International Microwave Symposium Digest","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE MTT-S International Microwave Symposium Digest","pdfPath":"/iel5/5159259/5165586/05165806.pdf","startPage":"753","endPage":"756","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWSYM.2009.5165806","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5165586","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5165806","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An improved empirical large-signal model for high-power GaN HEMTs including self-heating and charge-trapping effects","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"An improved empirical large-signal model for high-power GaN HEMTs including self-heating and charge-trapping effects","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5165806/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-12 June 2009","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5165806/","dateOfInsertion":"17 July 2009","publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10788901","conferenceDate":"7-12 June 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An improved empirical large-signal model for high-power GaN HEMTs including self-heating and charge-trapping effects","confLoc":"Boston, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"1705.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.032809S","chronDate":"7-12 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5159259","isNumber":"5165586","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5159259","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"5165586","articleId":"5165806","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-15"},{"_id":5165807,"authors":[{"name":"Ramon Beltran","affiliation":["CICESE, Ensenada, Baja California, Mexico"],"firstName":"Ramon","lastName":"Beltran","id":"37528671800"},{"name":"Frederick H.

Both CW and transient (i.e. pulsed and digitally modulated) thermal resistances are calculated for a range of transistor structures and sizes as a function of power density, pulse length and duty factor and compared with measured channel temperatures and RF parameters. The resulting thermal resistance values have then been imported into new ldquoself-heatingrdquo large signal models so that transistor channel temperatures and the resulting effects on RF performance such as gain, output power and efficiency can be determined during the amplifier design phase.

We propose the use of the new bisected-pi section to achieve larger gain, lower noise figure, and smaller area for the same bandwidth and matching characteristics. We show the theoretical basis for the improvement and confirm the result by comparing two otherwise identical distributed amplifiers in 130 nm CMOS. We measured a gain increase of approximately 1.2 dB and a noise figure reduction over the entire bandwidth of the amplifier. Additionally, the new topology uses fewer unique inductor sizes and smaller total inductor area to give reduced design time and cost. The pi-based approach should become the new standard for integrated distributed amplifier design.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Distributed amplifiers","Noise figure","Bandwidth","Inductors","Matched filters","Cutoff frequency","Gain measurement","Noise measurement","Topology","Costs"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS integrated circuits","distributed amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["alternative m-derived termination","bisected-T m-derived filter section","CMOS","integrated distributed amplifier design","size 130 nm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["distributed amplifier","lumped element microwave circuits"]}],"doi":"10.1109/MWSYM.2009.5165848","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE MTT-S International Microwave Symposium Digest","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE MTT-S International Microwave Symposium Digest","pdfPath":"/iel5/5159259/5165586/05165848.pdf","startPage":"921","endPage":"924","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5165586","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWSYM.2009.5165848","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Alternative m-derived termination for distributed amplifiers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5165848","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Alternative m-derived termination for distributed amplifiers","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5165848/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5165848/","accessionNumber":"10788757","conferenceDate":"7-12 June 2009","dateOfInsertion":"17 July 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-12 June 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Alternative m-derived termination for distributed amplifiers","confLoc":"Boston, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"1629.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.033676S","chronDate":"7-12 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5159259","isNumber":"5165586","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5159259","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5165586","articleId":"5165848","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5165849,"authors":[{"name":"Gil Wong Choi","affiliation":["Kwangwoon University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Gil Wong","lastName":"Choi","id":"37532124300"},{"name":"Hyoung Jong Kim","affiliation":["Kwangwoon University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Hyoung Jong","lastName":"Kim","id":"37310775700"},{"name":"Woong Jae Hwang","affiliation":["Kwangwoon University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Woong Jae","lastName":"Hwang","id":"37568104300"},{"name":"Suk Woo Shin","affiliation":["Kwangwoon University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Suk Woo","lastName":"Shin","id":"37536472600"},{"name":"Jin Joo Choi","affiliation":["Kwangwoon University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jin Joo","lastName":"Choi","id":"37280084700"},{"name":"Sung Jae Ha","affiliation":["Samsung Thales Company Limited, Yongin si, South Korea"],"firstName":"Sung Jae","lastName":"Ha","id":"37930343800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2803-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2804-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0149-645X"}],"articleNumber":"5165849","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":840},"abstract":"This paper describes the design and fabrication of a highly efficient switching-mode class-E Doherty power amplifier using gallium nitride (GaN) high-electron mobility transistor (HEMT) for S-band radar applications.

strong differential memory effects. A new scheme is introduced for removing the unwanted inband frequency components generated by the interband predistortion corrections, thus establishing full orthogonality between the interband and inband predistortion. The demonstration study is performed on a two-carrier OFDM signal of 8 MHz bandwidth each, separated by 16 MHz for a total RF bandwidth of 32 MHz. Both the OFDM signal generator and the new orthogonal multi-carrier linearization algorithm proposed were implemented in a field programmable gate array (FPGA) and applied to the experimental investigation of the linearization of a Class AB/Class C LDMOS PA at 3.5 GHz. It is demonstrated that with the new orthogonality implementation, 5 dB inband distortion introduced by the interband predistortion steps is automatically suppressed such that multiple iterative steps between the interband and inband linearizations are no longer required in the optimization. Adjacent channel leakage ratio (ACLR) of up to -45 dBc for inband and interband are demonstrated experimentally.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5165586","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWSYM.2009.5165887","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE MTT-S International Microwave Symposium Digest","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE MTT-S International Microwave Symposium Digest","pdfPath":"/iel5/5159259/5165586/05165887.pdf","startPage":"1077","endPage":"1080","doi":"10.1109/MWSYM.2009.5165887","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fully orthogonal multi-carrier predistortion linearization for RF power amplifiers","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-12 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"Fully orthogonal multi-carrier predistortion linearization for RF power amplifiers","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"7-12 June 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5165887/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10788803","dateOfInsertion":"17 July 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5165887/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fully orthogonal multi-carrier predistortion linearization for RF power amplifiers","confLoc":"Boston, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"1776.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04642S","chronDate":"7-12 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5159259","isNumber":"5165586","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5159259","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"5165586","articleId":"5165887","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5165888,"authors":[{"name":"Yong-Sub Lee","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, Pohang University of Science and Technology, Pohang, Gyeongsangbuk, South Korea"],"firstName":"Yong-Sub","lastName":"Lee","id":"37281125700"},{"name":"Mun-Woo Lee","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, Pohang University of Science and Technology, Pohang, Gyeongsangbuk, South Korea"],"firstName":"Mun-Woo","lastName":"Lee","id":"37405518800"},{"name":"Sang-Ho Kam","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, Pohang University of Science and Technology, Pohang, Gyeongsangbuk, South Korea"],"firstName":"Sang-Ho","lastName":"Kam","id":"37410698900"},{"name":"Yoon-Ha Jeong","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, Pohang University of Science and Technology, Pohang, Gyeongsangbuk, South Korea"],"firstName":"Yoon-Ha","lastName":"Jeong","id":"37278463700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2803-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2804-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0149-645X"}],"articleNumber":"5165888","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":195},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wideband","Multiaccess communication","Repeaters","Linearity","Signal processing","Broadband amplifiers","Delay","Power amplifiers","Testing","Power measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["broadband networks","code division multiple access","memoryless systems","radio repeaters","telecommunication channels","UHF power amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wideband multibranch analog predistorter","memory-effect compensation","multicarrier WCDMA repeater system","wideband code division multiple access system","class-AB power amplifier","adjacent channel leakage ratio","memoryless nonlinearity effect","power 30 W","frequency 2.14 GHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Analog predistorter","delay","memory effects","power amplifiers","wideband"]}],"abstract":"A wideband multi-branch analog predistorter (MBAPD) is reported to compensate for memory effects as well as memoryless nonlinearity of the power amplifier (PA) for multi-carrier wideband code division multiple access (WCDMA) repeater systems.

This study is performed at three different levels: the power amplifier level, the digital predistorter level, and the system level (linearized amplifier) for a Doherty amplifier driven by 3-carrier WCDMA signal. At the amplifier level, the use of crest factor reduction results in higher power efficiency, increased output power but also distortions. Experimental results show that this compromises the performance of the digital predistorter. The system level analysis highlighted that, in such case, the gained efficiency at the amplifier level will be lost after linearization. This is the first study that points out and experimentally reports the drawbacks of crest factor reduction when applied to digitally predistorted multi-carrier power amplifiers.","doi":"10.1109/MWSYM.2009.5165889","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWSYM.2009.5165889","startPage":"1085","endPage":"1088","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE MTT-S International

Some of the many new circuits and devices that this integration allows include high power analog-to-digital converters, high speed differential amplifiers, normally-off power transistors, and highly-compact power regulator circuits.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5165586","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE MTT-S International Microwave Symposium Digest","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE MTT-S International Microwave Symposium Digest","pdfPath":"/iel5/5159259/5165586/05165897.pdf","doi":"10.1109/MWSYM.2009.5165897","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWSYM.2009.5165897","startPage":"1117","endPage":"1120","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On-wafer integration of nitrides and Si devices: Bringing the power of polarization to Si","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"7-12 June 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5165897/","displayDocTitle":"On-wafer integration of nitrides and Si devices: Bringing the power of polarization to Si","htmlLink":"/document/5165897/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"7-12 June 2009","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"10788700","dateOfInsertion":"17 July 2009","publicationDate":"June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On-wafer integration of nitrides and Si devices: Bringing the power of polarization to Si","confLoc":"Boston, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"1758.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070238S","chronDate":"7-12 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5159259","isNumber":"5165586","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5159259","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5165586","articleId":"5165897","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5165899,"authors":[{"name":"Xueyang Geng","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Aubum University, AL, USA"],"firstName":"Xueyang","lastName":"Geng","id":"37391087700"},{"name":"Fa Foster Dai","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Aubum University, AL, USA"],"firstName":"Fa Foster","lastName":"Dai","id":"38183276400"},{"name":"J.

developed using compact package advanced GaN HEMTs which have Cds reduced 20%. A small-footprint Doherty network was successfully designed with plain small signal analysis, and the method was very practical. The Doherty PA exhibited a saturation output power of 52.5 dBm (178 W) and a saturated drain efficiency of 65.6%. The Doherty PA also achieved a drain efficiency of 55%, an ACLR of -52.8 dBc and a power gain of 13.8 dB at the average output power of 45.2 dBm (33 W) with 4-carrier W-CDMA signal at 2.6 GHz using commercially available digital pre-distortion system. These excellent performances show good suitability for 2.6 GHz band base stations (BTS), for example, W-CDMA, LTE and WiMAX, and small-sized circuit structure contributes to realize compact remote radio head type of BTS.","doi":"10.1109/MWSYM.2009.5165936","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE MTT-S International Microwave Symposium Digest","pdfPath":"/iel5/5159259/5165586/05165936.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5165586","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWSYM.2009.5165936","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE MTT-S International Microwave Symposium Digest","startPage":"1273","endPage":"1276","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 33W GaN HEMT Doherty amplifier with 55% drain efficiency for 2.6GHz base stations","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5165936","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-12 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"A 33W GaN HEMT Doherty amplifier with 55% drain efficiency for 2.6GHz base stations","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5165936/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5165936/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10788813","dateOfInsertion":"17 July 2009","conferenceDate":"7-12 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 33W GaN HEMT Doherty amplifier with 55% drain efficiency for 2.6GHz base stations","confLoc":"Boston, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"1403.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054993S","chronDate":"7-12 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5159259","isNumber":"5165586","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5159259","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"5165586","articleId":"5165936","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5165937,"authors":[{"name":"Mario Bokatius","affiliation":["RF Division, Freescale Semiconductor, Inc., Tempe, AZ, USA"],"firstName":"Mario","lastName":"Bokatius","id":"37572905000"},{"name":"Guillaume Bigny","affiliation":["RF Division, Freescale Semiconductor, Inc., Tempe, AZ, USA"],"firstName":"Guillaume","lastName":"Bigny","id":"37572904200"},{"name":"Paul Hart","affiliation":["RF Division, Freescale Semiconductor, Inc., Tempe, AZ, USA"],"firstName":"Paul","lastName":"Hart","id":"37574111600"},{"name":"John Wood","affiliation":["RF Division, Freescale Semiconductor, Inc., Tempe, AZ, USA"],"firstName":"John","lastName":"Wood","id":"37273103000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2803-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2804-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0149-645X"}],"articleNumber":"5165937","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":553},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power amplifiers","Power integrated circuits","GSM","Radiofrequency amplifiers","Linearity","Semiconductor optical amplifiers","Predistortion","Radio frequency","Application specific integrated circuits","Radiofrequency integrated circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","power integrated circuits","UHF integrated circuits","UHF power amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Doherty power amplifier","single-carrier GSM application","multicarrier GSM application","two-stage power amplifier IC building blocks","raw linearity","digital predistortion system","power 250 W","frequency 1.8 GHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Power amplifiers","Doherty","GSM","MC-GSM","error correction","digital predistortion"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5165937","doi":"10.1109/MWSYM.2009.5165937","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWSYM.2009.5165937","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5165586","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE MTT-S International Microwave Symposium Digest","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE MTT-S International Microwave Symposium Digest","pdfPath":"/iel5/5159259/5165586/05165937.pdf","startPage":"1277","endPage":"1280","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A linear 250 watt Doherty power amplifier based on two-stage power ICs for 1.8 GHz single and multi-carrier GSM applications","abstract":"In this paper we describe the design and measured performance of a Doherty power amplifier constructed using two-stage power amplifier IC building blocks.

Incorporating stents with a miniature implantable sensory device allows for internal monitoring of nearly any location within the cardiovascular system. We assembled an implantable stent-based transmitter by integrating a 2.4 GHz wireless transmitter, battery, and two stents configured as a dipole radiator. The radiative properties of the dipole stents was quantified through free space, ex vivo experiments on excised tissue, and in vivo studies on porcine subjects. The in vivo results from various receive distances (10 cm to 1 m) showed a 33-35 dB power reduction while implanted at a 3.5 cm depth within the chest. This validates the ability of using stents to wirelessly transmit data from deep within a living body.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High frequency transcutaneous transmission using stents configured as a dipole radiator for cardiovascular implantable devices","doi":"10.1109/MWSYM.2009.5165947","endPage":"1320","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE MTT-S International Microwave Symposium Digest","pdfPath":"/iel5/5159259/5165586/05165947.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE MTT-S International Microwave Symposium Digest","startPage":"1317","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWSYM.2009.5165947","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5165586","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5165947","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Frequency","Cardiology","Wireless sensor networks","Transmitters","In vivo","Telemetry","Drugs","Surgery","Monitoring","Cardiovascular system"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biological tissues","biomedical telemetry","cardiology","dipole antennas","prosthetics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high frequency transcutaneous transmission","stents","dipole radiator","cardiovascular implantable devices","transcutaneous wireless telemetry","implantable stent-based transmitter","radiative properties","porcine","cardiovascular system","internal monitoring","excised tissue","frequency 2.4 GHz","distance 10 cm to 1 m","depth 3.5 cm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Biomedical applications of electromagnetic radiation","biomedical monitoring","biomedical telemetry","implantable biomedical devices"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"High frequency transcutaneous transmission using stents configured as a dipole radiator for cardiovascular implantable devices","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5165947/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-12 June 2009","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5165947/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","conferenceDate":"7-12 June 2009","dateOfInsertion":"17 July 2009","accessionNumber":"10788676","isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High frequency transcutaneous transmission using stents configured as a dipole radiator for cardiovascular implantable devices","confLoc":"Boston, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"1849.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050585S","chronDate":"7-12 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5159259","isNumber":"5165586","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5159259","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"5165586","articleId":"5165947","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":5165949,"authors":[{"name":"Rich Fletcher","affiliation":["Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Rich","lastName":"Fletcher","id":"37410021400"},{"name":"Jing Han","affiliation":["Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"lastName":"Jing Han","id":"37576407600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2803-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2804-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0149-645X"}],"articleNumber":"5165949","dbTime":"21 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":59,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":1290},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Doppler radar","Monitoring","Radar antennas","Radar detection","Helical antennas","Microstrip antennas","Automotive engineering","Health and safety","Security","Performance evaluation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomedical telemetry","helical antennas","patient monitoring","radar antennas","radar detection","safety systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low-cost differential front-end","Doppler radar vital sign monitoring","vital sign detection","automotive driver safety systems","health monitoring","security screening","dual helical antennas","baseband signal","motion cancellation","direct-conversion radar circuits","frequency 2.460 GHz","frequency 2.510 GHz","distance 0.5 m"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["vital sign","biomedical signal detection","heart rate","Doppler radar","differential","helical antenna"]}],"abstract":"We present a differential front end design for improving the performance of short-range low-cost Doppler radars for vital sign detection with application to automotive driver safety systems, health monitoring, and security screening.

Instead of deriving the base-band Volterra model from the RF Volterra model, we started by a general Volterra series expansion of a complex-signal to only then impose the restrictions of odd parity required by the low-pass equivalent polynomial approximation. This way, not only we prove that the theoretical reticence that was raised to similar approaches previously proposed for the memoryless polynomial and the memory polynomial were unfounded, as experimental results fully justified this novel approach.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE MTT-S International Microwave Symposium Digest","pdfPath":"/iel5/5159259/5165586/05165958.pdf","startPage":"1361","endPage":"1364","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE MTT-S International Microwave Symposium Digest","doi":"10.1109/MWSYM.2009.5165958","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWSYM.2009.5165958","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5165586","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5165958","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Base-band derived volterra series for power amplifier modeling","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power amplifiers","Polynomials","Radio frequency","Chebyshev approximation","Radiofrequency amplifiers","Telecommunications","Power system modeling","Nonlinear systems","Hydrogen","Predistortion"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["polynomial approximation","power amplifiers","radiofrequency amplifiers","Volterra series"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power amplifier modeling","low-pass equivalent complex-signal Volterra models","band-pass RF real-signal Volterra models","low-pass equivalent polynomial approximation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Chebyshev functions","modeling","nonlinear systems","power amplifiers","Volterra series"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5165958/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-12 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"Base-band derived volterra series for power amplifier modeling","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5165958/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10788724","dateOfInsertion":"17 July 2009","conferenceDate":"7-12 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Base-band derived volterra series for power amplifier modeling","confLoc":"Boston, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"1256.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039477S","chronDate":"7-12 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5159259","isNumber":"5165586","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5159259","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"5165586","articleId":"5165958","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5165959,"authors":[{"name":"Per Niklas Landin","affiliation":["Center for RF Measurement Technology, University of G\u00e4vle, Gavle, Sweden","Signal Processing Laboratory, Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden"],"firstName":"Per Niklas","lastName":"Landin","id":"37697726000"},{"name":"Charles Nader","affiliation":["Center for RF Measurement Technology, University of G\u00e4vle, Gavle, Sweden","Signal Processing Laboratory, Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden"],"firstName":"Charles","lastName":"Nader","id":"37392084300"},{"name":"Niclas Bjorsell","affiliation":["Center for RF Measurement Technology, University of G\u00e4vle, Gavle, Sweden"],"firstName":"Niclas","lastName":"Bjorsell","id":"37299462500"},{"name":"Magnus Isaksson","affiliation":["Center for RF Measurement Technology, University of G\u00e4vle, Gavle, Sweden"],"firstName":"Magnus","lastName":"Isaksson","id":"37300472700"},{"name":"David Wisell","affiliation":["Ericsson AB, Stockholm, Sweden"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Wisell","id":"37300921100"},{"name":"Peter Handel","affiliation":["Center for RF Measurement Technology, University of G\u00e4vle, Gavle, Sweden","Signal Processing Laboratory, Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden"],"firstName":"Peter","lastName":"Handel","id":"37281593600"},{"name":"Olav Andersen","affiliation":["Ericsson AB, Gavle, Sweden"],"firstName":"Olav","lastName":"Andersen","id":"37285244100"},{"name":"Niclas Keskitalo","affiliation":["Center for RF Measurement Technology, University of G\u00e4vle, Gavle, Sweden","Ericsson AB, Stockholm, Sweden"],"firstName":"Niclas","lastName":"Keskitalo","id":"37316599600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2803-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2804-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0149-645X"}],"articleNumber":"5165959","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":275},"abstract":"In this paper a radio frequency power amplifier is measured and characterized by the use of undersampling based on the generalized Zhu-Frank sampling theorem.

When the envelope tracking technique is applied to the broadband signals such as WiMAX and LTE, the wide bandwidth of the envelope signal makes it difficult to implement the dynamic power supply efficiently and accurately. We show here for the first time a technique to reduce the bandwidth of the dynamic power supply voltage, thereby allowing better efficiency for the dynamic power supply; and a linearization method for correcting the nonlinearity caused by the bandwidth reduction. The feasibility of this technique is demonstrated for a single carrier WCDMA signal with 7.8-dB PAPR using a GaAs HVHBT PA. The bandwidth of the power supply signal is reduced from 20 MHz to 5 MHz. After linearization, the reduced bandwidth envelope tracking PA exhibits an average output power of 25 W, an average gain of 13 dB and an overall power-added efficiency of 50%. The measured normalized RMS error is as low as 3.98% with an adjacent channel leakage ratio of -41 dBc and -48 dBc at offset frequencies of 5 MHz and 10 MHz,

For the asymmetrical class-F DPA with PDDs, an ACLR of -38.2 dBc is achieved the total drain efficiency of 37.2 % and a total gain of 26.5 dB.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5165586","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWSYM.2009.5165966","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE MTT-S International Microwave Symposium Digest","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE MTT-S International Microwave Symposium Digest","pdfPath":"/iel5/5159259/5165586/05165966.pdf","startPage":"1393","endPage":"1396","doi":"10.1109/MWSYM.2009.5165966","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Highly linear and efficient asymmetrical Doherty power amplifiers with adaptively bias-controlled predistortion drivers","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-12 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"Highly linear and efficient asymmetrical Doherty power amplifiers with adaptively bias-controlled predistortion drivers","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"7-12 June 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5165966/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10788608","dateOfInsertion":"17 July 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5165966/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Highly linear and efficient asymmetrical Doherty power amplifiers with adaptively bias-controlled predistortion drivers","confLoc":"Boston, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"1182.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077818S","chronDate":"7-12 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5159259","isNumber":"5165586","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5159259","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"5165586","articleId":"5165966","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5165998,"authors":[{"name":"Christian Schuberth","affiliation":["Institute of Electrical Measurements and Circuit Design, University of Technology, Vienna, Vienna, Austria"],"firstName":"Christian","lastName":"Schuberth","id":"37547033400"},{"name":"Peter Singerl","affiliation":["Infineon Technologies, Austria"],"firstName":"Peter","lastName":"Singerl","id":"37422196700"},{"name":"Holger Arthaber","affiliation":["Institute of Electrical Measurements and Circuit Design, University of Technology, Vienna, Vienna, Austria"],"firstName":"Holger","lastName":"Arthaber","id":"37296223000"},{"name":"Michael Gadringer","affiliation":["Institute of Electrical Measurements and Circuit Design, University of Technology, Vienna, Vienna, Austria"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Gadringer","id":"37296224600"},{"name":"Gottfried Magerl","affiliation":["Institute of Electrical Measurements and Circuit Design, University of Technology, Vienna, Vienna, Austria"],"firstName":"Gottfried","lastName":"Magerl","id":"37296221100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2803-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2804-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0149-645X"}],"articleNumber":"5165998","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1330},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radiofrequency amplifiers","RLC circuits","High power amplifiers","Current measurement","Microwave amplifiers","Switches","FETs","Voltage","Electric variables measurement","Power amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["current-mode circuits","MOSFET","radiofrequency amplifiers","time-domain analysis","UHF amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMCD amplifier","current mode class-D amplifier","RF amplifier","inverted class-F amplifier","LDMOS FET","active harmonic load-pull technique","time domain waveform","power-added efficiency","frequency 900 MHz","power 25 W","efficiency 61.5 percent"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Current mode class-D amplifier","high efficiency","LDMOS","microwave measurements","microwave power amplifiers","switching amplifiers"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5165998","abstract":"This work presents the design of a current mode class-D (CMCD) amplifier using a measurement based approach.

Measurements of a commercially available 1W GaAs FET device demonstrate at least an eight-fold improvement in the measurement speed when compared to existing open-loop solutions. The developed active load-pull system, which instantly reacts, via baseband feedback, has the ability to set load impedances that are independent of changing device conditions. Thus it is similar to passive systems, but without the associated loss.

The passive triplexer circuit with 8 passive elements was comprised of a diplexer, parallel resonator, and matching network. A fabricated quintplexer module with meshed ground plane exhibited insertion losses of -2.2 dB/-2.8 dB at DCN Tx/Rx band, -2.8 dB/-3.2 dB at US-PCS Tx/Rx band, and -1.2 dB at GPS Rx band, respectively. In addition, the stop-band attenuation performances are -50 dB/-50 dB at DCN Tx/Rx band, -52 dB/-42 dB at PCS Tx/Rx band, and -35 dB at GPS Rx band, respectively. The applied meshed ground plane was confirmed to be effective for improving the quality factors of the embedded inductors resulting in low insertion loss and high isolation characteristics of the embedded triplexer circuit.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE MTT-S International Microwave Symposium Digest","pdfPath":"/iel5/5159259/5165586/05166025.pdf","startPage":"1629","endPage":"1632","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE MTT-S International Microwave Symposium Digest","doi":"10.1109/MWSYM.2009.5166025","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWSYM.2009.5166025","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5165586","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5166025","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Compact quintplexer module with meshed ground plane for US-CDMA handset applications","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Telephone sets","Circuits","Insertion loss","Q factor","Inductors","Global Positioning System","Surface acoustic waves","Film bulk acoustic resonators","Attenuation","Personal communication networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","inductors","mobile handsets","multiplexing equipment","printed circuits","Q-factor"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compact quintplexer module","meshed ground plane","US-CDMA handset applications","PCB embedded passive triplexer circuit","SAW duplexer","DCN band","FBAR duplexer","US-PCS band","diplexer","parallel resonator","matching network","stop-band attenuation","loss -2.2 dB","loss -2.8 dB","loss -3.2 dB","loss -1.2 dB"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Front-end module","passive triplexer","PCB embedded","quintplexer","SOP based","US-CDMA"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5166025/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-12 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"Compact quintplexer module with meshed ground plane for US-CDMA handset applications","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5166025/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10788737","dateOfInsertion":"17 July 2009","conferenceDate":"7-12 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Compact quintplexer module with meshed ground plane for US-CDMA handset applications","confLoc":"Boston, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"1868.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054967S","chronDate":"7-12 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5159259","isNumber":"5165586","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5159259","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5165586","articleId":"5166025","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5166110,"authors":[{"name":"Fahad Ali Usmani","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering, Aligarh Muslim University, Aligarh, India"],"firstName":"Fahad Ali","lastName":"Usmani","id":"37570504600"},{"name":"Mohd.

DETFF-based design, however, requires multiple runs of timing analysis, which is critical for short turn-around time; to make it worse, the number of analysis increases if we use clock gating and multiple clock gating logic, both of which are typical in practical designs. Alternative approach is to perform analysis once assuming the tightest timing condition, which turns out to be too pessimistic. Timing analysis method for DETFF-based circuit with clock gating is proposed for the first time. The method is based on identifying a cluster of nets that have to be associated with multiple required arrival times (RATs); the remaining nets having a single RAT then can be processed by conventional timing analysis. Experiments with several benchmark circuits in 65-nm technology demonstrate that, at 50% point of cumulative slack histogram, the slack from our analysis was 1.78times on average of the slack from conventional timing analysis assuming the tightest timing condition, and 1.30times at 90% point.","doi":"10.1109/ICICDT.2009.5166265","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on IC Design and Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on IC Design and Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/5159181/5166240/05166265.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICICDT.2009.5166265","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5166240","startPage":"59","endPage":"62","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Timing analysis of dual-edge-triggered flip-flop based circuits with clock gating","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5166265","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Timing analysis of dual-edge-triggered flip-flop based circuits with clock gating","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 May 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5166265/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"18-20 May 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10779772","dateOfInsertion":"17 July 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5166265/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Timing analysis of dual-edge-triggered flip-flop based circuits with clock gating","confLoc":"Austin, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"D4.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045415S","chronDate":"18-20 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5159181","isNumber":"5166240","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5159181","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5166240","articleId":"5166265","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5166273,"authors":[{"name":"Hao-I Yang","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering & Institute of Electronics, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Hao-I Yang","id":"37403884800"},{"name":"Ching-Te Chuang","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering & Institute of Electronics, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Ching-Te Chuang","id":"37268438500"},{"name":"Wei Hwang","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering & Institute of Electronics, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Wei Hwang","id":"37285310100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2933-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2934-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2381-3555"}],"articleNumber":"5166273","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":164},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Electric breakdown","Random access memory","Semiconductor device modeling","CMOS technology","Circuit stability","MOS devices","Phase frequency detector","Power engineering and energy","Degradation","Circuit synthesis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["integrated circuit design","integrated circuit noise","semiconductor device breakdown","SRAM chips","transistor circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["gate-oxide breakdown","power-gated SRAM","column-based header-gated SRAM","footer-gated SRAM","read static noise margin","write margin","cell transistor","drain-to-drain BD","power switch"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["gate-oxide breakdown","power gating technology","SRAM"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5166273","abstract":"This paper presents a detailed analysis on the impacts of various gate-oxide breakdown (BD) paths in column-based header- and footer-gated SRAMs. It is shown that with gate-oxide BD, the RSNM (read static noise margin) degrades, while the WM (write margin) improves in general.

The shared L2 cache reduces the required rate of main memory access to 310 MB/s. In the minimum workload of AAC decoding, three low-power circuit techniques reduce 98% of leakage. On-chip regulators, which also work as power-gating switches, lower the supply voltage of processing cores. Embedded forward body-biasing circuit reduces Vt variations.

The method of determining the stress condition is explained to achieve the maximum substrate current where maximum damage is generated in NMOSFETs. The increase in threshold voltage caused by hot carriers leads to a drop in the biasing current of the transistors. These effects lead to a decrease in the transconductance and output conductance of the device. There is almost no change in the subthreshold swing, gate-source and gate-drain capacitances. In the LNA, a drop of the power gain, power consumption, figure of merit (FoM) and an increase of the noise figure have been observed after hot carrier stress.

These techniques use the ratio between the largest and the smallest eigenvalues of the received signal covariance matrix to infer the presence or absence of the primary signal. The results derived so far are based on asymptotical assumptions, due to the difficulties in characterizing the exact eigenvalues ratio distribution. By exploiting a recent result on the limiting distribution of the smallest eigenvalue in complex Wishart matrices, in this paper we derive an expression for the limiting eigenvalue ratio distribution, which turns out to be much more accurate than the previous approximations also in the non-asymptotical region. This result is then applied to calculate the decision sensing threshold as a function of a target probability of false alarm. Numerical simulations show that the proposed detection rule provides a substantial improvement compared to the other eigenvalue-based algorithms.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/4234/5166410/05166426.pdf","startPage":"507","endPage":"509","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","doi":"10.1109/LCOMM.2009.090425","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCOMM.2009.090425","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5166410","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5166426","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cooperative spectrum sensing based on the limiting eigenvalue ratio distribution in wishart matrices","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","Covariance matrix","Cognitive radio","Receiving antennas","Gaussian noise","Probability","Numerical simulation","Detection algorithms","Computer vision","Computational fluid dynamics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","matrix algebra","signal detection","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cooperative spectrum sensing","eigenvalue ratio distribution","Wishart matrix","random matrix theory","cognitive radio","decision sensing threshold"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cognitive radio, spectrum sensing, random matrix theory."]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5166426/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 July 2009","displayDocTitle":"Cooperative spectrum sensing based on the limiting eigenvalue ratio distribution in wishart matrices","volume":"13","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/5166426/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2009","accessionNumber":"10791401","dateOfInsertion":"21 July 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cooperative spectrum sensing based on the limiting eigenvalue ratio distribution in wishart matrices","sourcePdf":"0507-cl0907-penna.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.042561S","chronDate":"July  2009","xplore-pub-id":"4234","isNumber":"5166410","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4234","citationCount":"125","xplore-issue":"5166410","articleId":"5166426","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5166428,"authors":[{"name":"Ashwani Singh","affiliation":["VLSI Laboratory, Dipartimento di Elettronica, Politecnico di Torino, Torino, Italy","Lab-Sticc, CNRS, UBS, Universit\u00e9 Europ\u00e9enne de Bretagne, Lorient, France"],"firstName":"Ashwani","lastName":"Singh","id":"37576132200"},{"name":"Ali Al-Ghouwayel","affiliation":["Lab-Sticc, CNRS, UBS, Universit\u00e9 Europ\u00e9enne de Bretagne, Lorient, France"],"firstName":"Ali","lastName":"Al-Ghouwayel","id":"37320220900"},{"name":"Guido Masera","affiliation":["VLSI Laboratory, Dipartimento di Elettronica, Politecnico di Torino, Torino, Italy"],"firstName":"Guido","lastName":"Masera","id":"37296188300"},{"name":"Emmanuel Boutillon","affiliation":["Lab-Sticc, CNRS, UBS, Universit\u00e9 Europ\u00e9enne de Bretagne, Lorient, France"],"firstName":"Emmanuel","lastName":"Boutillon","id":"37281706400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"5166428","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":154},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Iterative decoding","Bit error rate","Iterative algorithms","Parity check codes","Entropy","Testing","Turbo codes","Signal to noise ratio","Computational modeling","Gaussian noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["binary codes","iterative decoding","parity check codes","probability","turbo codes","WiMax"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["performance evaluation metric","iterative sub-optimal decoding algorithms","a-posteriori probability decoded symbol","suboptimal decoding algorithms","binary turbo codes","WiMax (802.16e) application","Galois Field","low density parity check code","LDPC","BER"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Turbo codes, LDPC codes, a-posteriori probability, Monte Carlo simulation, entropy."]}],"abstract":"In this letter, a new metric for fast and efficient performance comparison of iterative sub-optimal decoding algorithms is proposed.

Using this approach, the max* operator is approximated by means of a generic and yet very simple max operator, instead of using additional correction term as previous approximation methods require. Following that, several turbo decoding algorithms are obtained with optimal and near-optimal bit error rate (BER) performance depending on a single parameter, namely the number of piecewise linear (PWL) approximation terms. It turns out that the known max-log-MAP algorithm can be viewed as special case of this new generalized approach.

The parity-check matrices of the newly constructed subcodes are composed of several square matrices, which can be viewed as elements of a finite field. Therefore the FFT-based a posteriori probability (APP) algorithm for nonbinary codes can be applied to decode the subcodes. When compared with the trellis-based APP algorithm, the FFT-based APP algorithm can be implemented in parallel and has lower complexity.

To estimate the object's location, one can take a sliding window approach, but this strongly increases the computational cost because the classifier or similarity function has to be evaluated over a large set of candidate subwindows. In this paper, we propose a simple yet powerful branch and bound scheme that allows efficient maximization of a large class of quality functions over all possible subimages. It converges to a globally optimal solution typically in linear or even sublinear time, in contrast to the quadratic scaling of exhaustive or sliding window search. We show how our method is applicable to different object detection and image retrieval scenarios. The achieved speedup allows the use of classifiers for localization that formerly were considered too slow for this task, such as SVMs with a spatial pyramid kernel or nearest-neighbor classifiers based on the lambda\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n distance.

Two equivalent models of the HMSIW are introduced. With the first model, equations are derived to approximate the field distribution inside and outside the HMSIW. Using the second model, an approximate closed-form expression is deduced for calculating the equivalent width of an HMSIW that takes into account the effect of the fringing fields. The obtained design formulas are validated by simulations and experiments. Furthermore, the attenuation characteristics of the HMSIW are studied using the multiline method in the frequency range of 20-60 GHz. A numerical investigation is carried out to distinguish between the contributions of the conductive, dielectric, and radiation losses. As a validation, the measured attenuation constant of a fabricated HMSIW prototype is presented and compared with that of a microstrip (MS) line and a substrate integrated waveguide (SIW). The SIW is designed with the same cutoff frequency and fabricated on the same substrate as the HMSIW. The experimental results show that the HMSIW can be less lossy than the MS line and the SIW at frequencies above 40 GHz.","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.2009.2025429","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel5/22/5200722/05166451.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.2009.2025429","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5200722","startPage":"1996","endPage":"2004","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Characterization of the Propagation Properties of the Half-Mode Substrate Integrated Waveguide","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5166451","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Characterization of the Propagation Properties of the Half-Mode Substrate Integrated Waveguide","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5166451/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 July 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"57","issue":"8","publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","accessionNumber":"10816575","dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5166451/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Characterization of the Propagation Properties of the Half-Mode Substrate Integrated Waveguide","sourcePdf":"tmtt-lai-2025429.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.06668S","chronDate":"Aug.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"5200722","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"240","xplore-issue":"5200722","articleId":"5166451","onlineDate":"17 July 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-29"},{"_id":5166452,"authors":[{"name":"Paolo Colantonio","affiliation":["Electronic Engineering Department, University of Roma Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/5200722/5166452/5166452-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Paolo Colantonio was born in Rome, Italy, on March 22, 1969.

The bonded structure also forms a package for the MEMS switches. This paper investigates the design and fabrication issues and presents the measured data related to yield and frequency response of this lens-array.

Simulation results show that the proposed schemes have better PAPR reduction performance with shaping gain than the conventional SLM scheme for the QAM modulated OFDM signals, especially for the small number of subcarriers.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bit-Based SLM Schemes for PAPR Reduction in QAM Modulated OFDM Signals","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting","doi":"10.1109/TBC.2009.2025977","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting","pdfPath":"/iel5/11/5210245/05166454.pdf","startPage":"679","endPage":"685","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBC.2009.2025977","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5210245","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5166454","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5166454/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 July 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2009","displayDocTitle":"Bit-Based SLM Schemes for PAPR Reduction in QAM Modulated OFDM Signals","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"55","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/5166454/","dateOfInsertion":"21 August 2009","publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10840316","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bit-Based SLM Schemes for PAPR Reduction in QAM Modulated OFDM Signals","sourcePdf":"tbc-jeon-2025977.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.079366S","chronDate":"Sept.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"11","isNumber":"5210245","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"11","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"5210245","articleId":"5166454","onlineDate":"17 July 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5166455,"authors":[{"name":"Wei Lin","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Mathematics of Nonlinear Sciences, Chinese Ministry of Education, School of Mathematical Sciences and the Centre of Computational Systems Biology, Fudan University, Shanghai, China","CAS-MPG Partner Institute of Computational Biology, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Lin","id":"37087189497"},{"name":"Guanrong Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Guanrong","lastName":"Chen","id":"37277942500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1045-9227"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0093"}],"articleNumber":"5166455","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":19,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1285},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computational Intelligence Society","url":"http://ieee-cis.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Chaos","Artificial neural networks","Neurons","Neural networks","Associative memory","Intelligent networks","Biological neural networks","Mathematical model","Artificial intelligence","Information processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["chaos","content-addressable storage","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["large memory capacity","chaotic artificial neural networks","sinusoidal activation functions","monotonic activation functions","sigmoidal functions","antiintegrable limit technique","finite-dimensional neural network","periodic activation functions","chaotic dynamics","memory capacity","pattern-retrieval ability"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Anti-integrable limit","artificial neural network","chaos","periodic activation function"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Action Potentials","Algorithms","Computer Simulation","Neural Networks (Computer)","Neurons","Periodicity","Time Factors"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5166455","abstract":"In the literature, it was reported that the chaotic artificial neural network model with sinusoidal activation functions possesses a large memory capacity as well as a remarkable ability of retrieving the stored patterns, better than the conventional chaotic model with only monotonic activation functions such as sigmoidal functions.

Therefore, these devices must be adequately tested after manufacture and during bioassay operations. Known techniques for biochip testing are all function oblivious (i.e., while they can detect and locate defect sites on a microfluidic array, they cannot be used to ensure correct operation of functional units). In this paper, we introduce the concept of functional testing of microfluidic biochips. We address fundamental biochip operations, such as droplet dispensing, droplet transportation, mixing, splitting, and capacitive sensing. Long electrode actuation times are avoided to ensure that there is no electrode degradation during testing. The functional testing of pin-constrained biochips is also studied. We evaluate the proposed test methods using simulations as well as experiments for a fabricated biochip.","doi":"10.1109/TBCAS.2009.2022173","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4156126/5173737/05166457.pdf","startPage":"241","endPage":"253","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBCAS.2009.2022173","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5173737","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fault Modeling and Functional Test Methods for Digital Microfluidic Biochips","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5166457/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 July 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2009","displayDocTitle":"Fault Modeling and Functional Test Methods for Digital Microfluidic Biochips","volume":"3","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","accessionNumber":"10793253","pubMedId":"23853245","htmlLink":"/document/5166457/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"24 July 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fault Modeling and Functional Test Methods for Digital Microfluidic Biochips","sourcePdf":"tbcas-txu-2022173.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073842S","chronDate":"Aug.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"4156126","isNumber":"5173737","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4156126","citationCount":"43","xplore-issue":"5173737","articleId":"5166457","onlineDate":"17 July 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5166462,"authors":[{"name":"Fernando Briz","affiliation":["Department of Electrical, Computer, and Systems Engineering, University of Oviedo, Gijon, Spain"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/28/5247116/5166462/5166462-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Fernando Briz (A'96\u2013M'99\u2013SM'06) received the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees from the University of Oviedo, Gij\u00f3n, Spain, in 1990 and 1996, respectively.","From June 1996 to March 1997, he was a Visiting Researcher at the University of Wisconsin, Madison.

In both cases, high-frequency (in the range of the hundred hertz) voltage components at well-defined frequencies are created. The negative-sequence currents induced from these high-frequency voltages are shown to contain accurate information on the level of asymmetry (fault) in the machine. This information is significantly richer than exists in other modes of operation, i.e., inverters working in the linear modulation region or soft-starters in the steady state, and provides interesting opportunities to complement other diagnostic methods.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.-oct.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5166462/","volume":"45","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/5166462/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept.-oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"10870627","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"18 September 2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 July 2009","displayDocTitle":"Stator Windings Fault Diagnostics of Induction Machines Operated From Inverters and Soft-Starters Using High-Frequency Negative-Sequence Currents","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Stator Windings Fault Diagnostics of Induction Machines Operated From Inverters and Soft-Starters Using High-Frequency Negative-Sequence Currents","sourcePdf":"tia-briz-2027198.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.095354S","chronDate":"Sept.-oct.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"28","isNumber":"5247116","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"28","citationCount":"54","xplore-issue":"5247116","articleId":"5166462","onlineDate":"17 July 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":5166466,"authors":[{"name":"Jose A.

Moreover, in this paper, an analytical comparison with an alternative time-frequency decomposition tool, i.e., the \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">discrete</i>\n \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">wavelet</i>\n \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">transform</i>\n (DWT), is carried out. This tool was applied in previous works to the transient extraction of fault-related components, with satisfactory results, even in cases in which the classical Fourier approach does not lead to correct results. The results of the application of the HHT and DWT are analyzed and compared, obtaining novel conclusions about their respective suitability for the transient extraction of asymmetry-related components, as well as the equivalence, with regard to the LSH extraction, between their basic components, namely: 1) \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">intrinsic</i>\n \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">mode</i>\n \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">function</i>\n, for the HHT, and 2) \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">approximation</i>\n \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">signal</i>\n for the DWT.","doi":"10.1109/TIA.2009.2027558","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/28/5247116/05166466.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIA.2009.2027558","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5247116","startPage":"1794","endPage":"1803","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Critical Comparison Between DWT and Hilbert\u2013Huang-Based Methods for the Diagnosis of Rotor Bar Failures in Induction Machines","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5166466","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Critical Comparison Between DWT and Hilbert\u2013Huang-Based Methods for the Diagnosis of Rotor Bar Failures in Induction Machines","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.-oct.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5166466/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 July 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"45","issue":"5","publicationDate":"Sept.-oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"10870630","dateOfInsertion":"18 September 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5166466/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Critical Comparison Between DWT and Hilbert\u2013Huang-Based Methods for the Diagnosis of Rotor Bar Failures in Induction Machines","sourcePdf":"tia-antoninodaviu-2027558.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.111562S","chronDate":"Sept.-oct.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"28","isNumber":"5247116","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"28","citationCount":"102","xplore-issue":"5247116","articleId":"5166466","onlineDate":"17 July 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5166470,"authors":[{"name":"G.

We characterized the effect of this beamformer on signal quality in an experimental radio-over-fiber (ROF) link by externally modulating and transmitting an IEEE 802.11a compliant signal over the beamformer. The measured error vector magnitude of the received signal confirmed that there was no additive distortion or noise, and consequently, we achieved error-free transmission for the highest possible bit rate. Finally, we demonstrated the capability of this beamformer in beam-/null-steering and SLR reductions by measuring the radiation pattern of the array antenna of an optimized DWDM-ROF link.

This paper presents a methodology for inferring road type and traffic congestion (RT&TC) levels from available onboard vehicle data and then using this information for improved vehicle power management. A machine-learning algorithm has been developed to learn the critical knowledge about fuel efficiency on 11 facility-specific drive cycles representing different road types and traffic congestion levels, as well as a neural learning algorithm for the training of a neural network to predict the RT&TC level. An online University of Michigan-Dearborn intelligent power controller (UMD_IPC) applies this knowledge to real-time vehicle power control to achieve improved fuel efficiency. UMD_IPC has been fully implemented in a conventional (nonhybrid) vehicle model in the powertrain systems analysis toolkit (PSAT) environment. Simulations conducted on the standard drive cycles provided by the PSAT show that the performance of the UMD_IPC algorithm is very close to the offline controller that is generated using a dynamic programming optimization approach. Furthermore, UMD_IPC gives improved fuel consumption in a conventional vehicle, alternating neither the vehicle structure nor its components.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 July 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5166473/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2009","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"58","issue":"9","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"10 November 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5166473/","accessionNumber":"10966630","displayDocTitle":"Intelligent Vehicle Power Control Based on Machine Learning of Optimal Control Parameters and Prediction of Road Type and Traffic Congestion","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Intelligent Vehicle Power Control Based on Machine Learning of Optimal Control Parameters and Prediction of Road Type and Traffic Congestion","sourcePdf":"tvt-park-2027710.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.078307S","chronDate":"Nov.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"5307285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"78","xplore-issue":"5307285","articleId":"5166473","onlineDate":"17 July 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5166476,"authors":[{"name":"David D\u00cdaz Reigosa","affiliation":["Department of Electrical, Computer and Systems Engineering, University of Oviedo, Gijon, Spain"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/28/5393147/5166476/5166476-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["David D\u00edaz Reigosa (S'03\u2013M'07) was born in Spain in 1979.

This leads to highly distorted output waveforms. In such applications, it is necessary to filter the output waveforms using bulky passive filtering systems. The recently presented selective harmonic mitigation pulsewidth modulation (SHMPWM) technique produces output waveforms where the harmonic distortion is limited, fulfilling specific grid codes when the number of switching angles is high enough. The related technique has been previously presented using a switching frequency that is equal to 750 Hz. In this paper, a special implementation of the SHMPWM technique optimized for very low switching frequency is studied. Experimental results obtained applying SHMPWM to a three-level neutral-point-clamped converter using a switching frequency that is equal to 350 Hz are presented. The obtained results show that the SHMPWM technique improves the results of previous selective harmonic elimination pulsewidth modulation techniques for very low switching frequencies. This fact highlights that the SHMPWM technique is very useful in high-power applications, leading its use to an important reduction of the bulky and expensive filtering elements.","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2009.2026759","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/5483249/05166484.pdf","startPage":"2315","endPage":"2323","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2009.2026759","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5483249","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Selective Harmonic Mitigation Technique for High-Power Converters","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5166484","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 July 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5166484/","displayDocTitle":"Selective Harmonic Mitigation Technique for High-Power Converters","volume":"57","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 2010","accessionNumber":"11341380","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5166484/","dateOfInsertion":"10 June 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Selective Harmonic Mitigation Technique for High-Power Converters","sourcePdf":"tie-napoles-2026759.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073355S","chronDate":"July  2010","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"5483249","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"168","xplore-issue":"5483249","articleId":"5166484","onlineDate":"17 July 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5166486,"authors":[{"name":"Harini Veeraraghavan","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA","General Electric Research and Development Center, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6979/5338639/5166486/5166486-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Harini Veeraraghavan received the Ph.D. degree in computer science from the University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, in 2006.","From 2006 to 2008, she conducted postdoctoral research with Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA.

The novel sinusoidal pulsewidth modulation (PWM) pulse-rotation-control approach, for a wide range of output voltage, provides a simple way to implement vector control for IM when the cascaded NPC inverter is employed. The proposed method presents great benefits to the cascaded NPC inverter. The output voltages and power of all inverter modules and the two series-capacitor dc voltages of each inverter module are perfectly balanced. Moreover, a low switch frequency of all inverter modules supports a synthesized high-frequency PWM phase voltage. The internal voltage drop of the inverter, due to the cascade structure of many insulated-gate bipolar transistor-diode modules' series connection, is analyzed, which causes the distorted phase voltages and currents at low speeds when the frequency and the output voltage are low. The current closed-loop control compensates the distortion of phase voltages and currents. A rotor-flux-oriented vector control is combined with back-electromotive-force-based model reference adaptive system speed estimation, which results in a speed closed-loop control. The voltage sensors together with the filters of changeable parameters ensure the precision of speed estimation for the whole frequency range. The experimental tests are carried out through an 800-kW 4160-V IM drive fed by the 1-MVA 6000-V 17-level cascaded NPC inverter. The results verify the proposed scheme.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5508599","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2009.2026761","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/5508599/05166488.pdf","startPage":"2659","endPage":"2668","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2009.2026761","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Effective Control Technique for Medium-Voltage High-Power Induction Motor Fed by Cascaded Neutral-Point-Clamped Inverter","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2010","displayDocTitle":"An Effective Control Technique for Medium-Voltage High-Power Induction Motor Fed by Cascaded Neutral-Point-Clamped Inverter","volume":"57","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/5166488/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2010","accessionNumber":"11465097","dateOfInsertion":"12 July 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5166488/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 July 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Effective Control Technique for Medium-Voltage High-Power Induction Motor Fed by Cascaded Neutral-Point-Clamped Inverter","sourcePdf":"tie-ge-2026761-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.145385S","chronDate":"Aug.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"5508599","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"47","xplore-issue":"5508599","articleId":"5166488","onlineDate":"17 July 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5166493,"authors":[{"name":"Rachana Ashok Gupta","affiliation":["Advanced Diagnosis Automation and Control Laboratory Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/5379132/5166493/5166493-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Rachana Ashok Gupta received the B.Eng. degree in electronics and telecommunication from Maharashtra Institute of Technology, Pune, India, in 2002 and the M.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from North Carolina State University (NCSU), Raleigh, in 2006, where she is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering.","From 2002 to 2004, she was a Software Engineer in i-Flex Solutions Ltd., Mumbai, India.

This paper examines the practical aspects of designing and building an NC that uses the Internet as a communication medium. It focuses on finding compatible controller components that can be integrated via a host structure in a manner that makes it possible to network, in real-time, a webcam, an unmanned ground vehicle (UGV), and a remote computer server along with the necessary operator software interface. The aim is to deskill the UGV navigation process and yet maintain a robust performance. The structure of the suggested controller, its components, and the manner in which they are interfaced are described.

Initially, a simple gearbox dynamic model is used to show the effects of rotating input, output, and mesh frequency components on the electromagnetic torque and consequently on the stator current signature. By this model, the influence of transmission error, eccentricities of pinion/wheel, and teeth contact stiffness variation is demonstrated for a healthy gearbox. Then, it is shown that the electrical machine can be considered as a torque sensor through electromagnetic torque estimation for torsional vibration monitoring without any extra mechanical sensor. A test-rig based on a 5.5-kW three-phase squirrel-cage induction motor connected to a wound-rotor 4-kW induction generator via a one-stage gearbox has been used to validate the proposed method.","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2009.2026772","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/5282654/05166501.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2009.2026772","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5282654","startPage":"4689","endPage":"4699","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Torsional Vibration Effects on Induction Machine Current and Torque Signatures in Gearbox-Based Electromechanical System","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5166501","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Torsional Vibration Effects on Induction Machine Current and Torque Signatures in Gearbox-Based Electromechanical System","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5166501/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 July 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"56","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","accessionNumber":"10916336","dateOfInsertion":"09 October 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5166501/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Torsional Vibration Effects on Induction Machine Current and Torque Signatures in Gearbox-Based Electromechanical System","sourcePdf":"tie-henao-2026772.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.099142S","chronDate":"Nov.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"5282654","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"71","xplore-issue":"5282654","articleId":"5166501","onlineDate":"17 July 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-20"},{"_id":5166502,"authors":[{"name":"Georg Traxler-Samek","affiliation":["Hydro Generator Technology Center, ALSTOM Hydro (Switzerland) Limited, Birr, Switzerland","Darmstadt University of Technology, Darmstadt, Germany"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/5352216/5166502/5166502-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Georg Traxler-Samek received the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from Vienna University of Technology, Vienna, Austria, in 1996 and 2003, respectively.

The inductances are calculated with an air-gap permeance model. Contrary to similar existing approaches, the induced damper-bar voltages are computed using a numerical integration. This allows more precise results when it comes to higher harmonics.

So far, fault-diagnostic techniques proposed for stator-interturn-fault detection in DFIGs are based on analysis of stator current or vibration of generator. Results from these methods are ambiguous because they either fail to account for condition when the DFIG is operating under imbalanced load or these methods are based on experimental results alone without any theoretical basis. Our recent observations suggested that harmonics induced in the rotor circuit are very promising in detecting stator interturn faults in DFIGs. Hence, in this paper, an in-depth investigation is conducted to determine the origin of various harmonic components in rotor currents and their feasibility to detect stator interturn faults unambiguously. Detailed analysis is presented, which explains the mechanism by which the stator-interturn-fault-related harmonics are induced in the rotor circuit. The theory is verified with simulation and extensive experimental results. To confirm the feasibility of the proposed technique for detecting stator interturn faults and obtain results on speed sensitivity of fault detection, a prototype of digital-signal-processor-based fault-diagnostic system has been developed, which is capable of producing very fast trip signal in about 2 s.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIA.2009.2027406","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5247116","startPage":"1831","endPage":"1842","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/28/5247116/05166508.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Stator-Interturn-Fault Detection of Doubly Fed Induction Generators Using Rotor-Current and Search-Coil-Voltage Signature Analysis","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5166508/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.-oct.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 July 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5166508/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Stator-Interturn-Fault Detection of Doubly Fed Induction Generators Using Rotor-Current and Search-Coil-Voltage Signature Analysis","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept.-oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"10870632","dateOfInsertion":"18 September 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"45","issue":"5","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Stator-Interturn-Fault Detection of Doubly Fed Induction Generators Using Rotor-Current and Search-Coil-Voltage Signature Analysis","sourcePdf":"tia-nandi-2027406.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.125355S","chronDate":"Sept.-oct.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"28","isNumber":"5247116","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"28","citationCount":"77","xplore-issue":"5247116","articleId":"5166508","onlineDate":"17 July 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5166509,"authors":[{"name":"Nicoleta Minoiu Enache","affiliation":["LIVIC (A Research Laboratory of Advanced Driving Assistance Systems), a Joint Research Unit of LCPC (the French National Research Institute on Civil Engineering), INRETS (French National Institute on Transportation and Safety), Versailles, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6979/5420295/5166509/5166509-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Nicoleta Minoiu Enache received the M.S. degree in electrical engineering and business administration from Politehnica University of Bucharest, Bucharest, Romania, in 2002, the M.S. degree in electrical engineering and business administration from Darmstadt University of Technology, Darmstadt, Germany, in 2004, and the M.S. degree in control and signal processing from the Universit\u00e9 Paris Sud, Paris, France, in 2005.

In this paper, we examine the effects of this fading. We begin with an analysis of the frequency-selective fading caused by first-order PMD. We then estimate the impact of PMD in single-receiver DDO-OFDM using all-order simulations to generate outage probabilities as a function of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) penalty. The performances of three single-receiver DDO-OFDM formats are compared and a new format that minimizes the frequency difference between the carrier and sideband is found to be more tolerant to PMD. We then introduce a DDO-OFM system that includes polarization diversity and carrier boost in the receiver. The effects of various configurations are simulated and the results suggest that a data rate of 42.7 Gb/s can be achieved within an optical bandwidth of 40 GHz, and with negligible PMD penalties.","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2009.2016987","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/50/5153550/05166549.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2009.2016987","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5153550","startPage":"2792","endPage":"2799","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Impact of PMD in Single-Receiver and Polarization-Diverse Direct-Detection Optical OFDM","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5166549","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Impact of PMD in Single-Receiver and Polarization-Diverse Direct-Detection Optical OFDM","chronOrPublicationDate":"July15,  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5166549/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 July 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"27","issue":"14","publicationDate":"July15, 2009","accessionNumber":"10824017","dateOfInsertion":"17 July 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5166549/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Impact of PMD in Single-Receiver and Polarization-Diverse Direct-Detection Optical OFDM","sourcePdf":"jlt-schmidt-2016987.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.089348S","chronDate":"July15,  2009","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"5153550","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"5153550","articleId":"5166549","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5166550,"authors":[{"name":"Duo Chen","affiliation":["On-Chip Electromagnetics Research Group, School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/43/5166543/5166550/5166550-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Duo Chen received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electrical engineering from Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, in 2004 and 2007, respectively.

In this method, a set of orthogonal prism vector basis functions is developed. Based on this set of bases, an arbitrary 3-D multilayered system such as a combined package and die is reduced to a single-layer system with negligible computational cost. More importantly, the reduced single-layer system is diagonal and, hence, can be solved readily. From the solution of the reduced system, the solution of the other unknowns is recovered in linear complexity. The method entails no theoretical approximation. It applies to any arbitrarily shaped multilayer structure involving inhomogeneous materials or any structure that can be geometrically modeled by triangular prism elements. In addition, it permits nonlinear device modeling and broadband simulation within one run. Numerical and experimental results have demonstrated its accuracy and high capacity in simulating on-chip, package, and die-package interface problems.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 July 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5166550/","volume":"28","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/5166550/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10781269","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"17 July 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Time-Domain Orthogonal Finite-Element Reduction-Recovery Method for Electromagnetics-Based Analysis of Large-Scale Integrated Circuit and Package Problems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Time-Domain Orthogonal Finite-Element Reduction-Recovery Method for Electromagnetics-Based Analysis of Large-Scale Integrated Circuit and Package Problems","sourcePdf":"tcad-jiao-2021010.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.110679S","chronDate":"Aug.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"43","isNumber":"5166543","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"5166543","articleId":"5166550","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5166555,"authors":[{"name":"Amith Singhee","affiliation":["IBM Thomas J.

Scaling of voltage is associated with larger variations, while Vdd upscaling or transistor up-sizing for parametric-delay variation tolerance can be detrimental for power dissipation. However, for a class of signal-processing systems, effective tradeoff can be achieved between Vdd scaling, variation tolerance, and ldquooutput quality.rdquo In this paper, we develop a novel low-power variation-tolerant algorithm/architecture for color interpolation that allows a graceful degradation in the peak-signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) under aggressive voltage scaling as well as extreme process variations. This feature is achieved by exploiting the fact that all computations used in interpolating the pixel values do not equally contribute to PSNR improvement. In the presence of Vdd scaling and process variations, the architecture ensures that only the ldquoless important computationsrdquo are affected by delay failures. We also propose a different sliding-window size than the conventional one to improve interpolation performance by a factor of two with negligible overhead. Simulation results show that, even at a scaled voltage of 77% of nominal value, our design provides reasonable image PSNR with 40% power savings.","doi":"10.1109/TCAD.2009.2022197","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/43/5166543/05166620.pdf","startPage":"1127","endPage":"1137","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCAD.2009.2022197","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5166543","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design Methodology for Low Power and Parametric Robustness Through Output-Quality Modulation: Application to Color-Interpolation Filtering","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 July 2009","displayDocTitle":"Design Methodology for Low Power and Parametric Robustness Through Output-Quality Modulation: Application to Color-Interpolation Filtering","volume":"28","issue":"8","dateOfInsertion":"17 July 2009","accessionNumber":"10781258","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5166620/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5166620/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design Methodology for Low Power and Parametric Robustness Through Output-Quality Modulation: Application to Color-Interpolation Filtering","sourcePdf":"tcad-banerjee-2022197.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.062532S","chronDate":"Aug.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"43","isNumber":"5166543","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"5166543","articleId":"5166620","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5166735,"authors":[{"name":"Mohammad Mosleh","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, Islamic Azad University, Dezful, Iran"],"firstName":"Mohammad","lastName":"Mosleh","id":"37391821500"},{"name":"Saeed Setayeshi","affiliation":["Department of Nuclear Engineering, Amirkabir University of Technology\uc2a0, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Saeed","lastName":"Setayeshi","id":"37064287200"},{"name":"Mohammad Kheyrandish","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, Islamic Azad University, Dezful, Iran"],"firstName":"Mohammad","lastName":"Kheyrandish","id":"37569900900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3654-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5166735","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":348},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Acceleration","Speech recognition","Hidden Markov models","Genetic algorithms","Speech analysis","Viterbi algorithm","Signal processing algorithms","Automatic speech recognition","Speech processing","Pattern analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular automata","dynamic programming","genetic algorithms","hidden Markov models","speech recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["speech recognition algorithm","synergic hidden Markov model","genetic algorithm","cellular automata","dynamic speech signal modeling","HMM model","Viterbi algorithm","dynamic programming","recognition accuracy","recognition speed","HGCisso"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Speech recognition- Hidden Markov Model(HMM) -Genetic Algorithm (GA)-Cellular Automata (CA)"]}],"abstract":"One of the best current methods for modeling dynamic speech signal is using of HMM model.

The cellular selection of individuals is controlled based on the structure of cellular automata, to prevent the fast population diversity loss and improve the convergence performance during the genetic search.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5166772/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 May 2009","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"15-17 May 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"17 July 2009","publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10780043","htmlLink":"/document/5166772/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"The Improved Genetic Algorithm for Assingment Problems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Improved Genetic Algorithm for Assingment Problems","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"3654a187.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041198S","chronDate":"15-17 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5166727","isNumber":"5166728","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5166727","xplore-issue":"5166728","articleId":"5166772","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5166774,"authors":[{"name":"Alireza Homayounzadeh","affiliation":["Department of electrical engineering, Shiraz University, Shiraz, Iran"],"firstName":"Alireza","lastName":"Homayounzadeh","id":"37569724500"},{"name":"Mohammad Ali Masnadi Shirazi","affiliation":["Department of electrical engineering, Shiraz University, Shiraz, Iran"],"firstName":"Mohammad Ali Masnadi","lastName":"Shirazi","id":"37583571400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3654-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5166774","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":203},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","Independent component analysis","Frequency estimation","Degradation","Signal processing algorithms","Interference","OFDM modulation","Signal processing","Electrical engineering","Mean square error methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","independent component analysis","least mean squares methods","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["LMMSE channel estimation","OFDM systems","independent component analysis","carrier frequency offset","ICA-LMMSE","linear minimum mean square error"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Channel Estimation","CFO","OFDM (Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing)","ICA","LMMSE (Linear Minimum Mean Square Error)","ICI (Inter-Carrier Interference)"]}],"abstract":"In this paper the effect of CFO (carrier frequency offset) on channel estimation in OFDM systems is investigated. The LMMSE channel estimation is considered and it is shown that CFO degrades the performance of this algorithm. In addition a novel method called ICA-LMMSE is proposed. It uses ICA (independent component analysis) to find an estimate of CFO, in order to cancel out the inefficiency caused by CFO in the LMMSE channel estimation. It is shown that by applying the proposed method the MSE of the channel estimation algorithm is decreased to a high extent. The effectiveness of the method is also shown by simulation.","doi":"10.1109/ICSPS.2009.44","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Signal Processing Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Signal Processing Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5166727/5166728/05166774.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSPS.2009.44","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5166728","startPage":"196","endPage":"200","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improving Channel Estimation in OFDM Systems via Independent Component Analysis","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5166774","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Improving Channel Estimation in OFDM Systems via Independent Component Analysis","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 May 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5166774/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"15-17 May 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10780045","dateOfInsertion":"17 July 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5166774/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improving Channel Estimation in OFDM Systems via Independent Component Analysis","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"3654a196.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070551S","chronDate":"15-17 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5166727","isNumber":"5166728","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5166727","xplore-issue":"5166728","articleId":"5166774","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5166777,"authors":[{"name":"Tahereh Kahookar Toosi","affiliation":["Biomedical Engineering Department, Iran University of Science and Technology, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Tahereh Kahookar","lastName":"Toosi","id":"37569750200"},{"name":"Hamid Behnam","affiliation":["Biomedical Engineering Department, Iran University of Science and Technology, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Hamid","lastName":"Behnam","id":"37541433800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3654-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5166777","dbTime":"22 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":416},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Pulse compression methods","Array signal processing","Ultrasonic imaging","Biomedical imaging","Signal resolution","Image resolution","High-resolution imaging","Biomedical engineering","Frequency","Chirp"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","biomedical ultrasonics","image resolution","medical image processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["pulse compression","adaptive beamforming","coded excitation ultrasound medical imaging","side-lobe artifacts","SNR","image resolution"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Ultrasound medical imaging","Code excitation","Adaptive beamforming"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5166777","doi":"10.1109/ICSPS.2009.52","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Signal Processing Systems","abstract":"Coded excitation has been studied and applied to medical ultrasound for several years. The advantages of using coded excitation compared to the conventional pulses are improved SNR, minimized exposure of patients to potential biological effects, and the ability of using even higher ultrasonic frequencies. However, the major problem associated with coded excitation is the high side-lobe level which introduces the side-lobe artifacts. In this paper, we have utilized the adaptive beamforming to suppress the side-lobe effects and thus enhance the resolution in a coded excitation ultrasound imaging system. Simulation results showed that by applying minimum variance adaptive beamformer to a chirp-excited ultrasound imaging system, significant improvement in both SNR and resolution can be achieved.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSPS.2009.52","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5166728","startPage":"210","endPage":"214","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Signal Processing Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5166727/5166728/05166777.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Combined Pulse Compression and Adaptive Beamforming in Coded Excitation Ultrasound Medical Imaging","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5166777/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 May 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5166777/","displayDocTitle":"Combined Pulse Compression and Adaptive Beamforming in Coded Excitation Ultrasound Medical Imaging","conferenceDate":"15-17 May 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10789081","dateOfInsertion":"17 July 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Combined Pulse Compression and Adaptive Beamforming in Coded Excitation Ultrasound Medical Imaging","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"3654a210.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046136S","chronDate":"15-17 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5166727","isNumber":"5166728","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5166727","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5166728","articleId":"5166777","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5166783,"authors":[{"name":"K.

Hence it is essential to find the optimal transmit and receive weight vectors, to reduce MAI and to adaptively assign resources to meet the QoS requirements. In this paper, Block Diagonalization (BD) with Waterfilling power allocation is considered. This BD with Waterfilling power allocation algorithm increases the system capacity with zero MAI. In order to increase the system capacity further, BD with power and subcarrier allocation is proposed and analyzed their performance. The simulation results show that there is significant improvement in system capacity also guaranteeing zero MAI.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Signal Processing Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5166727/5166728/05166783.pdf","startPage":"239","endPage":"243","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Signal Processing Systems","doi":"10.1109/ICSPS.2009.21","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSPS.2009.21","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5166728","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5166783","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Resource Allocation with Multiuser Interference Cancellation for MIMO OFDM Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resource management","Interference cancellation","MIMO","Multiple access interference","Receiving antennas","Transmitting antennas","Adaptive systems","OFDM modulation","Intersymbol interference","Adaptive signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["interference suppression","MIMO communication","OFDM modulation","quality of service","radiofrequency interference","resource allocation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive resource allocation","multiuser interference cancellation","MIMO OFDM systems","weight vectors","QoS requirements","block diagonalization","Waterfilling power allocation","system capacity","power allocation","subcarrier allocation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MIMO systems","OFDM","multiuser channel","Waterfilling","Adaptive System"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5166783/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 May 2009","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Resource Allocation with Multiuser Interference Cancellation for MIMO OFDM Systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5166783/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10780048","dateOfInsertion":"17 July 2009","conferenceDate":"15-17 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Resource Allocation with Multiuser Interference Cancellation for MIMO OFDM Systems","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"3654a239.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047592S","chronDate":"15-17 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5166727","isNumber":"5166728","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5166727","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5166728","articleId":"5166783","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5166784,"authors":[{"name":"Sheetal U.

A novel form of frequency response expression of digital filters is deduced which is sum of sinc sum functions. One of the remarkable characteristics of the form is that weights(coefficients of terms) of window functions can be directly calculated according to the expression. An example for how to find a window function is illustrated in detail. An instance of series of window functions is tabled with both window weights and filter performances. Stopband attenuation of filters is from 32 db to 63 db with the gap about 3 db. With same performances of stopband attenuation and transition width both the order and passband ripple of filters using the new method is little better than that using Kaiser window if passband attenuation is smaller than 50 db and little worse if bigger than 52 db. The obtained window functions are as simple as Blackman window function. The outstanding feature of the new approach is that it can provide a very efficient way to find series of window functions with both good performances and easy calculation.","doi":"10.1109/ICSPS.2009.15","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSPS.2009.15","startPage":"313","endPage":"317","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Signal Processing Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Signal Processing Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5166727/5166728/05166798.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5166728","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A New Form of Frequency Response Expression of FIR Digital Filters for Directly Obtaining Window Functions","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5166798/","conferenceDate":"15-17 May 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 May 2009","displayDocTitle":"A New Form of Frequency Response Expression of FIR Digital Filters for Directly Obtaining Window Functions","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"17 July 2009","accessionNumber":"10789096","publicationDate":"May 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5166798/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A New Form of Frequency Response Expression of FIR Digital Filters for Directly Obtaining Window Functions","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"3654a313.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074919S","chronDate":"15-17 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5166727","isNumber":"5166728","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5166727","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5166728","articleId":"5166798","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5166806,"authors":[{"name":"Tae-Eung Sung","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Tae-Eung","lastName":"Sung","id":"37304611300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3654-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5166806","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":87},"abstract":"Thanks to the existing infrastructure of power line cables, power line communication (PLC) is being considered an excellent candidate for indoor/outdoor applications. The power line channel is time-varying due to the appliances that are connected to outlets since appliances often exhibit input impedance that is a function of the instantaneous amplitude of the mains voltage which, in turn, causes a periodically time varying channel response. Hence, constructing a discrete time varying block channel model in the time domain that captures the cyclostationary nature of the channel response, we propose here the overall input output relationship for power line network simulator for multiple appliances cascaded. Thereafter, we apply two types of multirate filter bank precoder schemes, weighted orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) and wavelet-based maximally decimated filter bank (MDFB), to our test channel model for error probability performance, where the model naturally allows for more realistic evaluation of modulation and coding strategies, resilient to the peculiar type of distortion encountered in this harsh medium.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Signal Processing Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5166727/5166728/05166806.pdf","startPage":"353","endPage":"357","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Signal Processing Systems","doi":"10.1109/ICSPS.2009.59","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSPS.2009.59","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5166728","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5166806","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Weighted OFDM and MDFB for Embedded PLC over Time-Varying Block Transmission","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Programmable control","Home appliances","Filter bank","Communication cables","Power line communications","Impedance","Voltage","Testing","Error probability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["carrier transmission on power lines","channel bank filters","distortion","error statistics","OFDM modulation","time-varying channels","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["OFDM","MDFB","PLC","time-varying block transmission","power line cables","power line communication","time-varying channel","power line channel","discrete time- varying block channel model","cyclostationary nature","multirate filter bank precoder schemes","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","wavelet- based maximally decimated filter bank","error probability","modulation and coding strategies"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5166806/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 May 2009","displayDocTitle":"Weighted OFDM and MDFB for Embedded PLC over Time-Varying Block Transmission","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5166806/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10780058","dateOfInsertion":"17 July 2009","conferenceDate":"15-17 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Weighted OFDM and MDFB for Embedded PLC over Time-Varying Block Transmission","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"3654a353.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077075S","chronDate":"15-17 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5166727","isNumber":"5166728","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5166727","xplore-issue":"5166728","articleId":"5166806","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5166825,"authors":[{"name":"Ashish Chauhan","affiliation":["Tata Consultancy Services Limited, Mumbai, India"],"firstName":"Ashish","lastName":"Chauhan","id":"37569252000"},{"name":"Arvind Rajawat","affiliation":["Engineering Department, MANIT College Bhopal, Bhopal, India"],"firstName":"Arvind","lastName":"Rajawat","id":"37395112700"},{"name":"Rajendra Patel","affiliation":["Engineering Department, MANIT College Bhopal, Bhopal, India"],"firstName":"Rajendra","lastName":"Patel","id":"37397728400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3654-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5166825","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":222},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Embedded system","Hardware","Microcontrollers","Microprocessors","Signal processing","Systems engineering and theory","Application software","Costs","EPROM"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["embedded systems","field programmable gate arrays","logic design","microcontrollers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FPGA reconfiguration","domain specific application","embedded system approach","high-performance hardware component design","EEPROM","8051 microcontroller"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Reconfigurable","FPGA","Microcontroller 8051","Proteus","Xilinx"]}],"abstract":"Todaypsilas systems are more complex and need higher performance. To accomplish this, systems include more hardware compared to software. This increases the use of FPGAs in modern systems because of its reconfiguration capabilities. FPGA contains many hardware components, which are utilized to perform operations directly in hardware. There are two problems related to this issue, first is high performance hardware for multiple applications need to be designed, many times these hardwares take more than one FPGA which in turn increases the system cost, even only one hardware is in use at any time. Second problem arises when operations from different domains need to be performed. There are domain specialized hardware available which deal domain specific operations efficiently, FPGAs are used in these cases also, but generally domains need to be changed after hundreds of instructions so configuring hardware for both domains simultaneously is waste of hardware resources. We have proposed a design approach that can reconfigure FPGA at its maximum speed for solving these two problems. Our proposed system can choose the appropriate architecture for domain specific application by burning corresponding configuration in the FPGA from EEPROM.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reconfiguration of FPGA for Domain Specific Applications Using Embedded System Approach","doi":"10.1109/ICSPS.2009.144","startPage":"438","endPage":"442","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSPS.2009.144","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5166728","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Signal Processing Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Signal Processing Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5166727/5166728/05166825.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5166825","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5166825/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 May 2009","displayDocTitle":"Reconfiguration of FPGA for Domain Specific Applications Using Embedded System Approach","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5166825/","dateOfInsertion":"17 July 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10789116","conferenceDate":"15-17 May 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reconfiguration of FPGA for Domain Specific Applications Using Embedded System Approach","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"3654a438.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.093707S","chronDate":"15-17 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5166727","isNumber":"5166728","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5166727","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5166728","articleId":"5166825","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5166826,"authors":[{"name":"Arash Habibi Lashkari","affiliation":["Computer Science Dept. of FCSIT, University of Malaya (UM), Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Arash Habibi","lastName":"Lashkari","id":"37570215600"},{"name":"Masood Mansoor","affiliation":["Universiti Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Wilayah Persekutuan, MY"],"firstName":"Masood","lastName":"Mansoor"},{"name":"Amir Seyed Danesh","affiliation":["Computer Science Dept. of FCSIT, University of Malaya (UM), Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Amir Seyed","lastName":"Danesh","id":"37569907800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3654-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5166826","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":20,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2701},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Privacy","Protection","Communication system security","Data security","Standards publication","Computer hacking","Monitoring","Wireless networks","Proposals","Wireless application protocol"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data privacy","telecommunication security","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wired equivalent privacy","Wi-Fi protected access","wireless network security"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["WEP","WPA","TKIP","PSK","Wireless Security. 802.11"]}],"abstract":"Wireless technology has been gaining rapid popularity for some years. Adaptation of a standard depends on the ease of use and level of security it provides. In this case, contrast between wireless usage and security standards show that the security is not keeping up with the growth paste of end userpsilas usage. Current wireless technologies in use allow hackers to monitor and even change the integrity of transmitted data. Lack of rigid security standards has caused companies to invest millions on securing their wireless networks. There are three major types of security standards in wireless. In our previous paper which was presented in ICFCC2009 Conference in Kuala Lumpur and published by IEEE Computer Society, we explained the structure of WEP as a first wireless security standard and discussed all its versions, problems and improvements. Now, we try to explain all of WPA versions and problems with the best solutions and finally make a comparison between WEP and WPA. Then we are in the next phase which is to explain the structure of last standard (WPA2) and we hope that we will publish a complete comparison among wireless security techniques in the near future and recommend a new proposal as a new protocol.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) versus Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA)","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Signal Processing Systems","doi":"10.1109/ICSPS.2009.87","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Signal Processing Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5166727/5166728/05166826.pdf","startPage":"445","endPage":"449","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSPS.2009.87","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5166728","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5166826","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5166826/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 May 2009","displayDocTitle":"Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) versus Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA)","conferenceDate":"15-17 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5166826/","dateOfInsertion":"17 July 2009","publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10789117","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) versus Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA)","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"3654a445.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.037221S","chronDate":"15-17 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5166727","isNumber":"5166728","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5166727","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"5166728","articleId":"5166826","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5166827,"authors":[{"name":"Tan Xiao-Qing","firstName":"Tan","lastName":"Xiao-Qing"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3654-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5166827","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":274},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cryptography","Virtual colonoscopy","Image reconstruction","Error correction codes","Optical polarization","Pixel","Signal processing","Mathematics","Laboratories","Information security"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["binary codes","cryptography","error correction codes","image coding","image colour analysis","light polarisation","linear codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["visual cryptography schemes","secure method","secret image","light polarisation","XOR operation","finite field","OR operation","threshold visual secret sharing schemes","binary linear error-correcting code"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["exclusive-or(XOR)","ideal contrast","binary linear error-correcting code"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5166827","abstract":"The (k, n) visual cryptography schemes (VCS) is a perfect secure method that encrypts a secret image by breaking it into shadow images.

Firstly, we show that 2 out of 2 schemes mixed on XOR and OR operation with reversing where the reconstruction of both black and white pixels is perfect.

We, first model the finite-state Markov chain (FSMC) for the physical layer service and based on that, we then characterize the Lagrangian relaxation and Dynamic programming to find the optimal shortest path.

Following the divisible load scheduling theory, an efficient load scheduling strategy is designed in large-scale networks so that the overall processing time of the sequencing tasks is minimized. In this study, the load distribution depends on the length of the sequence and number of processors in the network. Since we consider both of computation and communication overheads, the total processing time is also affected by communication link speed. Several cases have been considered in the study by varying the sequences, communication and computation speeds, and number of processors. Through simulation and numerical analysis, this study demonstrates that for a constant sequence length as the numbers of processors increase in the network the processing time for the job decreases and minimum overall processing time is achieved.","doi":"10.1109/HPCC.2009.100","publicationTitle":"2009 11th IEEE International Conference on High Performance Computing and Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 11th IEEE International Conference on High Performance Computing and Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5166953/5166954/05166985.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HPCC.2009.100","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5166954","startPage":"124","endPage":"131","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Load Scheduling Strategies for Parallel DNA Sequencing Applications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5166985","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Load Scheduling Strategies for Parallel DNA Sequencing Applications","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 June 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5166985/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"25-27 June 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10789233","dateOfInsertion":"17 July 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5166985/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Load Scheduling Strategies for Parallel DNA Sequencing Applications","confLoc":"Seoul, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"3738a124.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055867S","chronDate":"25-27 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5166953","isNumber":"5166954","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5166953","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5166954","articleId":"5166985","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":5166987,"authors":[{"name":"Hadrien Courtecuisse","affiliation":["INRIA Lille Nord Europe, France"],"firstName":"Hadrien","lastName":"Courtecuisse","id":"37569822600"},{"name":"J\u00e9r\u00e9mie Allard","affiliation":["INRIA Lille Nord Europe, France"],"firstName":"J\u00e9r\u00e9mie","lastName":"Allard","id":"37552214500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4600-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-3738-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5166987","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":22,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":633},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5166987","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Gaussian processes","High performance computing","Parallel processing","Concurrent computing","Jacobian matrices","Computer architecture","Equations","Pervasive computing","Linear systems","Europe"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["iterative methods","mathematics computing","multiprocessing systems","parallel algorithms","sparse matrices"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["parallel dense Gauss-Seidel algorithm","many-core processor","tightly-coupled constraint","sequential algorithm","fully-coupled system","synchronization primitive","multicore CPU","multicore GPU","medical intervention planning","linear complementary problem","deformable body","sparse matrix"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["parallel algorithms","linear complementary problem","GPGPU","physically based modeling"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5166954","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 11th IEEE International Conference on High Performance Computing and Communications","publicationTitle":"2009 11th IEEE International Conference on High Performance Computing and Communications","doi":"10.1109/HPCC.2009.51","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Parallel Dense Gauss-Seidel Algorithm on Many-Core Processors","startPage":"139","endPage":"147","pdfPath":"/iel5/5166953/5166954/05166987.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HPCC.2009.51","abstract":"The Gauss-Seidel method is very efficient for solving problems such as tightly-coupled constraints with possible redundancies.

This trend has also enabled the introduction of so-called flash memory SSDs (solid state disks) that have an interface identical to that of HDDs but use NAND flash memory inside as storage media. The ordinary filesystems designed for HDDs are no longer suitable for SSDs because SSDs have many different features from HDDs. We designed a hybrid filesystem, called HybridFS, that uses two kinds of storages - HDDs and SSDs. This is accomplished by distributing data into two partitions based on their type. In HybridFS, the data blocks of a large regular file are stored in a data partition in HDDs, while the metadata being stored in the partition of SSDs. Separating data into the different storages of disk partitions makes it possible to produce high I/O performance by taking appropriate I/O approach,according to the data characteristics.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5167041/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 June 2009","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"25-27 June 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"17 July 2009","publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10789282","htmlLink":"/document/5167041/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Performance Analysis of NAND Flash-Based SSD for Designing a Hybrid Filesystem","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance Analysis of NAND Flash-Based SSD for Designing a Hybrid Filesystem","confLoc":"Seoul, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"3738a539.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.036438S","chronDate":"25-27 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5166953","isNumber":"5166954","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5166953","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5166954","articleId":"5167041","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":5167049,"authors":[{"name":"Pei-Chann Chang","affiliation":["Department of Information Management, Yuan-Ze University, Taoyuan, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Pei-Chann","lastName":"Chang","id":"37573663000"},{"name":"Wei-Hsiu Huang","affiliation":["Department of Industrial Engineering and Management, Yuan-Ze University, Taoyuan, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Wei-Hsiu","lastName":"Huang","id":"37574641900"},{"name":"Ching-Jung Ting","affiliation":["Department of Industrial Engineering and Management, Yuan-Ze University, Taoyuan, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Ching-Jung","lastName":"Ting","id":"37582174900"},{"name":"Ling-Chun Wu","affiliation":["Department of Industrial Engineering and Management, Yuan-Ze University, Taoyuan, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Ling-Chun","lastName":"Wu","id":"37576651700"},{"name":"Chih-Ming Lai","affiliation":["Department of Information Management, Yuan-Ze University, Taoyuan, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chih-Ming","lastName":"Lai","id":"37575606300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4600-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-3738-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5167049","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":155},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Scheduling algorithm","Immune system","Genetic algorithms","Biological cells","Processor scheduling","Production","Organisms","High performance computing","Artificial immune systems","Resists"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["artificial immune systems","flow shop scheduling","genetic algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hybrid genetic-immune algorithm","elitist antigen","flow-shop scheduling problems","artificial immune system","coevolutional process","production scheduling"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Genetic Algorithm","Artificial Immune System","Flow-Shop Scheduling","Co-evolutionary Process"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5167049","abstract":"In this paper, a Hybrid Genetic-Immune algorithm (HGIA) is developed to solve the flow-shop scheduling problems.

In the co-evolutionary process, GA and AIS cooperate with each other to search optimal solution by searching different objective functions. One is named fitness in GA section and another one is named antigen which will evoke the withstanding of antibodies. In the process of fighting, the antibodies will evolve till they can resist the antigen. An improved survival strategy of lifespan is also proposed to extend the lifespan of the antibodies as a result the selected antibodies will stay in system longer. The hybrid of GA and AIS can simultaneously contain two objectives. Hence, larger searching space and escaping from local optimal solution will be the superiority for hybridizing GA and AIS. In the research, a set of flow-shop scheduling problems are applied for validating the efficiency. The intensive experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed approach for Flow-shop problems in Production Scheduling.","doi":"10.1109/HPCC.2009.68","startPage":"591","endPage":"596","publicationTitle":"2009 11th IEEE International Conference on High Performance Computing and Communications","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HPCC.2009.68","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5166954","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 11th IEEE International Conference on High Performance Computing and Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5166953/5166954/05167049.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Hybrid Genetic-Immune Algorithm with Improved Offsprings and Elitist Antigen for Flow-Shop Scheduling Problems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5167049/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Hybrid Genetic-Immune Algorithm with Improved Offsprings and Elitist Antigen for Flow-Shop Scheduling Problems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5167049/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10780089","publicationDate":"June 2009","dateOfInsertion":"17 July 2009","conferenceDate":"25-27 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 June 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Hybrid Genetic-Immune Algorithm with Improved Offsprings and Elitist Antigen for Flow-Shop Scheduling Problems","confLoc":"Seoul, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"3738a591.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065078S","chronDate":"25-27 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5166953","isNumber":"5166954","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5166953","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"5166954","articleId":"5167049","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5167051,"authors":[{"name":"Liang-Teh Lee","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Tatung University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Liang-Teh","lastName":"Lee","id":"37287859500"},{"name":"Ching-Wei Chen","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Tatung University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Ching-Wei","lastName":"Chen","id":"37578939300"},{"name":"Hung-Yuan Chang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Technology and Science Institute of Northern Taiwan, Taipei, Taiwan","Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Tatung University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Hung-Yuan","lastName":"Chang","id":"37293111900"},{"name":"Chih-Chieh Tang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Tatung University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chih-Chieh","lastName":"Tang","id":"37579380600"},{"name":"Kun-Chi Pan","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Tatung University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Kun-Chi","lastName":"Pan","id":"37581213400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4600-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-3738-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5167051","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":77},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5167051","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Processor scheduling","Scheduling algorithm","Distributed computing","High performance computing","Concurrent computing","Costs","Computer science","Multiprocessing systems","Computer applications","Computer networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed processing","scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["noncritical path earliest-finish algorithm","interdependent tasks","heterogeneous computing environments","homogeneous multiprocessor system","heterogeneous computing systems","noncritical tasks","parallel computing","distributed computing"]}],"doi":"10.1109/HPCC.2009.11","endPage":"608","startPage":"603","publicationTitle":"2009 11th IEEE International Conference on High Performance Computing and Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 11th IEEE International Conference on High Performance Computing and Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5166953/5166954/05167051.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HPCC.2009.11","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5166954","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Non-critical Path Earliest-Finish Algorithm for Inter-dependent Tasks in Heterogeneous Computing Environments","abstract":"In recent years, many researchers have proposed several algorithms to schedule critical tasks in a homogeneous multiprocessor system for obtaining a shorter scheduling length.

Even though shortest path routing algorithms are well established, other alternative methods may have their own advantages. One such alternative is to use a GA-based routing algorithm. Based on previous research, GA-based routing algorithm has been found to be more scalable and insensitive to variations in network topologies. However, it is also known that GA-based routing algorithm is not fast enough for real-time computation. In this paper, we proposed a coarse-grained parallel genetic algorithm for solving the shortest path routing problem with the aim to reduce its computation time. The migration scheme, which is commonly used in coarse-grained parallel genetic algorithm, is also employed in the proposed algorithm. This algorithm is developed and run on an MPI cluster. This paper studies the effect of migration on the proposed algorithm and the performance of the algorithm as compared to its serial counterpart.","doi":"10.1109/HPCC.2009.25","pdfPath":"/iel5/5166953/5166954/05167053.pdf","startPage":"615","endPage":"621","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 11th IEEE International Conference on High Performance Computing and Communications","publicationTitle":"2009 11th IEEE International Conference on High Performance Computing and Communications","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HPCC.2009.25","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5166954","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Coarse-Grained Parallel Genetic Algorithm with Migration for Shortest Path Routing Problem","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5167053/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"A Coarse-Grained Parallel Genetic Algorithm with Migration for Shortest Path Routing Problem","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"17 July 2009","accessionNumber":"10780090","publicationDate":"June 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5167053/","conferenceDate":"25-27 June 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Coarse-Grained Parallel Genetic Algorithm with Migration for Shortest Path Routing Problem","confLoc":"Seoul, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"3738a615.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05776S","chronDate":"25-27 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5166953","isNumber":"5166954","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5166953","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"5166954","articleId":"5167053","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5167096,"authors":[{"name":"Qing Yao","affiliation":["College of Informatics and Electronics, Zhejiang Science and Technology University, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Qing","lastName":"Yao","id":"37582832600"},{"name":"Zexin Guan","affiliation":["College of Informatics and Electronics, Zhejiang Science and Technology University, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Zexin","lastName":"Guan","id":"37576101700"},{"name":"Yingfeng Zhou","affiliation":["College of Informatics and Electronics, Zhejiang Science and Technology University, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Yingfeng","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37532962100"},{"name":"Jian Tang","affiliation":["China National Rice Research Institute, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Jian","lastName":"Tang","id":"37576473100"},{"name":"Yang Hu","affiliation":["China National Rice Research Institute, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Yang","lastName":"Hu","id":"37576906900"},{"name":"Baojun Yang","affiliation":["China National Rice Research Institute, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Baojun","lastName":"Yang","id":"37574955500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3655-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5167096","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":69,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1421},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Support vector machines","Diseases","Shape","Support vector machine classification","Image processing","Microorganisms","Image segmentation","Feature extraction","Crops","Neural networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["agriculture","crops","feature extraction","image colour analysis","image segmentation","object detection","support vector machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["support vector machine","rice disease detection","color texture features","image processing techniques","feature extraction","image segmentation","rice bacterial leaf blight","rice sheath blight","rice blast","shape features"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["rice diseases spots","image processing","texture features","support vector machine"]}],"abstract":"For detecting rice disease early and accurately, we presented an application of image processing techniques and Support Vector Machine (SVM) for detecting rice diseases.

However, this cognitive spectrum hole access makes the bandwidth of the cognitive radio network (CRN) formed by multiple CRs varies severely, which makes providing quality-of-service (QoS) guarantee over the CRN a very challenging task. Considering cooperative diversity with the merit of alleviating bandwidth variation, this paper proposes a cooperative scheduling algorithm for the CR in the CRN to select a relay path with the lowest packet dropping probability for packet transmissions. Under this scheme, the upper bounds of the mean packet dropping probability have been analytically derived and the corresponding admission control mechanism is further proposed. Analytical results show that the proposed scheme provides a better QoS guarantee than direct transmissions without cooperative relay for the CRN. Simulation results also confirm that traffic sources admitted into the system can absolutely meet their mean packet dropping probability requirements.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/COGART.2009.5167224","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5167203","startPage":"6","endPage":"11","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Second International Workshop on Cognitive Radio and Advanced Spectrum Management","pdfPath":"/iel5/5161963/5167203/05167224.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Providing statistical quality-of-service guarantees in cognitive radio networks with cooperation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5167224/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 May 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5167224/","displayDocTitle":"Providing statistical quality-of-service guarantees in cognitive radio networks with cooperation","conferenceDate":"18-20 May 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10791037","dateOfInsertion":"21 July 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Providing statistical quality-of-service guarantees in cognitive radio networks with cooperation","confLoc":"Aalborg, Denmark","sourcePdf":"2757.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.1029S","chronDate":"18-20 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5161963","isNumber":"5167203","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5161963","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"5167203","articleId":"5167224","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5167226,"authors":[{"name":"Marcin Filo","affiliation":["Broadband and Wireless Group, Create-Net International Research Center, Trento, Italy"],"firstName":"Marcin","lastName":"Filo","id":"37567773400"},{"name":"Akbar Hossain","affiliation":["Broadband and Wireless Group, Create-Net International Research Center, Trento, Italy"],"firstName":"Akbar","lastName":"Hossain","id":"37575086000"},{"name":"Abdur Rahim Biswas","affiliation":["Broadband and Wireless Group, Create-Net International Research Center, Trento, Italy"],"firstName":"Abdur Rahim","lastName":"Biswas","id":"37573266100"},{"name":"Radoslaw Piesiewicz","affiliation":["Broadband and Wireless Group, Create-Net International Research Center, Trento, Italy"],"firstName":"Radoslaw","lastName":"Piesiewicz","id":"37265510100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4582-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5167226","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":26,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":314},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Narrowband","Energy consumption","WiMAX","Ultra wideband technology","FCC","Receivers","Radiofrequency interference","Frequency estimation","Wireless communication","Internetworking"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","internetworking","local area networks","personal area networks","signal processing","ultra wideband communication","WiMax"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive pilot channel","radio systems","personal wireless communication systems","local wireless communication systems","cellular wireless communication systems","internetworking","cognitive radios","cognitive networks","cognitive signaling","data-aided mitigation","UWB","WIMAX"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Coexistence","CPC","Detect and Avoid","Spectrum Sensing"]}],"abstract":"With an increasing number of collocated personal, local and cellular wireless communication systems, the question of optimum coexistence and inter-networking are raised. Although some mitigation techniques, like DAA, LDC, Frequency band notching etc. are being widely studied by industries, regulation bodies and standardization authorities, none of them show good performance in terms of detection and energy consumption without having a priori knowledge about the primary system which is not usually available. Cognitive radios and networks with cognitive signaling and data-aided mitigation techniques can become then key enablers for true heterogeneous communication environment with optimal sharing of the spectrum and coexistence. Cognitive pilot channel (CPC) is a novel, recently proposed approach which could guarantee a conflict-free coexistence. In this paper we show a generic scheme to achieve better coexistence between UWB and WIMAX through enhancing existing mitigation techniques.","doi":"10.1109/COGART.2009.5167226","publicationTitle":"2009 Second International Workshop on Cognitive Radio and Advanced Spectrum Management","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Second International Workshop on Cognitive Radio and Advanced Spectrum Management","pdfPath":"/iel5/5161963/5167203/05167226.pdf","startPage":"17","endPage":"23","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/COGART.2009.5167226","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5167203","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cognitive pilot channel: Enabler for radio systems coexistence","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5167226","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 May 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5167226/","displayDocTitle":"Cognitive pilot channel: Enabler for radio systems coexistence","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10791039","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5167226/","conferenceDate":"18-20 May 2009","dateOfInsertion":"21 July 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cognitive pilot channel: Enabler for radio systems coexistence","confLoc":"Aalborg, Denmark","sourcePdf":"6893.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.100319S","chronDate":"18-20 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5161963","isNumber":"5167203","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5161963","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"5167203","articleId":"5167226","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":5167227,"authors":[{"name":"Thomas Kaiser","affiliation":["Institute of Communications Technology, Leibniz University, Hannover, Hanover, Germany"],"firstName":"Thomas","lastName":"Kaiser","id":"37269768700"},{"name":"Maria Dolores Perez-Guirao","affiliation":["Institute of Communications Technology, Leibniz University, Hannover, Hanover, Germany"],"firstName":"Maria Dolores","lastName":"Perez-Guirao","id":"38274575800"},{"name":"Andreas Wilzeck","affiliation":["Institute of Communications Technology, Leibniz University, Hannover, Hanover, Germany"],"firstName":"Andreas","lastName":"Wilzeck","id":"37294237200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4582-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5167227","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":315},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cognitive radio","Communication industry","Wireless communication","Resource management","Computational modeling","Analytical models","Telecommunication network reliability","Delay","Communication standards","Business communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","computational complexity","game theory","radio spectrum management","telecommunication standards"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","industrial wireless communication standards","radio resource management","radio resource allocation protocols","computational complexity","game theory"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cognitive radio & networks in the perspective of industrial wireless communications","doi":"10.1109/COGART.2009.5167227","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5167203","endPage":"29","publicationTitle":"2009 Second International Workshop on Cognitive Radio and Advanced Spectrum Management","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Second International Workshop on Cognitive Radio and Advanced Spectrum Management","pdfPath":"/iel5/5161963/5167203/05167227.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/COGART.2009.5167227","startPage":"24","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5167227","abstract":"Industrial wireless applications typically operate in heterogeneous network environments and require high reliability and strictly guaranteed low latency at moderate data rates. In this contribution we provide an insight into present industrial wireless communication standards and identify the challenges they will have to accomplish in order to achieve business success. We concentrate on the coexistence problem among heterogeneous collocated wireless networks, originated from the ever-increasing demand for spectrum in license exempt bands. We argue that the cognitive radio & networks paradigm has the potential to solve these problem by allowing for near real-time, efficient, and fair radio resource management. So, the next step is to concentrate on the design of flexible and agile radio resource allocation protocols capable to coordinate the conflicting spectrum interest of heterogeneous users. The comprehensive study of heterogeneous, conflicting, cognitive systems (radios or networks) demand powerful analysis and simulation tools. We present game theory as a broadly accepted analytical framework and introduce our parallel distributed simulation engine which is able to cope with the high computational complexity of such problems.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5167227/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","dateOfInsertion":"21 July 2009","accessionNumber":"10791040","htmlLink":"/document/5167227/","conferenceDate":"18-20 May 2009","displayDocTitle":"Cognitive radio & networks in the perspective of industrial wireless communications","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cognitive radio & networks in the perspective of industrial wireless communications","confLoc":"Aalborg, Denmark","sourcePdf":"6901.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057465S","chronDate":"18-20 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5161963","isNumber":"5167203","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5161963","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5167203","articleId":"5167227","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5167228,"authors":[{"name":"Carl Wijting","affiliation":["Nokia Group, Nokia Research Center, Finland"],"firstName":"Carl","lastName":"Wijting","id":"37326949000"},{"name":"Andreas Richter","affiliation":["Nokia Group, Nokia Research Center, Finland"],"firstName":"Andreas","lastName":"Richter","id":"37279120500"},{"name":"Jari Junell","affiliation":["Nokia Group, Nokia Research Center, Finland"],"firstName":"Jari","lastName":"Junell","id":"37567652900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4582-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5167228","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":76},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cognitive radio","Cognition","Frequency","White spaces","TV","Interference","Wireless LAN","IP networks","Space technology","Working environment noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","decentralized element","software radio"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On distributed functionalities for cognitive radio","doi":"10.1109/COGART.2009.5167228","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5167203","endPage":"34","publicationTitle":"2009 Second International Workshop on Cognitive Radio and Advanced Spectrum Management","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Second International Workshop on Cognitive Radio and Advanced Spectrum Management","pdfPath":"/iel5/5161963/5167203/05167228.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/COGART.2009.5167228","startPage":"30","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5167228","abstract":"This paper investigates different functionalities that are needed in cognitive radio systems.

Accuracy and speed of estimation are the key indicators to select the appropriate spectrum sensing technique. Conventional spectrum estimation techniques which are based on short time Fourier transform (STFT) suffer from familiar problems such as low frequency resolution, high variance of estimated power spectrum and high side lobes/leakages. Methods such as multitaper spectrum estimation successfully alleviate these infarctions but exact a high price in terms of complexity. On these accounts, it appears that the filter bank spectrum estimation formulated by F. Boroujeny and wavelet based spectrum estimates are the most promising and pragmatic approaches for CR applications. This article surveys and appraises available literature on various spectrum sensing techniques and discusses spectrum sensing as a key element of CR system design.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A survey on spectrum sensing techniques for cognitive radio","publicationTitle":"2009 Second International Workshop on Cognitive Radio and Advanced Spectrum Management","doi":"10.1109/COGART.2009.5167237","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Second International Workshop on Cognitive Radio and Advanced Spectrum Management","pdfPath":"/iel5/5161963/5167203/05167237.pdf","startPage":"74","endPage":"79","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/COGART.2009.5167237","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5167203","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5167237","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5167237/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 May 2009","displayDocTitle":"A survey on spectrum sensing techniques for cognitive radio","conferenceDate":"18-20 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5167237/","dateOfInsertion":"21 July 2009","publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10791050","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A survey on spectrum sensing techniques for cognitive radio","confLoc":"Aalborg, Denmark","sourcePdf":"3783.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.146447S","chronDate":"18-20 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5161963","isNumber":"5167203","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5161963","citationCount":"92","xplore-issue":"5167203","articleId":"5167237","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5167238,"authors":[{"name":"Rizwan Akhtar","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, College of Signals, National University of Science and Technology, Pakistan"],"firstName":"Rizwan","lastName":"Akhtar","id":"37568181200"},{"name":"Adnan Rashdi","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, College of Signals, National University of Science and Technology, Pakistan"],"firstName":"Adnan","lastName":"Rashdi","id":"37424793800"},{"name":"Abdul Ghafoor","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, College of Signals, National University of Science and Technology, Pakistan"],"firstName":"Abdul","lastName":"Ghafoor","id":"37287131200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4582-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5167238","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":347},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cognitive radio","Chromium","Interference","Cascading style sheets","Software radio","Radio transmitters","TV","Matched filters","Filtering","Computer vision"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","diversity reception","radio spectrum management","radiofrequency interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["grouping technique","cooperative spectrum sensing","cognitive radio network","radiofrequency interference","cooperative diversity","group-based spectrum sensing","tasking mechanism","spectrum scarcity problem"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cognitive radio","software defined radio","spectrum sensing","cooperative spectrum sensing"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5167238","doi":"10.1109/COGART.2009.5167238","publicationTitle":"2009 Second International Workshop on Cognitive Radio and Advanced Spectrum Management","abstract":"Cognitive networks can potentially solve the problems of spectrum scarcity by accommodating unlicensed (secondary) users in under-utilized segments of the spectrum.

Cognitive radio networks offer a promising realization of this novel paradigm, thanks to their ability to autonomously identify the white spaces through spectrum sensing. Implementation of such networks, however, requires a model translating the regulatory constraint on the aggregate interference to the system- and device-level design parameters. In this paper a statistical model of interference aggregation in spectrum-sensing cognitive radio networks is developed. In particular, distribution of the aggregate interference is characterized in terms of parameters such as sensitivity, transmitted power, and density of the cognitive radios as well as the underlying propagation environment. The model is further extended to account for the effect of cooperative spectrum sensing on the distribution of the aggregate interference.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/COGART.2009.5167239","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5167203","startPage":"86","endPage":"90","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Second International Workshop on Cognitive Radio and Advanced Spectrum Management","pdfPath":"/iel5/5161963/5167203/05167239.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Interference aggregation and sensing in cognitive radio networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5167239/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 May 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5167239/","displayDocTitle":"Interference aggregation and sensing in cognitive radio networks","conferenceDate":"18-20 May 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10791052","dateOfInsertion":"21 July 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Interference aggregation and sensing in cognitive radio networks","confLoc":"Aalborg, Denmark","sourcePdf":"0887.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058862S","chronDate":"18-20 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5161963","isNumber":"5167203","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5161963","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5167203","articleId":"5167239","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5167242,"authors":[{"name":"Alireza Attar","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada"],"firstName":"Alireza","lastName":"Attar","id":"37391694100"},{"name":"Oliver Holland","affiliation":["Centre for Telecommunications Research, King''s College, London, UK"],"firstName":"Oliver","lastName":"Holland","id":"37284761300"},{"name":"A.

The aim of this paper is to address the ultra wide-band spectrum sensing, i.e. to detect the existence of spectral holes in ultra-wide frequency bands in order to improve the spectrum utilization and minimize the interference to the primary communications. Because of channel fading, the detection by one cognitive radio (CR) receiver is subject to missed detection, therefore it is instrumental for a network of spatially diverse CRs to collaborate during the spectrum sensing. In this paper, the collaborative detection is performed and the decentralized decision is discussed. A new paradigm for the decentralized decision based on bootstrap sampling in the spatio-frequency domain is presented.

SWR signal, therefore, is composed of different standard's signals and this combination leads to high temporal fluctuations and thus SWR signal inherits high peak to average power ratio (PAPR). Non-linear analogue components (amplifiers, converters etc.) cause distortions for high PAPR signals which result in system performance degradation. Usually PAPR problem is addressed in time domain while this paper presents frequency domain interpretation of PAPR which is more appropriate in CR dynamic spectrum access context. A new PAPR formulation is presented which depends only upon spectral values of the signal thus associates spectrum with PAPR. As a result this vision assists in spectrum access for CR systems by providing PAPR metric information related to any available bandwidth.

The assumed primary system is the wireless LAN (WLAN) operated with the protocol of IEEE 802.11 distributed coordination function (DCF). In such spectrum sharing system, it is required that the primary system is protected from the signals of the secondary system. In this paper, in order to keep the communication of the primary systems over the existence of the secondary systems, we propose a modified novel secondary MAC protocol, which can flexibly share the spectrum between WLAN and the secondary system. The proposed secondary MAC protocol of the packet transmission controls the packet transmission by the permission probability according to the primary system channel occupation ratio. The proposed method can keep the communication chance of the primary system without any change of the primary MAC protocol.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/COGART.2009.5167250","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5167203","startPage":"143","endPage":"147","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Second International Workshop on Cognitive Radio and Advanced Spectrum Management","pdfPath":"/iel5/5161963/5167203/05167250.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Wireless LAN protected distributed cognitive MAC protocol for secondary system","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5167250/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 May 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5167250/","displayDocTitle":"Wireless LAN protected distributed cognitive MAC protocol for secondary system","conferenceDate":"18-20 May 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10791063","dateOfInsertion":"21 July 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wireless LAN protected distributed cognitive MAC protocol for secondary system","confLoc":"Aalborg, Denmark","sourcePdf":"3123.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040231S","chronDate":"18-20 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5161963","isNumber":"5167203","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5161963","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5167203","articleId":"5167250","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5167251,"authors":[{"name":"Nikhil Kundargi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Minnesota, Twin city, USA"],"firstName":"Nikhil","lastName":"Kundargi","id":"37391469700"},{"name":"Ahmed Tewfik","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Minnesota, Twin city, USA"],"firstName":"Ahmed","lastName":"Tewfik","id":"37271583200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4582-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5167251","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":95},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Media Access Protocol","Cognitive radio","Interference","Temperature sensors","Error analysis","TV","Wireless LAN","Physical layer","Frequency","Wireless networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","electromagnetic wave interference","radio networks","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["medium access control","cognitive radio network","spectrum sensing","physical layer","frequency band","primary transmission","packet error rate","distributed estimation","IEEE 802.11 wireless network","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Wireless LAN","Distributed Estimation"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sensing of transmission opportunities at the Medium Access Control layer for cognitive radio networks","doi":"10.1109/COGART.2009.5167251","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5167203","endPage":"152","publicationTitle":"2009 Second International Workshop on Cognitive Radio and Advanced Spectrum Management","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Second International Workshop on Cognitive Radio and Advanced Spectrum Management","pdfPath":"/iel5/5161963/5167203/05167251.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/COGART.2009.5167251","startPage":"148","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5167251","abstract":"Detection of transmission opportunities is the critical part of establishing a cognitive radio network. Traditionally, it is achieved via spectrum sensing carried out at the physical layer to detect unused frequency bands. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to detect transmission opportunities at the Medium Access Control (MAC) layer based on the concept of interference temperature. In this approach, secondary transmissions are overlayed on top of primary transmissions as long as they do not affect the primary transmission. A Transmit Margin is defined and used to quantify the spare capacity in the primary network. We setup a system to estimate and track the Packet Error Rates (PER) and use it as a metric for transmit opportunity detection. A distributed estimation procedure to increase the robustness of the estimate is also proposed for cognitive radio networks. The scope of this hitherto unexplored area of cognitive radios is demonstrated and applied to IEEE 802.11 wireless networks through simulation studies.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5167251/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","dateOfInsertion":"21 July 2009","accessionNumber":"10791064","htmlLink":"/document/5167251/","conferenceDate":"18-20 May 2009","displayDocTitle":"Sensing of transmission opportunities at the Medium Access Control layer for cognitive radio networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sensing of transmission opportunities at the Medium Access Control layer for cognitive radio networks","confLoc":"Aalborg, Denmark","sourcePdf":"4812.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046341S","chronDate":"18-20 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5161963","isNumber":"5167203","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5161963","xplore-issue":"5167203","articleId":"5167251","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5167252,"authors":[{"name":"Isameldin Suliman","affiliation":["Centre for Wireless Communications, University of Oulu, Oulu, Finland"],"firstName":"Isameldin","lastName":"Suliman","id":"37403428100"},{"name":"Janne Lehtomaki","affiliation":["Centre for Wireless Communications, University of Oulu, Oulu, Finland"],"firstName":"Janne","lastName":"Lehtomaki","id":"38539864000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4582-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5167252","dbTime":"20 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":40,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":555},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Queueing analysis","Cognitive radio","Interference","Performance analysis","Telecommunication traffic","Traffic control","Wireless networks","Wireless communication","Resource management","Steady-state"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","frequency allocation","queueing theory","telecommunication traffic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["opportunistic access","cognitive radio","licensed user","secondary user transmission","time slotted system","spectrum sensing","primary user communication","M/D/1 priority queueing scheme","data traffic","queue utilization factor"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Queueing analysis of opportunistic access in cognitive radios","doi":"10.1109/COGART.2009.5167252","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5167203","endPage":"157","publicationTitle":"2009 Second International Workshop on Cognitive Radio and Advanced Spectrum Management","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Second International Workshop on Cognitive Radio and Advanced Spectrum Management","pdfPath":"/iel5/5161963/5167203/05167252.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/COGART.2009.5167252","startPage":"153","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5167252","abstract":"This paper presents queueing analysis of opportunistic access in cognitive radios. The primary (licensed user) has priority over the secondary user and it does not need to care about the secondary user transmissions. A time slotted system is assumed, so that the secondary user can perform spectrum sensing at the beginning of the slot to know if it is occupied by primary or not. If the slot is free, it can be utilized for secondary transmissions. This leads to no interference with primary user communication, assuming perfect sensing. Finding waiting time and queue length of this type of system has not, according to our best knowledge, been performed before. We perform theoretical analysis by applying M/D/1 priority queueing scheme. The results were used to evaluate the performance of the cognitive network. Simulation are used to validate the results, and simulation results demonstrate a high degree of accuracy for the derived expressions. Results indicate that the performance of the secondary user depends on the data traffic characteristics of the primary user, and under high arrival rate for the primary, the average waiting and average queueing length of the secondary user grow especially when the combined arrival rate approach the queue utilization factor.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5167252/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","dateOfInsertion":"21 July 2009","accessionNumber":"10791065","htmlLink":"/document/5167252/","conferenceDate":"18-20 May 2009","displayDocTitle":"Queueing analysis of opportunistic access in cognitive radios","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Queueing analysis of opportunistic access in cognitive radios","confLoc":"Aalborg, Denmark","sourcePdf":"6187.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044164S","chronDate":"18-20 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5161963","isNumber":"5167203","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5161963","citationCount":"40","xplore-issue":"5167203","articleId":"5167252","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5167290,"authors":[{"name":"Xavier Amatriain","affiliation":["University of California, Santa Barbara, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Xavier Amatriain works at the Telefonica research center in Barcelona, Spain, and is associate professor at the Universitat Pompeu Fabra in Barcelona.

However, the conventional CS adopts a non-discriminated sampling scheme which usually gives poor performance on realistic complex signals. In this paper we propose a reweighted Compressive Sampling for image compression. It introduces a weighting scheme into the conventional CS framework whose coefficients are determined in encoding side according to the statistics of image signals. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method notably outperforms the conventional Compressive Sampling framework in coding performance in the sense that the reconstruction quality is greatly enhanced with same number of measurements and computational complexity.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image coding","Image sampling","Image reconstruction","Data compression","Signal sampling","Sampling methods","Time measurement","Statistics","Iterative decoding","Signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","data compression","image coding","image enhancement","image reconstruction","image sampling","statistical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["reweighted compressive sampling","image compression","data compression","encoding","image signal statistics","reconstruction quality enhancement","computational complexity"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Compressive Sampling","natural image statistics","reweighted sampling","sparsity","l1 minimization"]}],"doi":"10.1109/PCS.2009.5167354","publicationTitle":"2009 Picture Coding Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Picture Coding Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/5160797/5167340/05167354.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5167340","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PCS.2009.5167354","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reweighted Compressive Sampling for image compression","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5167354","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Reweighted Compressive Sampling for image compression","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5167354/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5167354/","accessionNumber":"10790859","conferenceDate":"6-8 May 2009","dateOfInsertion":"21 July 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 May 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reweighted Compressive Sampling for image compression","confLoc":"Chicago, IL, USA","sourcePdf":"114.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052019S","chronDate":"6-8 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5160797","isNumber":"5167340","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5160797","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"5167340","articleId":"5167354","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":5167374,"authors":[{"name":"Rong Zhang","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA"],"firstName":"Rong","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37575290300"},{"name":"Mary L.

Close to %45 of this computation belongs to Fractional Motion Estimation (FME) which has to perform a time consuming half-pixel and quarter-pixel interpolation. In addition, interpolation is a major challenge for hardware implementation in real time, specially in mobile applications where processing and battery power is limited. Several modified sub-pixel accuracy search methods have been proposed in the literature in order to reduce the complexity of interpolation. The reciprocal method has been proposed to reduce the CPU encoding time for a software implementation of an H.264 encoder on personal computers. In this paper, the hardware implementation of the reciprocal method is evaluated and its PSNR performance and hardware cost are compared to that of a simplified Rate-Distortion Optimization (RDO) process. Simulation results indicate that using reciprocal FME with enabled RDO has less computational cost and better PSNR performance than using the conventional FME with disabled RDO.","doi":"10.1109/PCS.2009.5167382","publicationTitle":"2009 Picture Coding Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Picture Coding Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/5160797/5167340/05167382.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PCS.2009.5167382","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5167340","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low complexity hardware implementation of reciprocal fractional motion estimation for H.264/AVC in mobile applications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5167382","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 May 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5167382/","displayDocTitle":"Low complexity hardware implementation of reciprocal fractional motion estimation for H.264/AVC in mobile applications","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10790887","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5167382/","conferenceDate":"6-8 May 2009","dateOfInsertion":"21 July 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low complexity hardware implementation of reciprocal fractional motion estimation for H.264/AVC in mobile applications","confLoc":"Chicago, IL, USA","sourcePdf":"141.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064349S","chronDate":"6-8 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5160797","isNumber":"5167340","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5160797","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5167340","articleId":"5167382","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":5167395,"authors":[{"name":"Iva Bogdanova","affiliation":["Ecole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne (EPFL), Institute of Microengineering (IMT), Pattern Recognition Laboratory (PARLAB), Neuchatel, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Iva","lastName":"Bogdanova","id":"37567821900"},{"name":"Alexandre Bur","affiliation":["Ecole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne (EPFL), Institute of Microengineering (IMT), Pattern Recognition Laboratory (PARLAB), Neuchatel, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Alexandre","lastName":"Bur","id":"37584271800"},{"name":"Pierre-Andre Farine","affiliation":["Ecole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne (EPFL), Institute of Microengineering (IMT), Pattern Recognition Laboratory (PARLAB), Neuchatel, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Pierre-Andre","lastName":"Farine","id":"37396003100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4593-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4594-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5167395","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":117},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Video sequences","Solid modeling","Geometry","Application software","Computer vision","Motion detection","Feature extraction","Pattern recognition","Laboratories","Motion estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational geometry","image matching","image motion analysis","image sequences","video signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dynamic attentive system","omnidirectional video sequence","computer modeling","multiscale contrast detection","spherical motion field pyramid","static saliency map","spherical geometry","block matching algorithm","consecutive omnidirectional image","dynamic visual attention","motion saliency map","spherical dynamic saliency map"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["dynamic visual attention","block matching on the sphere","omnidirectional image processing"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we propose a dynamic attentive system for detecting the most salient regions of interest in omnidirectional video. The spot selection is based on computer modeling of dynamic visual attention. In order to operate on video sequences, the process encompasses the multiscale contrast detection of static and motion information, as well as fusion of the information in a scalar map called saliency map. The processing is performed in spherical geometry. While the static contribution collected in the static saliency map relies on our previous work, we propose a novel motion model based on block matching algorithm computed on the sphere. A spherical motion field pyramid is first estimated from two consecutive omnidirectional images by varying the block size. This latter constitutes the input of the motion model. Then, the motion saliency map is obtained by applying a multiscale motion contrast detection method in order to highlight the most salient motion regions. Finally, both static and motion saliency maps are integrated into a spherical dynamic saliency map. To illustrate the concept, the proposed attentive system is applied to real omnidirectional video sequences.","doi":"10.1109/PCS.2009.5167395","publicationTitle":"2009 Picture Coding Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Picture Coding Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/5160797/5167340/05167395.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PCS.2009.5167395","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5167340","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamic attentive system for omnidirectional video","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5167395","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 May 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5167395/","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic attentive system for omnidirectional video","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10790900","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5167395/","conferenceDate":"6-8 May 2009","dateOfInsertion":"21 July 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic attentive system for omnidirectional video","confLoc":"Chicago, IL, USA","sourcePdf":"156.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.080739S","chronDate":"6-8 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5160797","isNumber":"5167340","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5160797","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5167340","articleId":"5167395","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5167430,"authors":[{"name":"Shohei Matsuo","affiliation":["NTT Cyber Space Laboratories, NTT Corporation, Yokosuka, Kanagawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Shohei","lastName":"Matsuo","id":"37573330500"},{"name":"Seishi Takamura","affiliation":["NTT Cyber Space Laboratories, NTT Corporation, Yokosuka, Kanagawa, Japan"],"lastName":"Seishi Takamura","id":"37298900300"},{"name":"Yoshiyuki Yashima","affiliation":["NTT Cyber Space Laboratories, NTT Corporation, Yokosuka, Kanagawa, Japan"],"lastName":"Yoshiyuki Yashima","id":"37270791000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4593-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4594-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5167430","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":10,"totalDownloads":403},"abstract":"This paper proposes an improved intra prediction method for H.264/AVC. The conventional method uses only adjoining pixels as reference pixels. The residual energy is increased if the decoded pixels are occluded, which would result in low coding efficiency. In addition, the conventional prediction method copies the same weighted prediction value to several of the pixels lying in the prediction direction. However, if the original image exhibits gradations, the residual energy might be increased which would also result in low coding efficiency. To handle these problems, we proposed, separately, two improved methods. One allows the use of distant pixels as well as adjoining pixels. The other generates prediction signals with a spatial gradient. This paper confirms the performance of the combination of the two methods. Simulation results show that the combined method outperforms the proposed methods, in isolation, at high bit-rates.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Picture Coding Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/5160797/5167340/05167430.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","publicationTitle":"2009 Picture Coding Symposium","doi":"10.1109/PCS.2009.5167430","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PCS.2009.5167430","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5167340","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5167430","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Intra prediction with spatial gradients and multiple reference lines","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Automatic voltage control","Image coding","Prediction methods","Signal generators","Video coding","MPEG 4 Standard","Encoding","Laboratories","Decoding","Communication standards"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code standards","gradient methods","prediction theory","video coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["intra prediction method","spatial gradients","multiple reference lines","H.264-AVC standard","residual energy","pixel decoding","coding efficiency","distant pixel","adjoining pixel"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["H.264/AVC","intra prediction","spatial gradients","multiple reference lines","gradation","occlusion"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5167430/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 May 2009","displayDocTitle":"Intra prediction with spatial gradients and multiple reference lines","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5167430/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10790935","dateOfInsertion":"21 July 2009","conferenceDate":"6-8 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Intra prediction with spatial gradients and multiple reference lines","confLoc":"Chicago, IL, USA","sourcePdf":"52.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042623S","chronDate":"6-8 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5160797","isNumber":"5167340","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5160797","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"5167340","articleId":"5167430","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5167431,"authors":[{"name":"Josep Prades-Nebot","affiliation":["GTS, Universidad Polit\u00e9cnica de Valencia, Valencia, Spain"],"firstName":"Josep","lastName":"Prades-Nebot","id":"38275973400"},{"name":"Yi Ma","affiliation":["IFP, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, USA"],"lastName":"Yi Ma","id":"37274225400"},{"name":"Thomas Huang","affiliation":["IFP, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, USA"],"firstName":"Thomas","lastName":"Huang","id":"37275421800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4593-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4594-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5167431","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":74,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":695},"abstract":"In this paper, we propose a new Distributed Video Coding (DVC) algorithm based on compressive sampling principles.

From a relatively small number of random measurements, a high-dimensional signal can be recovered if it has a sparse or near-sparse representation in a basis known to the decoder. In this paper, we consider the application of CS to video signals in order to lessen the sensing and compression burdens in single- and multi-camera imaging systems. In standard video compression, motion compensation and estimation techniques have led to improved sparse representations that are more easily compressible; we adapt these techniques for the problem of CS recovery. Using a coarse-to-fine reconstruction algorithm, we alternate between the tasks of motion estimation and motion-compensated wavelet-domain signal recovery. We demonstrate that our algorithm allows the recovery of video sequences from fewer measurements than either frame-by-frame or inter-frame difference recovery methods.","doi":"10.1109/PCS.2009.5167440","publicationTitle":"2009 Picture Coding Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Picture Coding Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/5160797/5167340/05167440.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PCS.2009.5167440","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5167340","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A multiscale framework for Compressive Sensing of video","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5167440","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A multiscale framework for Compressive Sensing of video","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 May 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5167440/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"6-8 May 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10790944","dateOfInsertion":"21 July 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5167440/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A multiscale framework for Compressive Sensing of video","confLoc":"Chicago, IL, USA","sourcePdf":"62.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.113546S","chronDate":"6-8 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5160797","isNumber":"5167340","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5160797","citationCount":"62","xplore-issue":"5167340","articleId":"5167440","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5167444,"authors":[{"name":"Daniela Radakovic","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Illinois, Chicago, Chicago, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Daniela","lastName":"Radakovic","id":"38193848600"},{"name":"Rashid Ansari","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Illinois, Chicago, Chicago, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Rashid","lastName":"Ansari","id":"37273435000"},{"name":"Yingwei Yao","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Illinois, Chicago, Chicago, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Yingwei","lastName":"Yao","id":"37275325800"},{"name":"Ramakrishna Yellapantula","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Illinois, Chicago, Chicago, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Ramakrishna","lastName":"Yellapantula","id":"37352817000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4593-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4594-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5167444","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":101},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Static VAr compensators","MIMO","Bit error rate","Optimization methods","Communication system control","Wireless networks","Video coding","State feedback","Sorting","Automatic voltage control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO communication","state feedback","video coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["priority-aware transfer","encoded video","MIMO communication system","cross-layer method","video transmission quality","wireless networks","scalable video coding","multiple input multiple output transmission","channel state feedback","content-based partitioning","H.264/AVC","antenna selection","bit stream prioritization matrix","bit error rate"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cross-layer design","multi-input multi-output (MIMO)","scalable video coding (SVC)"]}],"abstract":"A cross-layer method is proposed for optimizing, controlling and improving the quality of video transmission over wireless networks using scalable video coding (SVC) and multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) transmission with channel state feedback (CSI). Multiple video sub-streams are created by a content-based partitioning and sorting of the enhancement layers produced with the SVC extension of H.264/AVC. Unlike in existing methods, the prioritized bit-streams are transmitted by actively performing power adjustment and antenna selection using a bit-stream prioritization matrix to modify the power allocation procedure of a recently proposed MIMO scheme. The power allocation strategy results in different bit error rate (BER) experienced by the bit-streams.

Solution based on using only I-frames to support view switching would incur high transmission cost, while for that based on using only P-frames to encode every possible traversal, although it can minimize transmission cost, prohibitive server's storage may be required. Therefore, efficient solutions for IMVS need to consider the trade-off between transmission and storage cost. In this paper, we study the potential use of distributed source coding (DSC) in IMVS. Specifically, we propose two DSC constructions that could achieve good transmission-storage trade-offs. Central to these constructions is a method that can efficiently encode the least significant bits (LSB) of a frame to be decoded, leading to competitive storage and transmission requirements. Experiment results demonstrate these constructions compare favorably to existing tools, and could be valuable for interactive multiview streaming.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Picture Coding Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/5160797/5167340/05167460.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","publicationTitle":"2009 Picture Coding Symposium","doi":"10.1109/PCS.2009.5167460","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PCS.2009.5167460","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5167340","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5167460","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed source coding techniques for interactive multiview video streaming","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Source coding","Streaming media","Costs","Decoding","Switches","Image reconstruction","Batteries","Video compression","Encoding","Laboratories"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["interactive video","multimedia communication","multimedia servers","source coding","video coding","video streaming"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed source coding","interactive multiview video streaming","successive video frames","interactive multiview streaming"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Multiview Video Streaming","Distributed Source Coding","Slepian-Wolf","Wyner-Ziv","SP-frames"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5167460/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 May 2009","displayDocTitle":"Distributed source coding techniques for interactive multiview video streaming","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5167460/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10790964","dateOfInsertion":"21 July 2009","conferenceDate":"6-8 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed source coding techniques for interactive multiview video streaming","confLoc":"Chicago, IL, USA","sourcePdf":"83.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06997S","chronDate":"6-8 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5160797","isNumber":"5167340","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5160797","citationCount":"39","xplore-issue":"5167340","articleId":"5167460","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5167468,"authors":[{"name":"Yuichi Tanaka","affiliation":["Department of Information Science, Utsunomiya University, Utsunomiya, Tochigi, Japan"],"firstName":"Yuichi","lastName":"Tanaka","id":"37396738600"},{"name":"Madoka Hasegawa","affiliation":["Department of Information Science, Utsunomiya University, Utsunomiya, Tochigi, Japan"],"lastName":"Madoka Hasegawa","id":"37361342800"},{"name":"Shigeo Kato","affiliation":["Department of Information Science, Utsunomiya University, Utsunomiya, Tochigi, Japan"],"lastName":"Shigeo Kato","id":"37366544300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4593-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4594-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5167468","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":135},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wavelet transforms","Image coding","Filter bank","Image reconstruction","Computational efficiency","Energy resolution","Image resolution","Information science","Video compression","Noise reduction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discrete wavelet transforms","filtering theory","image coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["highpass-filtering theory","adaptive directional wavelet transform","image coding"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Adaptive directional wavelet transform","wavelet transform","directional filter bank","image coding"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, a calculation method of transform directions for adaptive directional wavelet transform (AD WT) is proposed.

The design procedure and validation of OFDM system and feedforward linearizer have been carried out by Agilent-ADS. In order to evaluate the performance of the feedforward linearizer, sweeping back-off power has been used. Adjacent channel power ratio (ACPR) levels versus back-off power results are investigated to evaluate the performance of the linearization technique. Efficiency improvement is figured out by investigating the power added efficiency (PAE) versus back-off power. Simulation results have been shown that ACPR improvements were acceptable for OFDM system when the PA is utilized together with feedforward linearizer.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reducing the intermodulation distortion in OFDM systems by feedforward linearization technique","publicationTitle":"IEEE EUROCON 2009","doi":"10.1109/EURCON.2009.5167603","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE EUROCON 2009","pdfPath":"/iel5/5159343/5167592/05167603.pdf","startPage":"52","endPage":"56","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EURCON.2009.5167603","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5167592","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5167603","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5167603/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-23 May 2009","displayDocTitle":"Reducing the intermodulation distortion in OFDM systems by feedforward linearization technique","conferenceDate":"18-23 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5167603/","dateOfInsertion":"21 July 2009","publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10791102","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reducing the intermodulation distortion in OFDM systems by feedforward linearization technique","confLoc":"St. Petersburg, Russia","sourcePdf":"1=004=052=PID919823.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059148S","chronDate":"18-23 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5159343","isNumber":"5167592","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5159343","xplore-issue":"5167592","articleId":"5167603","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5167611,"authors":[{"name":"Bahare Nazari","firstName":"Bahare","lastName":"Nazari","id":"37567777400"},{"name":"Seyed M.

The proposed technique is based on singular value decomposition (SVD) which is in time domain and separates the signal and noise subspaces. Genetic algorithm is used for optimizing the SVD method. It is a random technique based on natural evolution. In this approach, genetic algorithm estimates the initial parameters needed for SVD in order to enhance a speech signal. The basic algorithm is developed using white noise, but we have shown that it can easily be extended to the case of colored noise using some prewhitening techniques. The experimental results indicate that the presented algorithm improves SNR considerably.","doi":"10.1109/EURCON.2009.5167611","startPage":"102","endPage":"107","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE EUROCON 2009","pdfPath":"/iel5/5159343/5167592/05167611.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE EUROCON 2009","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EURCON.2009.5167611","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5167592","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A method for noise reduction in speech signal based on singular value decomposition and genetic algorithm","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Noise reduction","Speech enhancement","Singular value decomposition","Genetic algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","signal denoising","singular value decomposition","speech processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["noise reduction method","speech signal","singular value decomposition","genetic algorithm","SVD","random technique","natural evolution","prewhitening techniques"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Singular Value Decomposition","Genetic Algorithm","noise reduction","speech enhancement"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5167611/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-23 May 2009","displayDocTitle":"A method for noise reduction in speech signal based on singular value decomposition and genetic algorithm","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5167611/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","dateOfInsertion":"21 July 2009","conferenceDate":"18-23 May 2009","accessionNumber":"10791110","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A method for noise reduction in speech signal based on singular value decomposition and genetic algorithm","confLoc":"St. Petersburg, Russia","sourcePdf":"1=004=102=PID919874.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053009S","chronDate":"18-23 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5159343","isNumber":"5167592","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5159343","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5167592","articleId":"5167611","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5167621,"authors":[{"name":"Wjatscheslaw Galjan","affiliation":["Institute of Nanoelectronics, Hamburg University of Technology, Hamburg, Germany"],"firstName":"Wjatscheslaw","lastName":"Galjan","id":"37398760100"},{"name":"Kristian M.

The acceleration produces a 26times total speed-up against a 4times overhead in area.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE EUROCON 2009","pdfPath":"/iel5/5159343/5167592/05167664.pdf","startPage":"411","endPage":"415","publicationTitle":"IEEE EUROCON 2009","doi":"10.1109/EURCON.2009.5167664","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EURCON.2009.5167664","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5167592","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5167664","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Implementation of W-CDMA cell search on a runtime reconfigurable coarse-grain array","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiaccess communication","Runtime","Reduced instruction set computing","Computer architecture","Wireless LAN","Reconfigurable architectures","Kernel","Software radio","Application software","Dairy products"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","protocols","software radio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["W-CDMA","reconfigurable coarse-grain array","computational kernel","software defined radio","radio protocols","cell search"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Reconfigurable Architecture","Software Defined Radio","Radio Protocols"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5167664/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-23 May 2009","displayDocTitle":"Implementation of W-CDMA cell search on a runtime reconfigurable coarse-grain array","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5167664/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10791162","dateOfInsertion":"21 July 2009","conferenceDate":"18-23 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Implementation of W-CDMA cell search on a runtime reconfigurable coarse-grain array","confLoc":"St. Petersburg, Russia","sourcePdf":"1=004=411=PID920891.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064401S","chronDate":"18-23 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5159343","isNumber":"5167592","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5159343","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5167592","articleId":"5167664","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5167670,"authors":[{"name":"H.

The sequence to be analyzed is first segmented into scenes according to audio similarity. Some global clues such as loudness, the ratio of unrelated shots, and the affective relationship between the scenes and the whole sequence are employed to compute the semantic scene importance. The shots in each scene are grouped based on the luminance histograms, and the semantic shot importance is then calculated using selected audio and video features. Subsequently, key frames are extracted according to the semantic frame importance computed based on certain visual features, such as attention region and motion information. This approach is effective to generate a representative video summary whilst avoiding some disadvantages of the traditional video summarization methods. Experimental results demonstrate promising performance of the proposed approach.","doi":"10.1109/EURCON.2009.5167816","pdfPath":"/iel5/5159343/5167592/05167816.pdf","startPage":"1358","endPage":"1363","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE EUROCON 2009","publicationTitle":"IEEE EUROCON 2009","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EURCON.2009.5167816","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5167592","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Semantic audiovisual analysis for video summarization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5167816/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-23 May 2009","displayDocTitle":"Semantic audiovisual analysis for video summarization","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"21 July 2009","accessionNumber":"10791309","publicationDate":"May 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5167816/","conferenceDate":"18-23 May 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Semantic audiovisual analysis for video summarization","confLoc":"St. Petersburg, Russia","sourcePdf":"3=004=354=PID930577.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.082751S","chronDate":"18-23 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5159343","isNumber":"5167592","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5159343","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5167592","articleId":"5167816","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5167817,"authors":[{"name":"Felix Albu","affiliation":["University Politehnica of Bucharest, Romania"],"bio":{"p":["Felix Albu received the M.S. degree in applied electronics from University Politehnica of Bucharest, Romania, in 1993, and the Ph.D. degree in telecommunications from the same institution, in May 1999.

However, due to some effects such as fading or shadowing, an individual sensor may not be able to reliably detect the existence of a primary user (PU). Cooperative spectrum sensing that is proposed to solve such problem, uses a distributed detection system to overcome the severe decadent of received signal strength at some locations in the network. This paper considers the performance of a distributed Neyman-Pearson (N-P) detection system consisting of N sensors and a fusion center, in which the decision rules of the sensors have been given and the decisions of different sensors are mutually independent conditioned on both hypotheses. Theoretical analysis on the performance of this fusion center is carried out. We obtain the conditions for the fusion center to achieve an overall probability of detection that is greater than the local probability of detection of each sensor. Numerical results show that the AND, OR and majority decision fusion rules are the special cases of the N-P fusion rule.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5167826/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-23 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","dateOfInsertion":"21 July 2009","accessionNumber":"10791319","htmlLink":"/document/5167826/","conferenceDate":"18-23 May 2009","displayDocTitle":"Performance analysis of the Neyman-Pearson fusion center for spectrum sensing in a Cognitive Radio network","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance analysis of the Neyman-Pearson fusion center for spectrum sensing in a Cognitive Radio network","confLoc":"St. Petersburg, Russia","sourcePdf":"3=004=416=PID930620.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.113676S","chronDate":"18-23 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5159343","isNumber":"5167592","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5159343","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5167592","articleId":"5167826","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5167831,"authors":[{"name":"Adnan Khashman","affiliation":["Chairman of Intelligent Systems Research Group, Near East University, Nicosia, Cyprus"],"bio":{"p":["Adnan Khashman (M'91-SM'01) received the B.

Thus, a medical image may require compression before transmission or storage. Ideal image compression systems must yield high quality compressed images with high compression ratio; this can be achieved using wavelet transform based compression, however, the choice of an optimum compression ratio is difficult as it varies depending on the content of the image. In this paper, a neural network is trained to relate radiograph image contents to their optimum image compression ratio. Once trained, the neural network chooses the ideal Haar wavelet compression ratio of the x-ray images upon their presentation to the network. Experimental results suggest that our proposed system, can be efficiently used to compress radiographs while maintaining high image quality.","doi":"10.1109/EURCON.2009.5167831","startPage":"1448","endPage":"1453","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE EUROCON 2009","pdfPath":"/iel5/5159343/5167592/05167831.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE EUROCON 2009","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EURCON.2009.5167831","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5167592","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Medical radiographs compression using neural networks and Haar wavelet","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radiography","Neural networks","Image coding","Image storage","Biomedical imaging","Telemedicine","Bandwidth","Wavelet transforms","X-ray imaging","Image quality"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data compression","diagnostic radiography","Haar transforms","image coding","medical image processing","neural nets","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["medical radiography","image compression ratio","neural network","X-ray imaging","Haar wavelet compression ratio","wavelet transform"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Radiographs","X-ray medical images","Optimum image compression","Haar wavelet transform","Neural networks"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5167831/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-23 May 2009","displayDocTitle":"Medical radiographs compression using neural networks and Haar wavelet","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5167831/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","dateOfInsertion":"21 July 2009","conferenceDate":"18-23 May 2009","accessionNumber":"10791324","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Medical radiographs compression using neural networks and Haar wavelet","confLoc":"St. Petersburg, Russia","sourcePdf":"3=004=444=PID930637.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074648S","chronDate":"18-23 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5159343","isNumber":"5167592","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5159343","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"5167592","articleId":"5167831","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":5167859,"authors":[{"name":"Predrag N.

The intention of this work is to minimize the total transmission power under the constraint of the target system data rate. After formulating the optimization problem, the subcarrier allocation algorithm, considered long-term rate fairness, is proposed with a water-filling bit assignment method. In order to guarantee the long-term fairness, the average date rate is introduced to weight the allocating factor in the process of the subcarrier allocation. Furthermore, the water-filling factor is also derived by a novel method in bit assignment procedure. In a conclusion, compared with the convention short term fairness algorithm, the proposed scheme not only guarantees the long term fairness, but also saves the power consumption obviously. The simulation results have shown the advanced performance of the proposed algorithm.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Margin adaptive resource allocation with long-term rate fairness considered in downlink OFDMA systems","publicationTitle":"IEEE EUROCON 2009","doi":"10.1109/EURCON.2009.5167909","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE EUROCON 2009","pdfPath":"/iel5/5159343/5167592/05167909.pdf","startPage":"1919","endPage":"1923","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EURCON.2009.5167909","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5167592","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5167909","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5167909/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-23 May 2009","displayDocTitle":"Margin adaptive resource allocation with long-term rate fairness considered in downlink OFDMA systems","conferenceDate":"18-23 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5167909/","dateOfInsertion":"21 July 2009","publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10798934","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Margin adaptive resource allocation with long-term rate fairness considered in downlink OFDMA systems","confLoc":"St. Petersburg, Russia","sourcePdf":"4=004=75=PID912570.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055387S","chronDate":"18-23 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5159343","isNumber":"5167592","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5159343","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5167592","articleId":"5167909","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":5167916,"authors":[{"name":"Hossein Hajimirsadeghi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Tehran, Iran"],"bio":{"p":["Hossein Hajimirsadeghi received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from University of Tehran, Iran, in 2008.

Patients are so allowed to control external devices or to communicate simple messages through the computer, just concentrating their attention on codified movements or on a letter or icon on a digital keyboard. Using an on-purpose optimized spatial filtering technique in a BCI system, based on the ElectroEncephaloGraphic activity detection, enables to improve its accuracy, due to the explicit separation of the signal activity of interest from non-interesting signals. In this paper, a novel implementation of the spatial filtering ICA algorithm, onto a very performing and flexible hardware platform, is presented. The designed system enables the acquisition and the subsequent ICA elaboration of ElectroEncephaloGraphic signals in real-time, resulting so very effective for BCI applications. The efficiency of the implemented technique has been experimentally demonstrated.","doi":"10.1109/MEMEA.2009.5167962","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Workshop on Medical Measurements and Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Workshop on Medical Measurements and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5161635/5167936/05167962.pdf","startPage":"95","endPage":"98","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MEMEA.2009.5167962","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5167936","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5167962","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel ICA-based hardware system for reconfigurable and portable BCI","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"29-30 May 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5167962/","displayDocTitle":"A novel ICA-based hardware system for reconfigurable and portable BCI","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5167962/","publicationDate":"May 2009","dateOfInsertion":"21 July 2009","conferenceDate":"29-30 May 2009","accessionNumber":"10790999","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel ICA-based hardware system for reconfigurable and portable BCI","confLoc":"Cetraro, Italy","sourcePdf":"MEMEA2009Proceedings_z.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062836S","chronDate":"29-30 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5161635","isNumber":"5167936","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5161635","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"5167936","articleId":"5167962","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5167993,"authors":[{"name":"C.

Our approach, which does not rely on attack-specific knowledge, may provide a complementary detection capability for protecting digital control systems.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"11-12 May 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5168010/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5168010/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10790465","conferenceDate":"11-12 May 2009","publicationDate":"May 2009","dateOfInsertion":"21 July 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Communication pattern anomaly detection in process control systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Communication pattern anomaly detection in process control systems","confLoc":"Waltham, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"005_153.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051995S","chronDate":"11-12 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5159754","isNumber":"5168000","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5159754","citationCount":"39","xplore-issue":"5168000","articleId":"5168010","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5168070,"authors":[{"name":"David M.

The Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) has developed a variety of active millimeter-wave imaging systems and technologies including the cylindrical imaging technique that has been successfully commercialized with L3-Communications/Safeview, and has continued to advance the cylindrical imaging technology using higher frequency ranges up to 100 GHz, and polarimetric imaging techniques. In addition, a standoff, three-dimensional imaging technique and prototype that operates near 350 GHz has been developed. This prototype system uses focusing optics coupled to a high-speed mirror scanning system and can obtain an image in 10 seconds, which is sufficiently fast to conduct extensive imaging tests on cooperative subjects. In this paper, these advanced imaging techniques are described in detail and numerous experimental imaging results are shown.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Conference on Technologies for Homeland Security","pdfPath":"/iel5/5159754/5168000/05168070.pdf","startPage":"440","endPage":"447","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Conference on Technologies for Homeland Security","doi":"10.1109/THS.2009.5168070","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/THS.2009.5168070","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5168000","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5168070","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Active millimeter-wave standoff and portal imaging techniques for personnel screening","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Millimeter wave technology","Portals","Personnel","Optical imaging","Prototypes","Laboratories","Commercialization","Frequency","Focusing","High speed optical techniques"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["millimetre wave imaging","optical focusing","polarimetry"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["active millimeter-wave standoff system","portal imaging technique","personnel screening","Pacific Northwest National Laboratory","cylindrical imaging technique","three-dimensional polarimetric imaging technique","optical focusing","high-speed mirror scanning system","time 10 s","frequency 350 GHz"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5168070/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-12 May 2009","displayDocTitle":"Active millimeter-wave standoff and portal imaging techniques for personnel screening","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5168070/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10790519","dateOfInsertion":"21 July 2009","conferenceDate":"11-12 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Active millimeter-wave standoff and portal imaging techniques for personnel screening","confLoc":"Waltham, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"087_240.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077505S","chronDate":"11-12 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5159754","isNumber":"5168000","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5159754","citationCount":"40","xplore-issue":"5168000","articleId":"5168070","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5168139,"authors":[{"name":"Konstantinos Theodoropoulos","affiliation":["Department of Electronics, University of York, York, UK"],"firstName":"Konstantinos","lastName":"Theodoropoulos","id":"37400623400"},{"name":"Jeremy Everard","affiliation":["Department of Electronics, University of York, York, UK"],"firstName":"Jeremy","lastName":"Everard","id":"37369518400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3511-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3510-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2327-1914"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2327-1949"}],"articleNumber":"5168139","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":139},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5168139","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Phase noise","Silicon","Bipolar transistors","1f noise","Frequency","Phase modulation","Broadband amplifiers","Transfer functions","Linear approximation","Operational amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bipolar transistors","feedback amplifiers","flicker noise","integrated circuit noise","phase noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["residual phase noise modelling","silicon bipolar transistors","bipolar amplifiers","base emitter recombination flicker noise","amplifier phase response"]}],"abstract":"This paper describes the modelling of residual 1/f phase noise for Si bipolar amplifiers operating in the linear region.

behavior. PAs are a truly multidimensional device where many desired performance parameters are contradictory to each other. This is especially true for the generation of modern communication PAs that require high efficiency, high linearity as well as high bandwidth. This paper presents a software-defined measurement setup for fast and cost efficient multidimensional measurements based on highly accurate standard instruments and a PC. The test bed as well as the graphical user interface is presented along with a demonstration of its functionality. During tuning of tank networks, drain quiescent current, and bias conditions, 3-dimensional graphs can be selected for the most appropriate axes of trade-off parameters to display a true behavior of the PA under test subjected to real-world or close to real-world signals. The measurement system offers the possibility to monitor envelope-tracking dynamic power consumption up to 100 MHz plus the possibility to use high crest factors.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5168432/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 May 2009","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"5-7 May 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5168432/","dateOfInsertion":"21 July 2009","publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10789769","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Automated multidimensional characterization of power amplifier for design and production","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automated multidimensional characterization of power amplifier for design and production","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"1569164542.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046409S","chronDate":"5-7 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5159258","isNumber":"5168393","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5159258","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5168393","articleId":"5168432","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5168443,"authors":[{"name":"Olav Andersen","affiliation":["Ericsson AB, Gavle, Sweden"],"firstName":"Olav","lastName":"Andersen","id":"37285244100"},{"name":"Niclas Bjorsell","affiliation":["Center for RF Measurement Technology, University of G\u00e4vle, Gavle, Sweden"],"firstName":"Niclas","lastName":"Bjorsell","id":"37299462500"},{"name":"Niclas Keskitalo","affiliation":["Center for RF Measurement Technology, University of G\u00e4vle, Gavle, Sweden","Ericsson AB, Stockholm, Sweden"],"firstName":"Niclas","lastName":"Keskitalo","id":"37316599600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3352-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3353-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1091-5281"}],"articleNumber":"5168443","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":217},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5168443","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Testing","Sampling methods","Power amplifiers","Radio frequency","Bandwidth","Radiofrequency amplifiers","Power measurement","Switches","Nonlinear systems","Passive filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analogue-digital conversion","Nyquist criterion","power amplifiers","signal sampling","UHF amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Zhu general sampling theorem","power amplifier","IQ-demodulator","IQ-imbalance","test-bed design","direct down converter","ADC bandwidth","Nyquist rate input","analog bandwidth sampling rate","vector signal analyzer","RF front-end frequency range","frequency 500 MHz to 2.7 GHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["component","Zhu's general sampling theorem","Measurement system","Power amplifier"]}],"abstract":"Characterizing power amplifiers require test set-ups with performance superior to the power amplifiers. A commonly used method is to use an IQ-demodulator. However, problem arises due to imperfections in the demodulator such as IQ-imbalance; an alternative method is to use a direct down converter to intermediate frequency. The drawback then is the limited bandwidth. However, the required bandwidth of the ADC does not need to be exceptional. According to Zhu's general sampling theorem is it enough to sample the output signal at the Nyquist rate of the input. However, even though the required sampling rate is reduced the demands on the analog bandwidth remains. Unfortunately, commercially available instruments such as vector signal analyzers can not be used for this purpose since their analog bandwidth is too small. In this paper a test-bed is designed to utilize the Zhu's general sampling theorem. The RF front-end has frequency range of 500 MHz - 2.7 GHz and a bandwidth of 1 GHz.

However, the implementation of the matched filter and the ML detection both need the estimation of the channel impulse response in advance. In this work, we propose a novel method to establish the matched filters of the SIMO channel blindly alongside a three-step technique for the blind and adaptive ML detection of the symbol vector. With the use of the novel method, the system will benefit from the bandwidth efficiency point of view due to the use of blind schemes. The constant modulus algorithm is utilized to perform the blind matched filtering operation and later Least Mean Squared algorithm is introduced for further correction on the matched filter estimate. The blindly estimated matched filters are incorporated into the ML detector so that the transmitted symbols are found and therefore the channel is equalized. Simulations are provided to present the equalization performance and convergence speed of the novel technique.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5168527/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 May 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"5-7 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","dateOfInsertion":"21 July 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5168527/","accessionNumber":"10789864","displayDocTitle":"A blind implementation of multi-dimensional matched filtering in a Maximum-Likelihood receiver for SIMO channels","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A blind implementation of multi-dimensional matched filtering in a Maximum-Likelihood receiver for SIMO channels","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"1569171493.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073211S","chronDate":"5-7 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5159258","isNumber":"5168393","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5159258","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5168393","articleId":"5168527","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5168559,"authors":[{"name":"M.

A mote communicates with other nodes based on the information collected through the sensor module attached with multiple sensors, e.g., accelerometer, pressure, temperature and humidity sensors. It is important that the sensors provide accurate readout of the physical quantity that they sense, especially when the motes are operated in harsh environments. In this paper we propose intelligent sensors for the sensor module using a computationally efficient Laguerre neural networks (LaNN) to auto-compensate for the associated nonlinearity and environmental dependence, and provide linearized sensor readout even when the motes are operated in harsh environments. By taking an example of a capacitive pressure sensor, through computer simulations we have shown that the LaNN-based sensor model can provide highly linearized sensor output. The performance of the LaNN sensor model is compared with a multilayer perceptron-based sensor model, and it is observed that the former model is superior in terms of computational efficiency while providing similar linearity performance.","doi":"10.1109/IMTC.2009.5168565","pdfPath":"/iel5/5159258/5168393/05168565.pdf","startPage":"832","endPage":"837","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Instrumentation and Measurement Technology Conference","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Instrumentation and Measurement Technology Conference","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IMTC.2009.5168565","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5168393","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Laguerre neural network-based smart sensors for wireless sensor networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5168565/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 May 2009","displayDocTitle":"Laguerre neural network-based smart sensors for wireless sensor networks","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"21 July 2009","accessionNumber":"10789901","publicationDate":"May 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5168565/","conferenceDate":"5-7 May 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Laguerre neural network-based smart sensors for wireless sensor networks","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"1569163798.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047697S","chronDate":"5-7 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5159258","isNumber":"5168393","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5159258","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"5168393","articleId":"5168565","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5168568,"authors":[{"name":"R.

For low-cost high performance embedded networking applications, the best solution could be doing packet classification by specially designed hardware which can effectively release the burden of system CPU. We have realized a compact FPGA-based packet classification coprocessor in an embedded system using MPC8260 under Linux operation system. High degree parallel architecture of the coprocessor allows it to run at line rate above 20 Gbps without packet losing. Furthermore, the coprocessor has deterministic search time and low memory consumption. By using Netfilter hooks in Linux network protocol stack MPC8260 manages the coprocessor to take the full charge of packet classification, so the performance of the system is not influenced much when multi-dimensional packet classification executed.

To enable blind signal demodulation, the symbol rate must be determined. Recent techniques for determining symbol rates follow one of two broad approaches. The first approach estimates the carrier frequency and down-converts the signal for analysis at base-band. This approach is computationally expensive as carrier extraction hardware is needed for each modulation scheme. The other approach applies the wavelet transform to an over-sampled received signal to detect phase jumps and frequency changes. This paper introduces a new approach for detecting modulation-based carrier changes by monitoring the behaviour of an error signal associated with a direct frequency estimator. The proposed method has a simple architecture and eliminates the need for over-sampling seen in the wavelet transform approach. Symbol rate estimations were made under different carrier-to-noise ratios (CNRs) and modulation types and the results are provided.","doi":"10.1109/IMTC.2009.5168587","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Instrumentation and Measurement Technology Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Instrumentation and Measurement Technology Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5159258/5168393/05168587.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IMTC.2009.5168587","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5168393","startPage":"943","endPage":"946","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Symbol rate classification of PSK/QAM signals using direct frequency estimators","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5168587","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Symbol rate classification of PSK/QAM signals using direct frequency estimators","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 May 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5168587/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"5-7 May 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10789923","dateOfInsertion":"21 July 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5168587/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Symbol rate classification of PSK/QAM signals using direct frequency estimators","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"1569166778.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072135S","chronDate":"5-7 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5159258","isNumber":"5168393","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5159258","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5168393","articleId":"5168587","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5168609,"authors":[{"name":"Cheng-Ta Chiang","affiliation":["Measurement Techniques Laboratory, Department of Electronics Engineering and Institute of Electronics, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan","Microsystems Technology Center, Industrial Technology and Research Institute, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Cheng-Ta Chiang","id":"37087430678"},{"name":"Yu-Chung Huang","affiliation":["Measurement Techniques Laboratory, Department of Electronics Engineering and Institute of Electronics, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Yu-Chung Huang","id":"37087263013"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3352-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3353-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1091-5281"}],"articleNumber":"5168609","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":352},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Delta modulation","Silicon","Microphones","Circuit simulation","CMOS technology","Circuit testing","Power supplies","MATLAB","SPICE","Energy consumption"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS integrated circuits","delta-sigma modulation","integrated circuit testing","microphones","silicon","SPICE"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["oversampled delta-sigma modulator","silicon condenser microphone","2P4M CMOS technology","MATLAB","SPICE simulation","chip fabrication","mobile phone","word length 14 bit","size 0.35 mum","voltage 3 V","power 5.25 mW"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["delta-sigma modulator","silicon condenser microphones","ADC"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5168609","doi":"10.1109/IMTC.2009.5168609","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IMTC.2009.5168609","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5168393","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Instrumentation and Measurement Technology Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Instrumentation and Measurement Technology Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5159258/5168393/05168609.pdf","startPage":"1055","endPage":"1058","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 14-bit oversampled delta-sigma modulator for silicon condenser microphones","abstract":"In this paper, a 14-bit oversampled delta-sigma modulator for silicon condenser microphones is newly proposed.

Software such as MATLAB, MAPLE, etc allows control engineers to design their systems easily through graphical programming. However, implementation of a software-based control design on hardware such as FPGA or DSP are met with a difficult challenge as hardware constraints tend to limit the performance or affect the output of the control design. An example would be a state observer which is comprised of differential equations. To process the differential equations on embedded systems using standard algorithms is not feasible and with increasing complexity of control designs, state observers are restricted to general purpose processors. Based on previous research, an alternative approach to developing state observers is by using neural networks to solve the differential equations. This paper presents a methodology on implementation of a neural network based state observer onto FPGA. The study of this research showed that the state observer design can be implemented on hardware without the need to sacrifice performance or increase the cost of implementation. The prospects of this research can be applied to fields such as fault tolerant or self-diagnostic systems.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hardware design of neural network system state observer","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Instrumentation and Measurement Technology Conference","doi":"10.1109/IMTC.2009.5168611","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Instrumentation and Measurement Technology Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5159258/5168393/05168611.pdf","startPage":"1063","endPage":"1068","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IMTC.2009.5168611","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5168393","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5168611","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5168611/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 May 2009","displayDocTitle":"Hardware design of neural network system state observer","conferenceDate":"5-7 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5168611/","dateOfInsertion":"21 July 2009","publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10789947","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hardware design of neural network system state observer","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"1569166860.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066069S","chronDate":"5-7 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5159258","isNumber":"5168393","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5159258","xplore-issue":"5168393","articleId":"5168611","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5168658,"authors":[{"name":"G.

The analog system basically describes the nonlinear state-space equations using nonlinear functions and integrators. The initial architectural structure is described to give the potential users the ability to evaluate the possible use of the test bench.

The Hann window very efficiently reduce the systematic error in the case of a large damping independently of the coherency, but perform worse results at lower values of the damping and under `almost coherent conditions'.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 May 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5168660/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"10789995","publicationDate":"May 2009","conferenceDate":"5-7 May 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5168660/","dateOfInsertion":"21 July 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A frequency domain procedure for estimation of the exponentially damped sinusoids","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A frequency domain procedure for estimation of the exponentially damped sinusoids","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"1569165006.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046727S","chronDate":"5-7 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5159258","isNumber":"5168393","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5159258","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"5168393","articleId":"5168660","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5168692,"authors":[{"name":"Stanislaw Osowski","affiliation":["Warsaw University of Technology, Warsaw, Poland","Military University of Technology, Warsaw, Poland"],"firstName":"Stanislaw","lastName":"Osowski","id":"37267431500"},{"name":"Stanislaw Osowski","affiliation":["Military University of Technology, Warsaw, Poland"],"firstName":"Stanislaw","lastName":"Osowski","id":"37267431500"},{"name":"Robert Siroic","affiliation":["Military University of Technology, Warsaw, Poland"],"firstName":"Robert","lastName":"Siroic","id":"37086715562"},{"name":"Krzysztof Siwek","affiliation":["Military University of Technology, Warsaw, Poland"],"firstName":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Siwek","id":"37267431700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3352-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3353-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1091-5281"}],"articleNumber":"5168692","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":91},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5168692","abstract":"The paper presents application of the genetic algorithm for the integration of classifiers used in the ensemble for the accurate recognition of arrhythmia on the basis of ECG waveform.

Most of the previous work focused on either cooperative sensing or sensing scheduling as a viable means to improve the detection performance without studying their interactions. In this paper, we propose an optimal spectrum sensing framework in CRNs that jointly exploits sensors' cooperation and sensing scheduling to meet the desired detection performance with minimum sensing overhead. Specifically, we propose an optimal sensing framework for the IEEE 802.22 wireless regional area networks (WRANs) that directs the base station (BS) to manage spectrum sensing by (i) constructing each primary signal's spatial profile of received signal strengths (RSSs) as a detection criterion, (ii) selecting an optimal set of sensors for cooperative sensing, and (iii) finding an optimal time to stop sensing. This framework will ensure the desired sensing performance of 802.22 with minimum sensing overhead. Our evaluation results show that the proposed sensing algorithms reduce the sensing overhead significantly and lower the feasible operation region of energy detector by 13 dB for practical scenarios.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Optimal Sensing Framework Based on Spatial RSS-profile in Cognitive Radio Networks","publicationTitle":"2009 6th Annual IEEE Communications Society Conference on Sensor, Mesh and Ad Hoc Communications and Networks","doi":"10.1109/SAHCN.2009.5168908","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 6th Annual IEEE Communications Society Conference on Sensor, Mesh and Ad Hoc Communications and Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/5168894/5168895/05168908.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"9","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SAHCN.2009.5168908","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5168895","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5168908","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5168908/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-26 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"An Optimal Sensing Framework Based on Spatial RSS-profile in Cognitive Radio Networks","conferenceDate":"22-26 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5168908/","dateOfInsertion":"21 July 2009","publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10791949","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Optimal Sensing Framework Based on Spatial RSS-profile in Cognitive Radio Networks","confLoc":"Rome, Italy","sourcePdf":"PID888809.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058709S","chronDate":"22-26 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5168894","isNumber":"5168895","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5168894","citationCount":"40","xplore-issue":"5168895","articleId":"5168908","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5168928,"authors":[{"name":"Sriram Lakshmanan","affiliation":["Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Sriram","lastName":"Lakshmanan","id":"37306634100"},{"name":"Raghupathy Sivakumar","affiliation":["Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Raghupathy","lastName":"Sivakumar","id":"37272145500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2907-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2908-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2155-5486"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2155-5494"}],"articleNumber":"5168928","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":43,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":316},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5168928","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Spread spectrum communication","Wireless networks","Transmitters","Physical layer","Routing protocols","Antenna arrays","Peer to peer computing","Performance gain","Diversity methods","Clustering algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cooperative systems","diversity reception","radio transmitters","routing protocols","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multihop wireless networks","adaptive diversity routing protocol","cooperative transmissions","virtual MISO links","multiple input single output","physical layer","cooperating transmitters","Proteus","VMISO links","NS2 based simulations","VMISO transmissions"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we consider the use of cooperative transmissions in multi-hop wireless networks to achieve virtual MISO (multiple input single output) links.

Recent developments in energy harvesting technology allow sensors to be powered by environmental energy where it is present, but the wide range of situations where sensors are deployed means that it is desirable for the energy components of a sensor node (i.e. batteries, supercapacitors, and power generation devices) to be selected and configured at the time of node deployment. Previous energy harvesting-powered systems have been designed for specific energy hardware and been difficult to adapt for different resources. Energy-awareness is useful for state-of-the-art network algorithms, but present systems do not provide a standardized or straightforward way for nodes to monitor and manage their energy hardware. The developments reported in this paper deliver a reconfigurable energy subsystem for wireless autonomous sensors. The new system permits energy modules to be selected and fitted to the sensor node in-situ, in a plug-and-play manner, without the need for reprogramming or the modification of hardware. The node can monitor and intelligently manage its energy resources and assess its overall energy status by analyzing its level of stored energy and rate of power generation. These activities are facilitated by a proposed common hardware interface (which allows multiple energy modules to be connected) and an electronic datasheet structure for the energy modules. The system has been verified through the development and testing of a prototype wireless sensor node which operates from a mix of energy sources.","doi":"10.1109/SAHCN.2009.5168947","publicationTitle":"2009 6th Annual IEEE Communications Society Conference on Sensor, Mesh and Ad Hoc Communications and Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 6th Annual IEEE Communications Society Conference on Sensor, Mesh and Ad Hoc Communications and Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/5168894/5168895/05168947.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"9","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5168895","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SAHCN.2009.5168947","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5168947","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modular Plug-and-Play Power Resources for Energy-Aware Wireless Sensor Nodes","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5168947/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-26 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"Modular Plug-and-Play Power Resources for Energy-Aware Wireless Sensor Nodes","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"10791988","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"21 July 2009","publicationDate":"June 2009","conferenceDate":"22-26 June 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5168947/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modular Plug-and-Play Power Resources for Energy-Aware Wireless Sensor Nodes","confLoc":"Rome, Italy","sourcePdf":"PID889454.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.105338S","chronDate":"22-26 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5168894","isNumber":"5168895","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5168894","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"5168895","articleId":"5168947","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5168954,"authors":[{"name":"Joe Bater","affiliation":["Centre of Telecommunications Value-chain Research, Cork Constraint Computation Centre, University College Cork, Ireland"],"firstName":"Joe","lastName":"Bater","id":"37937310200"},{"name":"Kenneth N.

A WSP temporarily leases licensed channels from the primary licensees via spectrum auction, and subleases them to CR end-users or customers, each demanding a different amount of spectrum, according to its own advertised pricing policy. The CR customers use the subleased channels opportunistically when the channels are not being used by primary/legacy users, and hence, the amount of available spectrum resource varies with time. A WSP should, therefore, maximize its average profit by 'optimally' (in some sense) (1) controlling the admission/rejection of arriving CR end-users, and (2) determining a policy of evicting in-service opportunistic users at the channel to which primary users return. To our best knowledge, this is the first attempt to jointly optimize admission and eviction controls for the dynamic spectrum market. The WSP's profit maximization problem is formulated with a semi-Markov decision process (SMDP) and its corresponding linear programming (LP) setup. This problem is found to become nonlinear programming (NLP) subject to two quality-of-service (QoS) constraints on request-blocking and user-dropping probabilities, which can fortunately be converted to LP via some manipulation. Using an extensive numerical analysis, we discovered that the derived optimal policy achieves up to 81% more profit than a complete-sharing (CS) algorithm in the tested scenario. We also investigate tradeoffs between the two QoS constraints, and consider other important factors affecting WSP's profit maximization such as the number of leased channels, the end-user pricing, and the cost for reimbursing evicted customers.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"22-26 June 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5168955/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"10791996","publicationDate":"June 2009","conferenceDate":"22-26 June 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5168955/","dateOfInsertion":"21 July 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Optimal Admission and Eviction Control of Secondary Users at Cognitive Radio HotSpots","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal Admission and Eviction Control of Secondary Users at Cognitive Radio HotSpots","confLoc":"Rome, Italy","sourcePdf":"PID888773.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.118586S","chronDate":"22-26 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5168894","isNumber":"5168895","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5168894","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"5168895","articleId":"5168955","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5168956,"authors":[{"name":"Ramya Srinivasan","affiliation":["Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, USA"],"firstName":"Ramya","lastName":"Srinivasan","id":"37970756600"},{"name":"Douglas Blough","affiliation":["Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, USA"],"firstName":"Douglas","lastName":"Blough","id":"37273088000"},{"name":"Paolo Santi","affiliation":["IIT-CNR, Pisa, Italy"],"firstName":"Paolo","lastName":"Santi","id":"37273087100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2907-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2908-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2155-5486"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2155-5494"}],"articleNumber":"5168956","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":119},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Throughput","Interference cancellation","Transmitting antennas","Receiving antennas","Transmitters","Paper technology","USA Councils","Upper bound","Communications Society"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["interference suppression","MIMO communication","multiplexing","radio links","scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimal one-shot stream scheduling","MIMO links","single collision domain","MIMO degrees of freedom model","antenna arrays","interference cancellation","spatial multiplexing"]}],"abstract":"This paper considers the problem of scheduling the maximum number of streams in a single time slot under the MIMO degrees of freedom (DOF) model, when all links are in a single collision domain. In the DOF model, nodes can use degrees of freedom provided by their antenna arrays to multiplex multiple streams on a single link and/or cancel interference between concurrently transmitting links. Given a set of links with data to transmit that are free of primary interference, we provide optimal constructions for both the case where only spatial reuse (from interference cancellation) is allowed and the case where both spatial reuse and spatial multiplexing can be done simultaneously. Our analysis allows deriving clean throughput performance trends when the number of available DOFs is arbitrarily increased. These trends show that combining spatial multiplexing with spatial reuse can arbitrarily increase throughput compared to spatial reuse only, and that close to two-fold throughput increases can be achieved compared to spatial multiplexing only. Finally, we show how the approach can be extended to deal with primary interference and optimally solve the one-shot stream scheduling problem for an arbitrary set of MIMO links in a single collision domain.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal One-Shot Stream Scheduling for MIMO Links in a Single Collision Domain","publicationTitle":"2009 6th Annual IEEE Communications Society Conference on Sensor, Mesh and Ad Hoc Communications and Networks","doi":"10.1109/SAHCN.2009.5168956","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 6th Annual IEEE Communications Society Conference on Sensor, Mesh and Ad Hoc Communications and Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/5168894/5168895/05168956.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"9","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SAHCN.2009.5168956","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5168895","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5168956","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5168956/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-26 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"Optimal One-Shot Stream Scheduling for MIMO Links in a Single Collision Domain","conferenceDate":"22-26 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5168956/","dateOfInsertion":"21 July 2009","publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10791997","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal One-Shot Stream Scheduling for MIMO Links in a Single Collision Domain","confLoc":"Rome, Italy","sourcePdf":"PID890611.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.101742S","chronDate":"22-26 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5168894","isNumber":"5168895","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5168894","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"5168895","articleId":"5168956","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5168968,"authors":[{"name":"Giordano Fusco","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Giordano","lastName":"Fusco","id":"37542514900"},{"name":"Himanshu Gupta","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Himanshu","lastName":"Gupta","id":"37270217000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2907-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2908-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2155-5486"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2155-5494"}],"articleNumber":"5168968","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":73,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":612},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Greedy algorithms","Algorithm design and analysis","Sensor phenomena and characterization","Cameras","Approximation algorithms","Peer to peer computing","Communications Society","Computer science","Monitoring","Organizations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["directional sensors","coverage maximization","sensor nodes","camera","multiple sensing regions","NP-complete","NP-hard","sensor networks"]}],"abstract":"Sensor nodes may be equipped with a \"directional\" sensing device (such as a camera) which senses a physical phenomenon in a certain direction depending on the chosen orientation. In this article, we address the problem of selection and orientation of such directional sensors with the objective of maximizing coverage area. Prior works on sensor coverage have largely focused on coverage with sensors that are associated with a unique sensing region. In contrast, directional sensors have multiple sensing regions associated with them, and the orientation of the sensor determines the actual sensing region. Thus, the coverage problems in the context of directional sensors entails selection as well as orientation of sensors needed to activate in order to maximize/ensure coverage. In this article, we address the problem of selecting a minimum number of sensors and assigning orientations such that the given area (or set of target points) is k-covered (i.e., each point is covered k times). The above problem is NP-complete, and even NP-hard to approximate. Thus, we design a simple greedy algorithm that delivers a solution that k-covers at least half of the target points using at most M log(k|C|) sensors, where |C| is the maximum number of target points covered by a sensor and M is the minimum number of sensor required to k-cover all the given points. The above result holds for almost arbitrary sensing regions. We design a distributed implementation of the above algorithm, and study its performance through simulations. In addition to the above problem, we also look at other related coverage problems in the context of directional sensors, and design similar approximation algorithms for them.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Selection and Orientation of Directional Sensors for Coverage Maximization","publicationTitle":"2009 6th Annual IEEE Communications Society Conference on Sensor, Mesh and Ad Hoc Communications and Networks","doi":"10.1109/SAHCN.2009.5168968","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 6th Annual IEEE Communications Society Conference on Sensor, Mesh and Ad Hoc Communications and Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/5168894/5168895/05168968.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"9","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SAHCN.2009.5168968","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5168895","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5168968","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5168968/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-26 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"Selection and Orientation of Directional Sensors for Coverage Maximization","conferenceDate":"22-26 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5168968/","dateOfInsertion":"21 July 2009","publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10792009","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Selection and Orientation of Directional Sensors for Coverage Maximization","confLoc":"Rome, Italy","sourcePdf":"PID889796.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.081842S","chronDate":"22-26 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5168894","isNumber":"5168895","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5168894","citationCount":"73","xplore-issue":"5168895","articleId":"5168968","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-30"},{"_id":5168974,"authors":[{"name":"Loukas Lazos","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Arizona Tucson, USA"],"firstName":"Loukas","lastName":"Lazos","id":"37266503000"},{"name":"Sisi Liu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Arizona Tucson, USA"],"firstName":"Sisi","lastName":"Liu","id":"37310595700"},{"name":"Marwan Krunz","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Arizona Tucson, USA"],"firstName":"Marwan","lastName":"Krunz","id":"37280483100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2907-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2908-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2155-5486"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2155-5494"}],"articleNumber":"5168974","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":102,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":714},"abstract":"We address the problem of dynamic assignment of coordination (control) channels in cognitive radio networks (CRNs) by exploiting time- and space-varying spectrum opportunities. Motivated by the inherent grouping of Cognitive Radio (CR) users according to channel availability, we propose a cluster-based architecture for control-channel assignment in a CRN. CRs are grouped in the same cluster if they roughly sense similar idle channels and are within communication range, either directly or via a cluster-head. We formulate the clustering design as a maximum edge biclique problem. A distributed cluster agreement algorithm called Spectrum-Opportunity Clustering (SOC) is proposed to solve this problem. SOC provides a desirable balance between two competing factors: the set of common idle channels within each cluster and the cluster size. A large set of common idle channels within each cluster allows graceful migration from the current control channel should primary radio (PR) activity appear on that channel. Hence, SOC provides a stable network partition with respect to local coordination, with no need for frequent re-clustering. Moreover, when re-clustering has to be performed (due to CR mobility or PR activity), CRs agree on new clusters after the broadcast of only three messages, thus incurring low communication overhead.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 6th Annual IEEE Communications Society Conference on Sensor, Mesh and Ad Hoc Communications and Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/5168894/5168895/05168974.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"9","publicationTitle":"2009 6th Annual IEEE Communications Society Conference on Sensor, Mesh and Ad Hoc Communications and Networks","doi":"10.1109/SAHCN.2009.5168974","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SAHCN.2009.5168974","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5168895","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5168974","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spectrum Opportunity-Based Control Channel Assignment in Cognitive Radio Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radio control","Cognitive radio","Chromium","Frequency","Communication system control","Radio broadcasting","Communications Society","Computer networks","Computer architecture","Clustering algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel allocation","cognitive radio","distributed algorithms","graph theory","spectral analysis","telecommunication control","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio network","dynamic control channel assignment","space-varying spectrum opportunity clustering","time-varying spectrum opportunity","maximum edge biclique problem","distributed cluster agreement algorithm","primary radio"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5168974/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-26 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"Spectrum Opportunity-Based Control Channel Assignment in Cognitive Radio Networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5168974/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10792015","dateOfInsertion":"21 July 2009","conferenceDate":"22-26 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spectrum Opportunity-Based Control Channel Assignment in Cognitive Radio Networks","confLoc":"Rome, Italy","sourcePdf":"PID888399.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071176S","chronDate":"22-26 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5168894","isNumber":"5168895","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5168894","citationCount":"102","xplore-issue":"5168895","articleId":"5168974","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5168976,"authors":[{"name":"Ahren Studer","affiliation":["Carnegie Mellon University, USA"],"firstName":"Ahren","lastName":"Studer","id":"37534427100"},{"name":"Elaine Shi","affiliation":["Carnegie Mellon University, USA"],"firstName":"Elaine","lastName":"Shi","id":"37271533200"},{"name":"Fan Bai","affiliation":["General Motors Company Limited, USA"],"firstName":"Fan","lastName":"Bai","id":"37266678300"},{"name":"Adrian Perrig","affiliation":["Carnegie Mellon University, USA"],"firstName":"Adrian","lastName":"Perrig","id":"37271812800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2907-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2908-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2155-5486"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2155-5494"}],"articleNumber":"5168976","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":131,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":1276},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Authentication","Privacy","Road vehicles","Telecommunication traffic","Ad hoc networks","Public key","Communications Society","Vehicle driving","Joining processes","Communication standards"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ad hoc networks","data privacy","message authentication","mobile radio","public key cryptography","telecommunication security","vehicles"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["temporary anonymous certified key","vehicular ad hoc network","message authentication","valid vehicle identification","remove malevolent vehicle","public key infrastructure","eavesdropper","VANET key management","vehicle-to-vehicle communication","IEEE 1609.2 standard","VANET security"]}],"abstract":"Vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) require a mechanism to help authenticate messages, identify valid vehicles, and remove malevolent vehicles.

Challenges are that disambiguation is depending on the contextual information. This paper collected contextual information statistics of covering ambiguity words and found a context calculation mode by using log likelihood ratio. A weighing calculation formula is designed for considering contextual informationpsilas window size and location and the influence of frequency on covering ambiguity. Based on this, two methods are used for disambiguation. One is using the maximum log likelihood ratio in contextual information; the other is using the maximum numerical value of the sum of respective log likelihood ratio under the situation of combination or separation in contextual information. 14 frequently appeared covering ambiguous words are used as examples. The average accuracy of the former method reaches 84.93%, and that of the latter reaches 95.60 %. The result of the experiment reveals that using the combination of contextual information is effective for disambiguation.","doi":"10.1109/ICIC.2009.119","publicationTitle":"2009 Second International Conference on Information and Computing Science","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Second International Conference on Information and Computing Science","pdfPath":"/iel5/5168779/5168983/05169003.pdf","startPage":"43","endPage":"46","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIC.2009.119","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5168983","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Context-Based Approach for Covering Ambiguity Resolution in Chinese Word Segmentation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5169003","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-22 May 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5169003/","displayDocTitle":"Context-Based Approach for Covering Ambiguity Resolution in Chinese Word Segmentation","volume":"2","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10791640","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5169003/","conferenceDate":"21-22 May 2009","dateOfInsertion":"21 July 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Context-Based Approach for Covering Ambiguity Resolution in Chinese Word Segmentation","confLoc":"Manchester, UK","sourcePdf":"3634b043.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057693S","chronDate":"21-22 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5168779","isNumber":"5168983","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5168779","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5168983","articleId":"5169003","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5169010,"authors":[{"name":"Chao Deng","affiliation":["College of Computer Science & Technology, Henan Polytechnic University, Jiaozuo, China"],"firstName":"Chao","lastName":"Deng","id":"37575780300"},{"name":"Ji Yu An","affiliation":["College of Computer Science & Technology, Henan Polytechnic University, Jiaozuo, China"],"firstName":"Ji Yu","lastName":"An","id":"37587446200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3634-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2160-7443"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2160-7451"}],"articleNumber":"5169010","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":200},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5169010","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Filters","PSNR","Pixel","Discrete wavelet transforms","Computer networks","Digital images","Filtering","Educational institutions","Image restoration"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image denoising","image restoration","impulse noise","median filters","neural nets","statistical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wavelet neural network","impulse noise removal technique","digital image restoration","noise-pixel detection","median filter","statistical analysis","visual evaluation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["impulse noise","median filter","wavelet"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICIC.2009.126","pdfPath":"/iel5/5168779/5168983/05169010.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 Second International Conference on Information and Computing Science","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Second International Conference on Information and Computing Science","startPage":"71","endPage":"74","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5168983","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIC.2009.126","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Impulse Noise Removal Based on a Wavelet Neural Network","abstract":"A new impulse noise removal technique which is based on wavelet neural network, is applied to restore digital images corrupted by impulse noise.

What is shown in the simulation result is that while the error-rate performance of the new decoding structure based on LPCA is only lower by 0.1-0.2dB than the traditional Turbo decoding structure, a decoding iterative process of the component decoder could be reduced in the LPCA-Turbo.","doi":"10.1109/ICIC.2009.134","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIC.2009.134","startPage":"102","endPage":"105","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Second International Conference on Information and Computing Science","pdfPath":"/iel5/5168779/5168983/05169018.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 Second International Conference on Information and Computing Science","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5168983","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Iterative Decoding Structure Design of LPCA-Turbo","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"21-22 May 2009","displayDocTitle":"Iterative Decoding Structure Design of LPCA-Turbo","conferenceDate":"21-22 May 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","dateOfInsertion":"21 July 2009","isConference":true,"volume":"2","htmlLink":"/document/5169018/","accessionNumber":"10791655","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5169018/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Iterative Decoding Structure Design of LPCA-Turbo","confLoc":"Manchester, UK","sourcePdf":"3634b102.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.036367S","chronDate":"21-22 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5168779","isNumber":"5168983","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5168779","xplore-issue":"5168983","articleId":"5169018","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5169023,"authors":[{"name":"Xu Yong-Feng","affiliation":["Department of Mathematic, Northwest University Xian, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China"],"firstName":"Xu","lastName":"Yong-Feng","id":"38273004800"},{"name":"Zhang Shu-Ling","affiliation":["Department of Mathematic, Northwest University Xian, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China"],"firstName":"Zhang","lastName":"Shu-Ling","id":"38285879600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3634-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2160-7443"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2160-7451"}],"articleNumber":"5169023","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":182},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Particle swarm optimization","Infrared imaging","Clustering algorithms","Partitioning algorithms","Image segmentation","Optical computing","Mathematics","Image processing","Entropy","Unsupervised learning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fuzzy set theory","image processing","infrared imaging","particle swarm optimisation","pattern clustering","search problems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fuzzy particle swarm clustering","infrared image processing","adaptive clustering algorithm","particle swarm optimization","fuzzy C-mean clustering algorithm","search algorithm","image clustering algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["infrared image","adaptive clustering","particle swarm optimization","fuzzy C-mean"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5169023","abstract":"Considering the characteristics of the inconspicuous difference between targets and backgrounds and the low contrast in infrared images, an adaptive clustering algorithm based on fuzzy particle swarm optimization is used in the infrared image processing. Fuzzy C-mean (FCM) clustering algorithm is a local search algorithm because it is easily trapped local optimum and is sensitive to initial value effectively. On the other hand, particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is a global optimization algorithm. By incorporating the local search ability of FCM algorithm and the global optimization ability of PSO and taking the clustering criterion function of FCM as the object function of PSO, a new hybrid image clustering algorithm based on particle swarm optimization and fuzzy C-mean algorithm is proposed.

Since 1980s, many researchers have used Back Propagation Neural Network BPNN to forecast stock price fluctuations. However, there are some limitations with BPNN. With slow convergent speed and low learning efficiency, BP learning algorithm is easy to get in local minimum and is far from being perfect in stock forecasting. The genetic algorithm is a sort of selfadaptive optimized search algorithm based on natural selection and natural inheritance. It can be applied in different areas of parameter space in the colony generation subrogation toward the optimal direction, which the search could easily find and couldn\u2019t get in local minimization. In view of this, we adopt the genetic algorithm to train the BPNN to overcome the above shortcomings. By adding genetic algorithm we built an optimized stock index prediction model for Shanghai composite index. Through empirical analysis, we come to the conclusion that the above model optimized by genetic algorithm possesses better function approximating capacity, and has ideal result for the short-term stock index forecast.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-22 May 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5169090/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10791727","isConference":true,"volume":"2","htmlLink":"/document/5169090/","publicationDate":"May 2009","dateOfInsertion":"21 July 2009","conferenceDate":"21-22 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Stock Index Forecast with Back Propagation Neural Network Optimized by Genetic Algorithm","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Stock Index Forecast with Back Propagation Neural Network Optimized by Genetic Algorithm","confLoc":"Manchester, UK","sourcePdf":"3634b376.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.080746S","chronDate":"21-22 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5168779","isNumber":"5168983","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5168779","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5168983","articleId":"5169090","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":5169127,"authors":[{"name":"Yuangui Tang","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Robotics, Shenyang Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy and Sciences, Shenyang, China","Chinese Academy and Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yuangui","lastName":"Tang","id":"37855328400"},{"name":"Aiqun Zhang","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Robotics, Shenyang Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy and Sciences, Shenyang, China"],"firstName":"Aiqun","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37276880800"},{"name":"Jiancheng Yu","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Robotics, Shenyang Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy and Sciences, Shenyang, China"],"firstName":"Jiancheng","lastName":"Yu","id":"37278394300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3634-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2160-7443"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2160-7451"}],"articleNumber":"5169127","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":292},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Mobile robots","Robotics and automation","Mathematical model","Creep","Oceans","Motion analysis","Virtual prototyping","Animals","Laboratories","Performance analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["marine systems","mobile robots","optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wheel-propeller-leg integrated driving mechanism","amphibious robot","ocean floor","multilocomotion models","compound-mobile mechanism","multiobjective optimization theory","comprehensive optimization","virtual prototype","unstructured environment"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["wheel-propeller-leg integration","multi-locomotion models","compound-mobile mechanism","multi-objective optimization"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5169127","abstract":"A wheel-propeller-leg integrated amphibious robot is presented as a new type of robot, which can both crawl on land and swim underwater in certain depth or creep on ocean floor.

A major impairment in FSO links is the turbulence-induced scintillations of an optical wave. Spatial diversity, which involves the deployment of multiple laser transmitters/receivers, can be used over FSO links to reduce the turbulence-induced scintillations. In this paper, the channel of a multiple-transmitter-multiple-receiver FSO link considering the spatial correlation between the constituent sub-channels was mathematically modeled and then the joint distribution function of the channel gain coefficients was derived. Base on the joint distribution function, the model for the outage probability of a FSO link with spatial diversity was established. With Monte Carlo method, simulations for the outage probability were performed. The results show that spatial correlations have a significant influence on the outage probability, and the diversity-induced performance improvement reduces to zero as the spatial correlation coefficient increases to 1.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Second International Conference on Information and Computing Science","pdfPath":"/iel5/5168779/5169100/05169163.pdf","startPage":"209","endPage":"211","publicationTitle":"2009 Second International Conference on Information and Computing Science","doi":"10.1109/ICIC.2009.363","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIC.2009.363","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5169100","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5169163","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Model for Outage Probability of Free-Space Optical Links with Spatial Diversity through Atmospheric Turbulence","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Atmospheric modeling","Optical fiber communication","Optical receivers","Optical transmitters","Distribution functions","Atmospheric waves","Radio frequency","Laser modes","Radio transmitters","Mathematical model"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["atmospheric optics","laser beam applications","light propagation","optical communication","optical links","optical receivers","optical transmitters","scintillation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["outage probability model","spatially diverse FSO links","free space optical links","atmospheric turbulence","very high rate data transmission","optical wave turbulence induced scintillations","multiple-transmitter-multiple-receiver FSO link","constituent subchannel spatial correlation","channel gain coefficient joint distribution function"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["outage probability","spatial diversity","joint distribution function","free-space optical link","simulation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5169163/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-22 May 2009","displayDocTitle":"Model for Outage Probability of Free-Space Optical Links with Spatial Diversity through Atmospheric Turbulence","isConference":true,"volume":"4","htmlLink":"/document/5169163/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10791773","dateOfInsertion":"21 July 2009","conferenceDate":"21-22 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Model for Outage Probability of Free-Space Optical Links with Spatial Diversity through Atmospheric Turbulence","confLoc":"Manchester, UK","sourcePdf":"3634d209.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.103705S","chronDate":"21-22 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5168779","isNumber":"5169100","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5168779","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5169100","articleId":"5169163","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5169200,"authors":[{"name":"Xiang-quan Chang","affiliation":["Sch. of Manage., Univ. of Jinan, Jinan, China"],"firstName":"Xiang-quan","lastName":"Chang","id":"37088202342"},{"name":"Yan-fang Wang","affiliation":["University of Jinan"],"firstName":"Yan-fang","lastName":"Wang","id":"37088206474"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3634-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2160-7443"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2160-7451"}],"articleNumber":"5169200","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":42},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5169200","abstract":"An approach for emergency service nodes location problem based on improved genetic algorithm is proposed.

Microarray image analysis is complicated, time consuming task and requires manual intervention. Gridding of Microarray image is performed before spot segmentation. The spatial non-uniformity of spots results in non-uniform grid alignment, which leads to inconsistency of extracted feature from the spot. This paper presents a novel automatic approach to locate the spots without the formation of grids. An approach using Genetic algorithm is proposed, in which searching for the spots in sub image is done and the relevant information of the spot is extracted. The process is repeated for the entire image. This algorithm is novel as it is independent of the spot size, colour, and location. The code is developed using MATLAB and test is carried on oligonucleotide array. From the results it is observed that even low intensity spots can be determined accurately.","doi":"10.1109/IACSIT-SC.2009.59","startPage":"178","endPage":"181","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Association of Computer Science and Information Technology - Spring Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5169290/5169291/05169334.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 International Association of Computer Science and Information Technology - Spring Conference","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IACSIT-SC.2009.59","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5169291","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Automatically Locating Spots in DNAMicroarray Image Using Genetic Algorithm without Gridding","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Genetic algorithms","Image analysis","Data mining","Feature extraction","DNA","Cancer","Springs","Educational institutions","Genetic mutations","Fluorescence"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bioinformatics","DNA","genetic algorithms","genomics","lab-on-a-chip"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DNAMicroarray image","genetic algorithm","gridding","gene expression profiling","MATLAB"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["DNA microarray","gridding","genetic algorithms"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5169334/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"Automatically Locating Spots in DNAMicroarray Image Using Genetic Algorithm without Gridding","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5169334/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","dateOfInsertion":"21 July 2009","conferenceDate":"17-20 April 2009","accessionNumber":"10792152","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automatically Locating Spots in DNAMicroarray Image Using Genetic Algorithm without Gridding","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"3653a178.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065686S","chronDate":"17-20 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5169290","isNumber":"5169291","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5169290","xplore-issue":"5169291","articleId":"5169334","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5169368,"authors":[{"name":"Fan-Yong Liu","affiliation":["School of Finance and Economics, Xiasha Higher Education Zone, Hangzhou Dianzi University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China"],"firstName":"Fan-Yong","lastName":"Liu","id":"37631009100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3653-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5169368","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":95},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Exchange rates","Autocorrelation","Neural networks","Autoregressive processes","Economic forecasting","Predictive models","Signal resolution","Springs","Testing","Artificial neural networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["economic forecasting","exchange rates","financial data processing","neural nets","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["renminbi exchange rates","autocorrelation shell representation","neural networks","fluctuation range","forecasting models","wavelet decomposition","over-fitting problems","CNY/USD exchange rates market data","CNY/EUR exchange rates market data","CNY/100JPY exchange rates market data","CNY/GBP exchange rates market data","wavelet prediction scheme"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Forecasting","Renminbi Exchange Rates","Autocorrelation Shell Representation","Neural Networks"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5169368","abstract":"Since the implementation of the new mechanism of renminbi exchange rates in 2005, their fluctuation range has become more greater. Therefore, it is very important to control renminbi exchange rates risk via forecasting. This paper describes four alternative renminbi exchange rates forecasting models. These models are based on autocorrelation shell representation and neural networks techniques. An autocorrelation shell representation is used to reconstruct signals after wavelet decomposition. Neural networks are used to infer future renminbi exchange rates from the wavelets feature space. The individual wavelet domain forecasts are recombined by different techniques to form the accurate overall forecast. The proposed models have been tested with the CNY/USD, CNY/EUR, CNY/100JPY and CNY/GBP exchange rates market data. Experimental results show that wavelet prediction scheme has the best forecasting performance on testing dataset among four models, with regards to the least error values. Therefore, wavelet scheme outperforms the other three models and avoids effectively over-fitting problems.","doi":"10.1109/IACSIT-SC.2009.112","pdfPath":"/iel5/5169290/5169291/05169368.pdf","startPage":"331","endPage":"335","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Association of Computer Science and Information Technology - Spring Conference","publicationTitle":"2009 International Association of Computer Science and Information Technology - Spring Conference","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IACSIT-SC.2009.112","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5169291","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Forecasting Renminbi Exchange Rates Based on Autocorrelation Shell Representation and Neural Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5169368/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"Forecasting Renminbi Exchange Rates Based on Autocorrelation Shell Representation and Neural Networks","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"21 July 2009","accessionNumber":"10792186","publicationDate":"April 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5169368/","conferenceDate":"17-20 April 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Forecasting Renminbi Exchange Rates Based on Autocorrelation Shell Representation and Neural Networks","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"3653a331.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051397S","chronDate":"17-20 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5169290","isNumber":"5169291","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5169290","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5169291","articleId":"5169368","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5169393,"authors":[{"name":"Modjtaba Rouhani","affiliation":["Islamic Azad University, Gonabad branch, Gonabad, Iran"],"firstName":"Modjtaba","lastName":"Rouhani","id":"38558998900"},{"name":"Mehdi Motavalli Haghighi","affiliation":["Islamic Azad University, Gonabad branch, Gonabad, Iran"],"firstName":"Mehdi Motavalli","lastName":"Haghighi","id":"37586836700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3653-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5169393","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":267},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Support vector machines","Artificial neural networks","Support vector machine classification","Neurons","Neural networks","Statistical analysis","Computer science"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["medical diagnostic computing","patient diagnosis","radial basis function networks","regression analysis","support vector machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["disease diagnosis system","support vector machine","artificial neural network","disease type","disease phase","hepatitis B","hepatitis C","nonviral hepatitis","RBF","GRNN","PNN","LVQ","SVM","classification task","radial basis function","generalized regression neural network","probabilistic neural network","learning vector quantization network"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["hepatitis disease","PNN","LVQ","SVM","RBF","GRNN"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5169393","abstract":"In this paper, we use support vector machine (SVM) and artificial neural networks to diagnosis hepatitis diseases.

Before applying those features to neural networks, we reduce the order of feature space by generalized discriminate analysis (GDA).

The SPFs are computationally intensive and they exhibit spatial or temporal parallelism or both. While the high performance DSP processors are unable to meet the speed requirements of these SDRs, System on chips (SOCs) are also not suitable because of their limited flexibility. Recently, state-of-the-art FPGAs have emerged as high performance programmable hardware to execute highly parallel, computationally intensive signal processing functions because of the availability of in-built multiply and accumulate (MAC) units within these chips. Hence, FPGAs are becoming possible hardware platforms for implementing SDRs. Apart from that these FPGAs also include partial reconfiguration features that make them suitable for implementing SDRs efficiently as the configuration latency in run time trends to go down. This paper investigates the potential use of FPGAs for implementing efficient ldquoRadio Processorrdquo. The proposed Processor is based on a parallel re-configurable which was implemented on FPGA and exploits the spatial and temporal parallelism of the signal processing functions using a new concept ldquoReconfigurable Single Function Multiple Data (RSFMD)rdquo architecture.

The resource allocation scheme based on a bargaining model, which may be completed in a very short time, seems to be suitable for providing emergency services. A distributed call admission control algorithm exploiting the predictability of the satellite channel to guarantee quality of service (QoS) is also presented. According to the suggested scheme, each user unilaterally decides whether to accept a new call and, if all users unanimously agree, the new call is admitted. The performance of the proposed scheme is investigated using Markov chain modeling. Finally, analytical results concerning bounds for the call blocking probability and the system throughput are presented.","doi":"10.1109/TCIAIG.2009.2027693","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computational Intelligence and AI in Games","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computational Intelligence and AI in Games","pdfPath":"/iel5/4804728/5200752/05169832.pdf","startPage":"134","endPage":"144","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCIAIG.2009.2027693","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5200752","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed Resource Allocation for Delay-Sensitive Services in Satellite Networks Using Game Theory","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5169832/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 July 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2009","displayDocTitle":"Distributed Resource Allocation for Delay-Sensitive Services in Satellite Networks Using Game Theory","volume":"1","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10816388","dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed Resource Allocation for Delay-Sensitive Services in Satellite Networks Using Game Theory","sourcePdf":"tciaig-hchen-2027693.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.03786S","chronDate":"June  2009","isNumber":"5200752","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4804728","citationCount":"7","articleId":"5169832","onlineDate":"21 July 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5169834,"authors":[{"name":"Hyojin Choi","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Hyojin","lastName":"Choi","id":"37693587000"},{"name":"Wei Liu","affiliation":["Samsung Electronics Company Limited, Yongin si, South Korea","Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Liu","id":"37292307500"},{"name":"Wonyong Sung","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Wonyong","lastName":"Sung","id":"37290807000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-8210"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9999"}],"articleNumber":"5169834","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":58,"citationCountPatent":9,"totalDownloads":2842},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Solid-State Circuits Society","url":"http://www.sscs.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Very large scale integration","Error correction","Error correction codes","Energy consumption","Solid state circuits","Complexity theory","Algorithm design and analysis","Design optimization","Parallel algorithms","Resource management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["BCH codes","error correction codes","flash memories","NAND circuits","VLSI"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["VLSI design","Bose-Chaudhuri-Hocquenghem code","BCH error correction codes","multilevel cell NAND flash memory","solid-state drives","circuit complexity","architectural-level optimization","parallel algorithm transformation","resource sharing","time multiplexing"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Bose\u2013Chaudhuri\u2013Hocquenghem (BCH) code","memory error correction","nand Flash memory","solid-state drive (SSD)"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5169834","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/92/5453312/05169834.pdf","startPage":"843","endPage":"847","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVLSI.2009.2015666","doi":"10.1109/TVLSI.2009.2015666","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5453312","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"VLSI Implementation of BCH Error Correction for Multilevel Cell NAND Flash Memory","abstract":"Bit-error correction is crucial for realizing cost-effective and reliable NAND Flash-memory-based storage systems. In this paper, low-power and high-throughput error-correction circuits have been developed for multilevel cell (MLC) nand Flash memories. The developed circuits employ the Bose-Chaudhuri-Hocquenghem code to correct multiple random bit errors. The error-correcting codes for them are designed based on the bit-error characteristics of MLC NAND Flash memories for solid-state drives. To trade the code rate, circuit complexity, and power consumption, three error-correcting architectures, named as whole-page, sector-pipelined, and multistrip ones, are proposed. The VLSI design applies both algorithmic and architectural-level optimizations that include parallel algorithm transformation, resource sharing, and time multiplexing. The chip area, power consumption, and throughput results for these three architectures are presented.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5169834/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 July 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2010","volume":"18","issue":"5","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11260238","dateOfInsertion":"22 April 2010","publicationDate":"May 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5169834/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"VLSI Implementation of BCH Error Correction for Multilevel Cell NAND Flash Memory","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"VLSI Implementation of BCH Error Correction for Multilevel Cell NAND Flash Memory","sourcePdf":"tvlsi-choi-2015666.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.079684S","chronDate":"May  2010","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"5453312","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"58","xplore-issue":"5453312","articleId":"5169834","onlineDate":"21 July 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5169836,"authors":[{"name":"Saumya Chandra","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California, San Diego, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Saumya","lastName":"Chandra","id":"37557334300"},{"name":"Kanishka Lahiri","affiliation":["NEC Laboratories of America, Inc., Princeton, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Kanishka","lastName":"Lahiri","id":"37265025800"},{"name":"Anand Raghunathan","affiliation":["NEC Laboratories of America, Inc., Princeton, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Anand","lastName":"Raghunathan","id":"37275475300"},{"name":"Sujit Dey","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California, San Diego, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Sujit","lastName":"Dey","id":"37278573500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-8210"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9999"}],"articleNumber":"5169836","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":14,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":429},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Solid-State Circuits Society","url":"http://www.sscs.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Energy management","Power system management","Technology management","System-on-a-chip","Manufacturing processes","Design methodology","Fabrication","Displays","National electric code","Laboratories"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["logic design","system-on-chip"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["variation-tolerant dynamic power management","system-on-chip","nanoscale technologies","process variations","system-level power analysis","variation-aware power management","design-specific approach","chip-specific approach","policy parameters","ideal oracle-based framework","timeout-based framework","ARM946 processor core model","energy distribution"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Dynamic power management","process variations"]}],"abstract":"The power characteristics of system-on-chips (SoCs) in nanoscale technologies are significantly impacted by manufacturing process variations, making it important to consider these effects during system-level power analysis and optimization. In this paper, we identify and address the problem of designing effective power management schemes in the presence of such variations. In particular, we demonstrate that conventional power management schemes, which are designed without considering the impact of variations, can result in substantial power wastage. We therefore propose two approaches to variation-aware power management, namely, design-specific and chip-specific approaches. In each of these approaches, the goal is to consider the impact of variations while deriving power management policy parameters, in order to optimize metrics that are relevant under variations. We motivate and introduce these metrics, and present both exact and heuristic approaches to optimize them. The methods are designed and implemented in the context of two power management frameworks, namely an ideal oracle-based framework and a timeout-based framework. We experimentally evaluate the proposed ideas using an ARM946 processor core model. For the oracle-based framework, variation-aware power management can result in improvements of upto 59% for mu+sigma , and upto 55% for 95th percentile of the energy distribution, over conventional power management schemes that do not consider variations. For the timeout-based framework, we obtain reductions of upto 43% in mu+sigma and upto 55% in the 99th percentile of the energy distribution.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/92/5208586/05169836.pdf","startPage":"1220","endPage":"1232","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Variation-Tolerant Dynamic Power Management at the System-Level","doi":"10.1109/TVLSI.2009.2019803","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5208586","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVLSI.2009.2019803","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5169836","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5169836/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 July 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2009","displayDocTitle":"Variation-Tolerant Dynamic Power Management at the System-Level","dateOfInsertion":"18 August 2009","publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10828391","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"17","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Variation-Tolerant Dynamic Power Management at the System-Level","sourcePdf":"17tvlsi07-schandra-2019803.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.070515S","chronDate":"Sept.  2009","isNumber":"5208586","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"14","articleId":"5169836","onlineDate":"21 July 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5169840,"authors":[{"name":"Tse-Wei Chen","affiliation":["Media IC and System Laboratory, Graduate Institute of Electronics Engineering and Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/92/5471724/5169840/5169840-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Tse-Wei Chen received the B.S. degrees from the Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University (NTU), Taipei, in 2006.

Due to real-time requirements and computational-cost constraints in embedded systems, it is necessary to accelerate K-Means algorithm by hardware implementations in SoC environments, where the bandwidth of the system bus is strictly limited. In this paper, a bandwidth adaptive hardware architecture of K-Means clustering is proposed. Experiments show that the proposed hardware can be used in applications such as image segmentation, and it has the maximum clock speed 400-MHz and 440-K gate count with TSMC 90-nm technology. Moreover, the throughput of the proposed hardware reaches 16 dimension/cycle, and it can deal with feature vectors with different dimensions using five parallel modes to utilize the input bandwidth efficiently.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/92/5471724/05169840.pdf","startPage":"957","endPage":"966","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","doi":"10.1109/TVLSI.2009.2017543","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVLSI.2009.2017543","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5471724","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5169840","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bandwidth Adaptive Hardware Architecture of K-Means Clustering for Video Analysis","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bandwidth","Hardware","Computer architecture","Clustering algorithms","Pattern classification","Pattern analysis","Algorithm design and analysis","Real time systems","Embedded computing","Embedded system"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["embedded systems","image segmentation","pattern recognition","video signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bandwidth adaptive hardware architecture","K-means clustering","video analysis","pattern classification","multimedia analysis","embedded systems","SoC environments","image segmentation","clock speed","pattern recognition"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Clustering methods","hardware design","K-Means","parallel architectures","pattern recognition"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5169840/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 July 2009","displayDocTitle":"Bandwidth Adaptive Hardware Architecture of K-Means Clustering for Video Analysis","volume":"18","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/5169840/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2010","accessionNumber":"11308175","dateOfInsertion":"24 May 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bandwidth Adaptive Hardware Architecture of K-Means Clustering for Video Analysis","sourcePdf":"tvlsi-chien-2017543.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.072571S","chronDate":"June  2010","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"5471724","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"34","xplore-issue":"5471724","articleId":"5169840","onlineDate":"21 July 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5169868,"authors":[{"name":"Yu-Sheng Lu","affiliation":["Department of Mechatronic Technology, National Taiwan Normal University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yu-Sheng","lastName":"Lu","id":"37539053300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6536"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0865"},{"format":"CD","value":"2374-0159"}],"articleNumber":"5169868","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":407},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Control Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieeecss.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Lighting control","Finite impulse response filter","Optical filters","Band pass filters","Disk drives","Signal design","Transfer functions","Optical feedback","Control system synthesis","Optical control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["band-pass filters","closed loop systems","disc drives","optical disc storage","robust control","transfer functions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["lightly damped system","periodic exogenous signal","internal model control","IMC filter","closed loop transfer function","band pass filter","track following system","optical disk drive"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Bandpass filters","control systems","internal model control","lightly damped systems","optical disk drives","periodic exogenous signals"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5169868","doi":"10.1109/TCST.2009.2023672","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCST.2009.2023672","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5453284","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/87/5453284/05169868.pdf","startPage":"699","endPage":"704","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Internal Model Control of Lightly Damped Systems Subject to Periodic Exogenous Signals","abstract":"This paper presents an internal model control (IMC) design for lightly-damped systems subject to periodic exogenous signals. For such systems, the conventional design of the so-called IMC filter in the IMC structure can result in oscillatory behavior even when the closed-loop transfer function is designed to be well damped. To circumvent this problem, several band-pass filters are incorporated into the IMC filter based on knowledge of the frequencies of the plant's resonance modes and exogenous signals. The track-following system of an optical disk drive is employed to illustrate the design of the proposed IMC filter. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed design.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5169868/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 July 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5169868/","dateOfInsertion":"22 April 2010","publicationDate":"May 2010","accessionNumber":"11260214","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"18","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Internal Model Control of Lightly Damped Systems Subject to Periodic Exogenous Signals","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Internal Model Control of Lightly Damped Systems Subject to Periodic Exogenous Signals","sourcePdf":"tcst-ylu-2023672.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.042707S","chronDate":"May  2010","xplore-pub-id":"87","isNumber":"5453284","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"87","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"5453284","articleId":"5169868","onlineDate":"21 July 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-05"},{"_id":5169870,"authors":[{"name":"Fadi J.

Independent control of the branch amplifiers by two in-phase/quadrature modulators enables optimum outphasing and input power leveling, yielding significant improvements in gain, efficiency, and linearity. In deep-power backoff operation, the outphasing angle of the branch amplifiers is kept constant below a certain power level. This results in class-B operation for the very low output power levels, yielding less reactive loading of the output stages, and therefore, improved efficiency in power backoff operation compared to the classical outphasing amplifiers. Based on these principles, the optimum design parameters and input signal conditioning are discussed. The resulting theoretical maximum achievable average efficiency for W-CDMA signals is presented. Experimental results support the foregoing theory and show high efficiency over a large bandwidth, while meeting the linearity specifications using low-cost low-complexity memoryless pre-distortion. These properties make this amplifier concept an interesting candidate for future multiband base-station implementations.","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.2009.2025430","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel5/22/5200722/05169897.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.2009.2025430","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5200722","startPage":"1925","endPage":"1935","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 90-W Peak Power GaN Outphasing Amplifier With Optimum Input Signal Conditioning","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5169897","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A 90-W Peak Power GaN Outphasing Amplifier With Optimum Input Signal Conditioning","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5169897/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 July 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"57","issue":"8","publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","accessionNumber":"10816579","dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5169897/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 90-W Peak Power GaN Outphasing Amplifier With Optimum Input Signal Conditioning","sourcePdf":"tmtt-qureshi-2025430.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.080975S","chronDate":"Aug.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"5200722","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"91","xplore-issue":"5200722","articleId":"5169897","onlineDate":"21 July 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5169913,"authors":[{"name":"Qing-Jie Kong","affiliation":["Department of Automation, School of Electronic, Information, and Electrical Engineering, Shanghai Jiaotong University, Shanghai, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6979/5230362/5169913/5169913-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Qing-Jie Kong (S'07) received the B.S. degree in automation from Qingdao University of Science and Technology, Qingdao, China, in 2003 and the M.S. degree in control science and engineering from Shandong University, Jinan, China, in 2006.

The approach can fuse online data from underground loop detectors and global positioning system (GPS)-equipped probe vehicles to more accurately and completely obtain traffic state estimation than using either of them alone. In this approach, three parts of the algorithms are developed for fusion computing and the data processing of loop detectors and GPS probe vehicles. First, a fusion algorithm, which integrates the federated Kalman filter and evidence theory (ET), is proposed to prepare a robust, credible, and extensible fusion platform for the fusion of multisensor data. After that, a novel algorithm based on the traffic wave theory is employed to estimate the link mean speed using single-loop detectors buried at the end of links. With the GPS data, a series of technologies are combined with the geographic information systems for transportation (GIS-T) map to compute another link mean speed. These two speeds are taken as the inputs of the proposed fusion platform. Finally, tests on the accuracy, conflict resistance, robustness, and operation speed by real-world traffic data illustrate that the proposed approach can well be used in urban traffic applications on a large scale.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5169913/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 July 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10847380","volume":"10","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/5169913/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"01 September 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"An Approach to Urban Traffic State Estimation by Fusing Multisource Information","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Approach to Urban Traffic State Estimation by Fusing Multisource Information","sourcePdf":"tits-kong-2026308.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.108431S","chronDate":"Sept.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"6979","isNumber":"5230362","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6979","citationCount":"116","xplore-issue":"5230362","articleId":"5169913","onlineDate":"21 July 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":5169942,"authors":[{"name":"Robert G.

We propose a novel arrangement having EXIT functions that do not intersect before the (1, 1) point, which is typically associated with approaching the maximum-likelihood (ML) bit-error-ratio (BER) performance. Our method employs an inner recursive code that is terminated using specifically designed termination sequences, which have a minimum Hamming distance of at least two between each other. Additionally, we provide optimal termination sequences for a range of inner code designs. Finally, we demonstrate that our novel approach can facilitate useful BER reductions in the challenging application scenario when employing short frame lengths on the order of 100 bits, which are typical in wireless sensor networks, for example.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/5383378/05169942.pdf","startPage":"216","endPage":"224","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Iterative Decoding Convergence and Termination of Serially Concatenated Codes","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2009.2028118","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5383378","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2009.2028118","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5169942","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5169942/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 July 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2010","displayDocTitle":"Iterative Decoding Convergence and Termination of Serially Concatenated Codes","dateOfInsertion":"15 January 2010","publicationDate":"Jan. 2010","accessionNumber":"11070321","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"59","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/5169942/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Iterative Decoding Convergence and Termination of Serially Concatenated Codes","sourcePdf":"tvt-hanzo-2028118.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.10394S","chronDate":"Jan.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"5383378","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"5383378","articleId":"5169942","onlineDate":"21 July 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5169958,"authors":[{"name":"Edward Chu Yeow Peh","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Edward Chu Yeow","lastName":"Peh","id":"37294297800"},{"name":"Ying-Chang Liang","affiliation":["Institute for Infocomm Research, A*STAR, Singapore"],"firstName":"Ying-Chang","lastName":"Liang","id":"37275171800"},{"name":"Yong Liang Guan","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Yong Liang","lastName":"Guan","id":"37272208800"},{"name":"Yonghong Zeng","affiliation":["Institute for Infocomm Research, A*STAR, Singapore"],"firstName":"Yonghong","lastName":"Zeng","id":"37271453200"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9545"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1939-9359"}],"articleNumber":"5169958","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":336,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":3013},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Vehicular Technology Society","url":"http://www.vtsociety.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5169958","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cognitive radio","Throughput","Protection","Iterative algorithms","Computer simulation","Radio network","Data communication","Frequency","Error probability","Statistics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","iterative methods","optimisation","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimization","cognitive radio networks","spectrum sensing","fusion scheme","wireless channels","k -out-of-N fusion rule","iterative algorithm","computer simulations"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cognitive radio","cooperative sensing","sensing-throughput tradeoff"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TVT.2009.2028030","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/5307285/05169958.pdf","startPage":"5294","endPage":"5299","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2009.2028030","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5307285","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimization of Cooperative Sensing in Cognitive Radio Networks: A Sensing-Throughput Tradeoff View","abstract":"In cognitive radio networks, the performance of the spectrum sensing depends on the sensing time and the fusion scheme that are used when cooperative sensing is applied.

We have developed several area-efficient cryptographic IPs embedded in MIPsec to lower silicon cost. Thanks to structural regularity, the simple deterministic programming of MIPsec guarantees high utilization of the hardware. Also, both handshake and contention issues are solved in the scheme, such that performance can be scaled up. Specifically, the 6.23-million-gate MIPsec achieves 10-Gb/s wire speed for each routing direction.

Analysis allows for gaining an insight into the delay dependence on fan-in, fan-out, and sizing in sub-100-nm technologies. Simple but reasonably accurate models are derived to capture the basic dependences. The effect of process variations in transistor stacks is analytically modeled and analyzed in detail. The impact of both interdie and intradie variations is evaluated and discussed. Interestingly, the input capacitance of static and dynamic logic is shown to be rather insensitive to variations. The delay variability was also shown to be a weak function of the input rise/fall time and load. Analysis shows that domino logic circuits suffer from a doubled variability as compared to the static CMOS logic style. The positive feedback associated with the keeper transistor is shown to be responsible for the variability increase, which, in turn, limits the speed performance. This adds to the well-known speed degradation due to the current contention associated with the keeper transistor. Monte Carlo simulations on a 90-nm technology, including layout parasitics, are performed to validate the results.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5169967/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 July 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2010","volume":"18","issue":"5","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11260234","dateOfInsertion":"22 April 2010","publicationDate":"May 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5169967/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Understanding the Effect of Process Variations on the Delay of Static and Domino Logic","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Understanding the Effect of Process Variations on the Delay of Static and Domino Logic","sourcePdf":"tvlsi-malioto-2015455.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.149523S","chronDate":"May  2010","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"5453312","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"133","xplore-issue":"5453312","articleId":"5169967","onlineDate":"21 July 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5169969,"authors":[{"name":"Mao-Yin Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/92/5437466/5169969/5169969-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Mao-Yin Wang received the B.S. degree from the Department of Electronic Engineering, National Kaohsiung University of Applied Sciences, Kaohsiung, Taiwan, in 2001.

Information security issues add to the need for developing high-performance network processing hardware, particularly that for real-time processing of cryptographic algorithms. This paper presents a configurable architecture for Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) encryption, whose major building blocks are a group of AES processors. Each AES processor provides 2\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">19</sup>\n block cipher schemes with a novel on-the-fly key expansion design for the original AES algorithm and an extended AES algorithm. In this multicore architecture, the memory controller of each AES processor is designed for the maximum overlapping between data transfer and encryption, reducing interrupt handling load of the host processor. This design can be applied to high-speed systems since its independent data paths greatly reduces the input/output bandwidth problem. A test chip has been fabricated for the AES architecture, using a standard 0.25-\u00bfm CMOS process. It has a silicon area of 6.29 mm\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n, containing about 200,500 logic gates, and runs at a 66-MHz clock.

In order to achieve 1-Gb/s throughput (including overhead) at the worst case, we design a multicore architecture containing three AES processors with 0.18-\u00bfm CMOS process. The throughput rate of the architecture is between 1.29 and 3.75 Gb/s at 102 MHz. The architecture performs encryption and decryption of large data with 128-b key in CBC mode using on-the-fly key generation and composite field S-box, making it more cost effective (with better thousand-gate/gigabit-per-second ratio) than conventional methods.","doi":"10.1109/TVLSI.2009.2013231","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/92/5437466/05169969.pdf","startPage":"541","endPage":"552","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVLSI.2009.2013231","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5437466","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Single- and Multi-core Configurable AES Architectures for Flexible Security","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5169969/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 July 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2010","displayDocTitle":"Single- and Multi-core Configurable AES Architectures for Flexible Security","volume":"18","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 2010","accessionNumber":"11204176","htmlLink":"/document/5169969/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"22 March 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Single- and Multi-core Configurable AES Architectures for Flexible Security","sourcePdf":"tvlsi-mwang-2013231.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.111301S","chronDate":"April  2010","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"5437466","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"47","xplore-issue":"5437466","articleId":"5169969","onlineDate":"21 July 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5169973,"authors":[{"name":"Mart\u00cdn Casado","affiliation":["University of Stanford, Stanford, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/90/5208599/5169973/5169973-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Mart\u00edn Casado (S'99) received the Ph.D. degree from Stanford University, Stanford, CA, in 2007.","At Stanford, he was a DHS Fellow and was awarded the IBM research fellowship.

Ethane allows managers to define a single network-wide fine-grain policy and then enforces it directly. Ethane couples extremely simple flow-based Ethernet switches with a centralized controller that manages the admittance and routing of flows. While radical, this design is backwards-compatible with existing hosts and switches. We have implemented Ethane in both hardware and software, supporting both wired and wireless hosts.

The approach is based on perturbing the elements of the residue matrices with the perturbed residue matrix eigenvalues as free variables. This gives large savings for the CPU time and memory requirements. The implementation does not require sparse computations. Combining the passivity enforcement step with iterations and fast passivity assessment via a half-size test matrix gives a globally passive model. Error control strategies are implemented via least squares weighting. The approach is demonstrated for a two-port microwave filter, a four-port interconnect, a 48-port low-order package model, and a 28-port high-order package model.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 July 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5169974/","volume":"33","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/5169974/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11152970","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"01 March 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Fast Passivity Enforcement for <emphasis emphasistype=\"italic\">S</emphasis>-Parameter Models by Perturbation of Residue Matrix Eigenvalues","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast Passivity Enforcement for <emphasis emphasistype=\"italic\">S</emphasis>-Parameter Models by Perturbation of Residue Matrix Eigenvalues","sourcePdf":"tadvp-bgustavsen-2010508.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.096065S","chronDate":"Feb.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"6040","isNumber":"5423263","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6040","citationCount":"48","xplore-issue":"5423263","articleId":"5169974","onlineDate":"21 July 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5169976,"authors":[{"name":"Fabiano Salvadori","affiliation":["Department of Technology, Universidade Regional do Noroeste do Estado do Rio Grande do Sul, Ijui, Brazil"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/19/5200743/5169976/5169976-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Fabiano Salvadori (S'95\u2013M'00) was born in Tapera, Brazil, in 1962.

The system is based on two hardware topologies responsible for signal acquisition, processing, and transmission: intelligent sensor modules (ISMs) and remote data acquisition units (RDAUs). The gateway function of the wired network is carried out by remote servers (RSs) based on the \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Soekris</i>\n architecture, which is responsible for receiving the data collected and transmitting it to the supervisory controller (SC). To extend the WSN lifetime, sensor nodes implement a DPM protocol. The basic characteristics of the presented system are the following: 1) easy implementation; 2) low-cost implementation; 3) easy implementation of redundant routines (security); 4) portability/versatility; and 5) extended network lifetime.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Monitoring","Wireless sensor networks","Energy management","Power system management","Supervisory control","SCADA systems","Electrical equipment industry","Wireless communication","Microelectronics","Communication system control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["condition monitoring","data acquisition","signal detection","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["industrial systems","wireless sensor network","dynamic power management","wireless communication","microelectronics","digital electronics","highly integrated electronics","supervisory control","energy usage evaluation","condition monitoring","signal acquisition","signal processing","signal transmission","intelligent sensor modules","remote data acquisition units","remote servers","Soekris architecture","DPM protocol"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Dynamic power management (DPM)","monitoring of industrial systems","supervisory control","wireless sensor network (WSN)"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TIM.2009.2016882","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","pdfPath":"/iel5/19/5200743/05169976.pdf","startPage":"3104","endPage":"3111","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5200743","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIM.2009.2016882","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Monitoring in Industrial Systems Using Wireless Sensor Network With Dynamic Power Management","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5169976","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Monitoring in Industrial Systems Using Wireless Sensor Network With Dynamic Power Management","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5169976/","volume":"58","issue":"9","publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5169976/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"10816361","dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 July 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Monitoring in Industrial Systems Using Wireless Sensor Network With Dynamic Power Management","sourcePdf":"tim-salvadori-2016882.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.151781S","chronDate":"Sept.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"19","isNumber":"5200743","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"19","citationCount":"108","xplore-issue":"5200743","articleId":"5169976","onlineDate":"21 July 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-05"},{"_id":5169977,"authors":[{"name":"Erich Fuchs","affiliation":["Faculty of Informatics and Mathematics, University of Passau, Passau, Germany"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/72/5230374/5169977/5169977-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Erich Fuchs received the Diploma in computer science from the University of the Armed Forces, Munich, Germany, in 1984 and the Ph.D. degree in computer science from the University of Passau, Passau, Germany, in 1999.","Currently, he is Managing Director of the Institute for Software Systems in Technical Applications, University of Passau.

In many cases, time series contain short-term and long-term trends or behavior. This paper presents a new approach to capture temporal information with various reference periods simultaneously. A least squares approximation of the time series with orthogonal polynomials will be used to describe short-term trends contained in a signal (average, increase, curvature, etc.). Long-term behavior will be modeled with the tapped delay lines of a time-delay neural network (TDNN). This network takes the coefficients of the orthogonal expansion of the approximating polynomial as inputs such considering short-term and long-term information efficiently. The advantages of the method will be demonstrated by means of artificial data and two real-world application examples, the prediction of the user number in a computer network and online tool wear classification in turning.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5169977/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 July 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10847525","pubMedId":"19628457","volume":"20","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/5169977/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"01 September 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Processing Short-Term and Long-Term Information With a Combination of Polynomial Approximation Techniques and Time-Delay Neural Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Processing Short-Term and Long-Term Information With a Combination of Polynomial Approximation Techniques and Time-Delay Neural Networks","sourcePdf":"tnn-sick-2024679.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.088316S","chronDate":"Sept.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"72","isNumber":"5230374","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"5230374","articleId":"5169977","onlineDate":"21 July 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5169983,"authors":[{"name":"Wei-Liang Lin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Chung Hsing University, Taichung, Taiwan"],"bio":{"p":["Wei-Liang Lin received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electrical engineering from National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan, in 1985 and 1987, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in computer science from Northwestern University, Evanston, IL, in 1995.","He worked at the IBM T.

Second, we examine the statistical properties of traffic flow volume time series. We show that the fluctuations of traffic flow are Gaussian type and that principal component analysis (PCA) can be used to retrieve the features of traffic flow. Third, we discuss how to use a robust PCA to filter out the abnormal traffic flow data that disturb the imputation process. Finally, we recall the theories of PPCA/Bayesian PCA-based imputation algorithms and compare their performance with some conventional methods, including the nearest/mean historical imputation methods and the local interpolation/regression methods. The experiments prove that the PPCA method provides significantly better performance than the conventional methods, reducing the root-mean-square imputation error by at least 25%.","doi":"10.1109/TITS.2009.2026312","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/6979/5230362/05169998.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TITS.2009.2026312","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5230362","startPage":"512","endPage":"522","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"PPCA-Based Missing Data Imputation for Traffic Flow Volume: A Systematical Approach","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5169998","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"PPCA-Based Missing Data Imputation for Traffic Flow Volume: A Systematical Approach","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5169998/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 July 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"10","issue":"3","publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10847393","dateOfInsertion":"01 September 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5169998/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"PPCA-Based Missing Data Imputation for Traffic Flow Volume: A Systematical Approach","sourcePdf":"tits-li-2026312.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.08099S","chronDate":"Sept.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"6979","isNumber":"5230362","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6979","citationCount":"180","xplore-issue":"5230362","articleId":"5169998","onlineDate":"21 July 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"}]
