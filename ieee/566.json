For this purpose, five PM machines are designed and the electromagnetic, thermal, and mechanical designs of each machine are simultaneously performed. The critical values of the thermal and mechanical constraints are considered in order to obtain the maximum powers of the electrical machines. The electromagnetic losses generated in the machine are the output parameters of the electromagnetic design and input parameters for the thermal design. The thermal design is performed using a multiphysics method, which couples computational-fluid-dynamics equations with heat-transfer equations. The mechanical design considers the retention of the rotor elements against the huge centrifugal forces that arise during the high-speed operation and also the rotor dynamics properties of the rotor. The reliability of these design techniques is experimentally validated in the paper. The obtained maximum-power limit defines the speed-power region, in which the high-speed PM electrical machines intended for compressor applications can have a safe operation.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Geoscience"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5660074/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 December 2010","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"11832597","volume":"26","issue":"1","publicationDate":"March 2011","dateOfInsertion":"17 February 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Power Limits of High-Speed Permanent-Magnet Electrical Machines for Compressor Applications","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power Limits of High-Speed Permanent-Magnet Electrical Machines for Compressor Applications","sourcePdf":"tec-kolondzovski-2089459-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.054512S","chronDate":"March  2011","isNumber":"5714224","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"60","citationCount":"93","articleId":"5660074","onlineDate":"10 December 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-26"},{"_id":5660075,"authors":[{"name":"Ahmed Sayed-Ahmed","affiliation":["Rockwell Automation, Mequon, WI, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/60/5768117/5660075/5660075-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ahmed Sayed-Ahmed (S'05\u2013M'09) received the B.Sc. and M.Sc. degree in electrical engineering in 1998 and 2003, respectively, from Cairo University, Cairo, Egypt, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from Marquette University, Milwaukee, WI, in 2009.","From 1999 to 2005, he was with the oil and gas industry where he was a Senior Electrical Engineer.

The surface quality of a solar wafer critically determines the conversion efficiency of the solar cell. A multicrystalline solar wafer contains random grain structures and results in a heterogeneous texture in the sensed image, which makes the defect detection task extremely difficult. Mean-shift technique that moves each data point to the mode of the data based on a kernel density estimator is applied for detecting subtle defects in a complicated background. Since the grain edges enclosed in a small spatial window in the solar wafer show more consistent edge directions and a defect region presents a high variation of edge directions, the entropy of gradient directions in a small neighborhood window is initially calculated to convert the gray-level image into an entropy image. The mean-shift smoothing procedure is then performed on the entropy image to remove noise and defect-free grain edges. The preserved edge points in the filtered image can then be easily identified as defective ones by a simple adaptive threshold. Experimental results have shown the proposed method performs effectively for detecting fingerprint and contamination defects in solar wafer surfaces.","doi":"10.1109/TII.2010.2092783","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TII.2010.2092783","startPage":"125","endPage":"135","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics","pdfPath":"/iel5/9424/5709247/05660082.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5709247","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Mean Shift-Based Defect Detection in Multicrystalline Solar Wafer Surfaces","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 December 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2011","displayDocTitle":"Mean Shift-Based Defect Detection in Multicrystalline Solar Wafer Surfaces","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"04 February 2011","volume":"7","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5660082/","accessionNumber":"11793748","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5660082/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mean Shift-Based Defect Detection in Multicrystalline Solar Wafer Surfaces","sourcePdf":"tii-tsai-2092783-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.138742S","chronDate":"Feb.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"9424","isNumber":"5709247","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9424","citationCount":"77","xplore-issue":"5709247","articleId":"5660082","onlineDate":"10 December 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-07"},{"_id":5660086,"authors":[{"name":"M.

While a number of other anatomical structures contribute to the process of vision, this review focuses on retinal imaging and image analysis. Following a brief overview of the most prevalent causes of blindness in the industrialized world that includes age-related macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy, and glaucoma, the review is devoted to retinal imaging and image analysis methods and their clinical implications. Methods for 2-D fundus imaging and techniques for 3-D optical coherence tomography (OCT) imaging are reviewed. Special attention is given to quantitative techniques for analysis of fundus photographs with a focus on clinically relevant assessment of retinal vasculature, identification of retinal lesions, assessment of optic nerve head (ONH) shape, building retinal atlases, and to automated methods for population screening for retinal diseases. A separate section is devoted to 3-D analysis of OCT images, describing methods for segmentation and analysis of retinal layers, retinal vasculature, and 2-D/3-D detection of symptomatic exudate-associated derangements, as well as to OCT-based analysis of ONH morphology and shape. Throughout the paper, aspects of image acquisition, image analysis, and clinical relevance are treated together considering their mutually interlinked relationships.","doi":"10.1109/RBME.2010.2084567","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RBME.2010.2084567","startPage":"169","endPage":"208","publicationTitle":"IEEE Reviews in Biomedical Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Reviews in Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/4664312/5656443/05660089.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5656443","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Retinal Imaging and Image Analysis","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5660089/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 December 2010","displayDocTitle":"Retinal Imaging and Image Analysis","volume":"3","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2010","accessionNumber":"11692936","pubMedId":"22275207","publicationDate":"2010","htmlLink":"/document/5660089/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Retinal Imaging and Image Analysis","sourcePdf":"rbme-sonka-2084567-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.365075S","chronDate":"2010","xplore-pub-id":"4664312","isNumber":"5656443","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4664312","citationCount":"608","xplore-issue":"5656443","articleId":"5660089","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-24"},{"_id":5660111,"authors":[{"name":"Shu-Fang Zhao","affiliation":["Institute of Computer Science and Technology, Taiyuan University of Science and Technology, Taiyuan, Shanxi, China"],"firstName":"Shu-Fang","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37601181600"},{"name":"Li-Chao Chen","affiliation":["Institute of Computer Science and Technology, Taiyuan University of Science and Technology, Taiyuan, Shanxi, China"],"firstName":"Li-Chao","lastName":"Chen","id":"37599647300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7161-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7159-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-7160-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5660111","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":37},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5660111","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Safety","Monitoring","Artificial neural networks","Security","Condition monitoring","Training","Predictive models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["backpropagation","computerised monitoring","neural nets","occupational safety","production engineering computing","production equipment"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["backpropagation neural network","colliery equipment safety","safety monitoring","multiindex comprehensive monitoring","security early warning network model"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICEEE.2010.5660111","pdfPath":"/iel5/5660084/5660092/05660111.pdf","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on E-Product E-Service and E-Entertainment","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on E-Product E-Service and E-Entertainment","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5660092","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICEEE.2010.5660111","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Application of the Integrated Indicators Based on BP Neural Network in Colliery Equipment Safety Monitoring","abstract":"For the current problems in the security situation of colliery equipment ,and based on non-linear relationship among the parameters of colliery equipment ,this paper presents a method for forecasting the safety of colliery equipment based on BP neural network.By using BP neural network in the colliery safety equipment monitoring and warning issues,we established a multi-index comprehensive monitoring (evaluation) of the device security early warning network model,and have trained and tested the model which is used the measured data as an example.The results show that the network performance good and prediction accuracy is high and user-friendly .

Aim at handling weakness of poor convergence and insufficient forecast, an improved fuzzy neural network method based on SOFM (self-organizing feature map) and GA (genetic algorithm) was proposed to replace the fashionable T-S fuzzy neural network. The method illustrated how to apply SOFM and GA to improve the fault such as poor convergence and insufficient forecast. After optimizing of T-S fuzzy neural network model, construct project cost estimate model had been built up. Finally, the model was set up with the purpose of comparing generalization ability by 18 examples and 2 testing samples. Comparing the simulation, a positive result was found that genetic fuzzy neural network had a better performance in reducing the forecast error and iterating times than BP, BP optimized by GA, GA-BP, fuzzy neural work. Therefore, this model is fit for handling construct project cost estimate.","doi":"10.1109/ICEEE.2010.5660115","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on E-Product E-Service and E-Entertainment","pdfPath":"/iel5/5660084/5660092/05660115.pdf","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on E-Product E-Service and E-Entertainment","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICEEE.2010.5660115","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5660092","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Application of Genetic Fuzzy Neural Network in Project Cost Estimate","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fuzzy neural networks","Genetics","Gallium","Artificial neural networks","Training","Accuracy","Buildings"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["civil engineering computing","construction industry","costing","fuzzy neural nets","genetic algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic fuzzy neural network","project cost estimation","self-organizing feature map","genetic algorithm","construct project"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5660115/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 Nov. 2010","displayDocTitle":"The Application of Genetic Fuzzy Neural Network in Project Cost Estimate","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5660115/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2010","conferenceDate":"7-9 Nov. 2010","accessionNumber":"11701375","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Application of Genetic Fuzzy Neural Network in Project Cost Estimate","confLoc":"Henan, China","sourcePdf":"03-01-095.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038661S","chronDate":"7-9 Nov. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5660084","isNumber":"5660092","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5660084","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5660092","articleId":"5660115","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":5660842,"authors":[{"name":"Wang Xin","firstName":"Wang","lastName":"Xin"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7161-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7159-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-7160-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5660842","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":465},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Tunneling magnetoresistance","Field programmable gate arrays","Redundancy","Single event upset","Logic gates","Integrated circuit reliability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","logic circuits","logic partitioning","redundancy","SRAM chips"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["triple modular redundancy","single event upset mitigation","field programmable gate arrays","static random access memory","SRAM","logic circuits","TMR insertion","FPGA logic paths","logic partition"]}],"abstract":"The mitigation of single event upsets (SEUs) in field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) is an increasingly important subject as both the static random access memory (SRAM) cells and the logic circuits in FPGAs are susceptible to SEUs. Among all SEU mitigation techniques, the triple modular redundancy (TMR) has become the most common practice because of its straightforward implementation and reliable results. The methodologies to perform partitioning TMR insertion to reduce SEUs in the FPGA logic paths are presented in this paper. It is proved that the maximal probability of two simultaneous errors decreases dramatically with the number of logic partitions in the TMR designs. It is reduced from 66.67% for minimum logic partition to 4.44% for maximum logic partition for the test circuit. The results presented in this paper suggest that there is a tradeoff between the number of logic partitions and combination property of TMR designs. For ground-based systems such as nuclear power plant (NPPs), where the overhead is insignificant, especially compared to reliability requirements, the maximum partition can be the best. While in space applications where area is at a premium, the optimal logic partition should be the medium partition.","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on E-Product E-Service and E-Entertainment","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on E-Product E-Service and E-Entertainment","pdfPath":"/iel5/5660084/5660092/05660842.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Partitioning Triple Modular Redundancy for Single Event Upset Mitigation in FPGA","doi":"10.1109/ICEEE.2010.5660842","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5660092","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICEEE.2010.5660842","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5660842","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5660842/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 Nov. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Partitioning Triple Modular Redundancy for Single Event Upset Mitigation in FPGA","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2010","publicationDate":"Nov. 2010","accessionNumber":"11702099","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"7-9 Nov. 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5660842/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Partitioning Triple Modular Redundancy for Single Event Upset Mitigation in FPGA","confLoc":"Henan, China","sourcePdf":"05-05-027.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067491S","chronDate":"7-9 Nov. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5660084","isNumber":"5660092","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5660084","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5660092","articleId":"5660842","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5660859,"authors":[{"name":"Lei Tang","firstName":"Lei","lastName":"Tang"},{"name":"Xuan Zhou","firstName":"Xuan","lastName":"Zhou"},{"name":"Yao Wu","firstName":"Yao","lastName":"Wu"},{"name":"Jincheng Li","firstName":"Jincheng","lastName":"Li"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7161-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7159-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-7160-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5660859","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":436},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Flash memory","Timing","Control systems","Software","Clocks","Random access memory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","flash memories","microprocessor chips"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["flash controller","FPGA","field programmable gate array","reorganization method","mapping method","flash memory chip"]}],"abstract":"This paper designs a Flash controller, which helps the FPGA main state-machine to manage a Flash memory chip efficiently.

Multiobjective PPS problems become more complex because the decision maker need to make a trade-off between two or more objectives while determining a set of optimal nondominated solutions effectively. The previous research works use evolutionary algorithms (EA) to solve such problems, however, the proposed approaches cannot get a good balance between efficacy and efficiency. This paper proposed an improved vector evaluated genetic algorithm with archive (iVEGA-A) mechanism to deal with PPS problem while considering the minimization of the makespan and minimization of the variation of workload of machine. The proposed algorithm has been compared with other approaches to verify and benchmark the optimization reliability on PPS problems. These comparisons indicate iVEGA-A is better than vector evaluated genetic algorithm (VEGA) did on efficacy and negligible difference on efficiency. The efficacy is not less than some famous approaches, such as, nondominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II) and strength Pareto evolutionary algorithm 2 (SPEA2) and the efficiency is obviously better than the latter.","doi":"10.1109/ICEEE.2010.5660926","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on E-Product E-Service and E-Entertainment","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICEEE.2010.5660926","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5660092","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on E-Product E-Service and E-Entertainment","pdfPath":"/iel5/5660084/5660092/05660926.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improved Vector Evaluated Genetic Algorithm with Archive for Solving Multiobjective PPS Problem","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5660926/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Improved Vector Evaluated Genetic Algorithm with Archive for Solving Multiobjective PPS Problem","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5660926/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11701012","publicationDate":"Nov. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2010","conferenceDate":"7-9 Nov. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 Nov. 2010","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improved Vector Evaluated Genetic Algorithm with Archive for Solving Multiobjective PPS Problem","confLoc":"Henan, China","sourcePdf":"02-01-042.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.092178S","chronDate":"7-9 Nov. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5660084","isNumber":"5660092","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5660084","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5660092","articleId":"5660926","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5660941,"authors":[{"name":"Mao-rui Zhang","firstName":"Mao-rui","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37539177800"},{"name":"Yong Sun","firstName":"Yong","lastName":"Sun","id":"37089087591"},{"name":"Jian-fei Li","firstName":"Jian-fei","lastName":"Li","id":"37598892300"},{"name":"Da-wei Yang","firstName":"Da-wei","lastName":"Yang","id":"37601257400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7161-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7159-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-7160-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5660941","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":126},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optimization","Biological cells","Laser modes","Sun","Missiles"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive systems","genetic algorithms","laser beam applications","missile control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["improved genetic algorithm application","laser anti missile systems","average optimal time","adaptive genetic algorithm"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5660941","abstract":"This paper proposes a improved Genetic algorithm used in anti-missile systems, which is verified more efficient than the ordinary method.

In this paper, a new scheme to prejudge the down-sampling direction for the asymmetric stereoscopic coding is proposed. The sum of absolute transformed difference(SATD) of 16\u00d716 macroblocks intra-predicated vertically and horizontally in the left-view image are calculated so as to judge the relativities in vertical and horizontal directions. Finally, the direction with higher relativity is chosen as the down-sampling direction for right-view images.

A new evaluation function including the system adjusting time, rise time, over-shoot, and system error is defined. A group of parameters of the PID controller that minimize the evaluation function is calculated rapidly by searching in the given controller parameters area.

First, the reference model of flux identification should be established according to induction motor u-n mathematical model under the static coordinate system. Then, a RBF neural network can be constructed on this basis. After self-organization learning, on-line identification of stator flux can be realized in the RBF neural network.

Before the construction the image, use neural network in place of other coding method to code the coefficients in the wavelet packet domain. By using the Kohonen's neural network algorithm, not only for its vector quantization feature, but also for its topological property. This property allows an increase of about 80% for the compression rate. Compared to the JPEG standard, this compression scheme shows better performances (in terms of PSNR) for compression rates higher than 30. This method can get big compression ratio and perfect PSNR. Results show that the image can be compressed greatly and the original image can be recovered well.

The method uses the energy of the established match between a pair of images as a measure of goodness-of-match. The method can tolerate moderate global spatial transformations between the gallery and the test images and alleviate the need for geometric preprocessing of facial images by encapsulating a registration step as part of the system. It requires no training on nonfrontal face images. A number of innovations, such as a dynamic block size and block shape adaptation, as well as label pruning and error prewhitening measures have been introduced to increase the effectiveness of the approach. The experimental evaluation of the method is performed on two publicly available databases. First, the method is tested on the rotation shots of the XM2VTS data set in a verification scenario. Next, the evaluation is conducted in an identification scenario on the CMU-PIE database. The method compares favorably with the existing 2D or 3D generative model-based methods on both databases in both identification and verification scenarios.","doi":"10.1109/TPAMI.2010.209","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel5/34/5751894/05661778.pdf","startPage":"1274","endPage":"1280","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.2010.209","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5751894","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy Normalization for Pose-Invariant Face Recognition Based on MRF Model Image Matching","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5661778","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 December 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5661778/","displayDocTitle":"Energy Normalization for Pose-Invariant Face Recognition Based on MRF Model Image Matching","volume":"33","issue":"6","publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"11960548","pubMedId":"21135436","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5661778/","dateOfInsertion":"19 April 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy Normalization for Pose-Invariant Face Recognition Based on MRF Model Image Matching","sourcePdf":"ttp2011061274.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.093128S","chronDate":"June  2011","xplore-pub-id":"34","isNumber":"5751894","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"44","xplore-issue":"5751894","articleId":"5661778","onlineDate":"10 December 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-22"},{"_id":5661783,"authors":[{"name":"Yang Wang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, IL, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/34/5770288/5661783/5661783-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yang Wang received the BSc degree from the Harbin Institute of Technology, China, the MSc degree from the University of Alberta, Canada, and the PhD degree from Simon Fraser University, Canada, all in computer science.

Our model is based on the recently proposed hidden conditional random field (HCRF) for object recognition. Similarly to HCRF for object recognition, we model a human action by a flexible constellation of parts conditioned on image observations. Differently from object recognition, our model combines both large-scale global features and local patch features to distinguish various actions. Our experimental results show that our model is comparable to other state-of-the-art approaches in action recognition. In particular, our experimental results demonstrate that combining large-scale global features and local patch features performs significantly better than directly applying HCRF on local patches alone. We also propose an alternative for learning the parameters of an HCRF model in a max-margin framework. We call this method the max-margin hidden conditional random field (MMHCRF). We demonstrate that MMHCRF outperforms HCRF in human action recognition. In addition, MMHCRF can handle a much broader range of complex hidden structures arising in various problems in computer vision.","doi":"10.1109/TPAMI.2010.214","pdfPath":"/iel5/34/5770288/05661783.pdf","startPage":"1310","endPage":"1323","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.2010.214","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5770288","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hidden Part Models for Human Action Recognition: Probabilistic versus Max Margin","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5661783/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 December 2010","displayDocTitle":"Hidden Part Models for Human Action Recognition: Probabilistic versus Max Margin","volume":"33","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2011","accessionNumber":"12007000","pubMedId":"21135448","publicationDate":"July 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5661783/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hidden Part Models for Human Action Recognition: Probabilistic versus Max Margin","sourcePdf":"ttp2011071310.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.16851S","chronDate":"July  2011","xplore-pub-id":"34","isNumber":"5770288","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"124","xplore-issue":"5770288","articleId":"5661783","onlineDate":"10 December 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":5661789,"authors":[{"name":"Ran He","affiliation":["National Laboratory of Pattern Recognition, Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy and Sciences, Beijing, China","School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Dalian University of Technology, Dalian, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/34/5898466/5661789/5661789-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ran He received the BS degree in computer science from the Dalian University of Technology of China and the PhD degree in pattern recognition and intelligent system from the Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences, in 2009.

In order to develop a more tractable and practical approach, we in particular impose nonnegativity constraint on the variables in the maximum correntropy criterion and develop a half-quadratic optimization technique to approximately maximize the objective function in an alternating way so that the complex optimization problem is reduced to learning a sparse representation through a weighted linear least squares problem with nonnegativity constraint at each iteration. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method is more robust and efficient in dealing with the occlusion and corruption problems in face recognition as compared to the related state-of-the-art methods. In particular, it shows that the proposed method can improve both recognition accuracy and receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curves, while the computational cost is much lower than the SRC algorithms.","doi":"10.1109/TPAMI.2010.220","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.2010.220","startPage":"1561","endPage":"1576","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel5/34/5898466/05661789.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5898466","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Maximum Correntropy Criterion for Robust Face Recognition","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5661789/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 December 2010","displayDocTitle":"Maximum Correntropy Criterion for Robust Face Recognition","volume":"33","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"20 June 2011","accessionNumber":"12063304","pubMedId":"21135440","publicationDate":"Aug. 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5661789/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Maximum Correntropy Criterion for Robust Face Recognition","sourcePdf":"ttp2011081561.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.174034S","chronDate":"Aug.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"34","isNumber":"5898466","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"410","xplore-issue":"5898466","articleId":"5661789","onlineDate":"10 December 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5661800,"authors":[{"name":"Yuri \u00c1lvarez L\u00f3pez","affiliation":["\u00c1rea de Teor\u00eda de la Se\u00f1al y Comunicaciones, Departamento de Ingenier\u00eda El\u00e9ctrica, Universidad de Oviedo, Gij\u00f3n, Spain"],"firstName":"Yuri","lastName":"\u00c1lvarez L\u00f3pez","id":"38517939300"},{"name":"Ar\u00e1nzazu Dom\u00ednguez-Casas","affiliation":["European Space Research and Technology Centre (ESTEC), European Space Agency.

Most current approaches (at least for English) employ data-driven methods to learn and represent pronunciation \u201crules\u201d using statistical models such as decision trees, hidden Markov models (HMMs) or joint-multigram models (JMMs). The LTS task remains challenging, particularly for languages with a complex relationship between spelling and pronunciation such as English. In this paper, we propose to use a conditional random field (CRF) to perform LTS because it avoids having to model a distribution over observations and can perform global inference, suggesting that it may be more suitable for LTS than decision trees, HMMs or JMMs. One challenge in applying CRFs to LTS is that the phoneme and grapheme sequences of a word are generally of different lengths, which makes CRF training difficult. To solve this problem, we employed a joint-multigram model to generate aligned training exemplars. Experiments conducted with the AMI05 dictionary demonstrate that a CRF significantly outperforms other models, especially if n-best lists of predictions are generated.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5672529","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LSP.2010.2098440","publicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/97/5672529/05661808.pdf","startPage":"122","endPage":"125","doi":"10.1109/LSP.2010.2098440","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Letter-to-Sound Pronunciation Prediction Using Conditional Random Fields","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2011","displayDocTitle":"Letter-to-Sound Pronunciation Prediction Using Conditional Random Fields","volume":"18","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/5661808/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2011","accessionNumber":"11725950","dateOfInsertion":"30 December 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5661808/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 December 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Letter-to-Sound Pronunciation Prediction Using Conditional Random Fields","sourcePdf":"lsp-wang-2098440-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.05886S","chronDate":"Feb.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"97","isNumber":"5672529","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"97","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"5672529","articleId":"5661808","onlineDate":"10 December 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":5661811,"authors":[{"name":"Meng-Fan Chang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Meng-Fan","lastName":"Chang","id":"37420875800"},{"name":"Yung-Chi Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yung-Chi","lastName":"Chen","id":"37600583000"},{"name":"Chien-Fu Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chien-Fu","lastName":"Chen","id":"37600154400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1549-7747"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-3791"}],"articleNumber":"5661811","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":13,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":775},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5661811","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["SRAM chips","Arrays","Delay","Stability analysis","Transistors","Inverters","Low voltage"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["SRAM chips"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["expanded write/read stability","speed-area-wise array","read-stability issue","static RAM cell","write-assist circuit","supply voltage operation","hybrid-divided-block array","read-and-write stability","flowthrough SRAM macro","random access operation","voltage 0.45 V","frequency 300 MHz","size 90 nm","voltage 240 mV","voltage 0.5 V"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Flowthrough","low voltage","read disturb","static random access memory (SRAM)","write margin (WM)"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TCSII.2010.2083130","endPage":"985","startPage":"980","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","pdfPath":"/iel5/8920/5667084/05661811.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSII.2010.2083130","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5667084","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 0.45-V 300-MHz 10T Flowthrough SRAM With Expanded write/ read Stability and Speed-Area-Wise Array for Sub-0.5-V Chips","abstract":"Capable of only solving the read-stability issue, many 8T-10T static RAM (SRAM) cells require extra write-assist circuits to achieve low supply voltage operation.

The main benefits of this implementation are the acceleration of the processing reached by the parallelism inherent to the hardware design, the high level of integration, the consequent security and reliability improvements provided by the usage of a system-on-programmable-chip device that is able to embed the main components of the application in a single chip, and the low cost achieved by the whole system due to the reconfigurability performance featured by the suggested FPGA. All these factors result in an outstanding system that is able to authenticate the identity of any user by means of those distinctive characteristics available in fingerprints. This brief reveals the advantages of run-time reconfigurable hardware in the implementation of those embedded systems demanding real-time performance at low cost. The minimization of the reconfiguration overhead by means of the proper sizing of the reconfigurable region in the FPGA and the design of a hardware configuration controller that is able to reach the maximum configuration rates allowed by the technology (3.2 Gb/s) are key factors to succeed in the development of the embedded AFAS application. The proposed system, which is implemented by means of hardware-software co-design techniques under a Virtex4 XC4VLX25 FPGA working at 100 MHz, is able to overcome in one order of magnitude the execution time performance achieved by a personal computer platform based on an Intel Core2Duo microprocessor running at 1.83 GHz.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fingerprint Image Processing Acceleration Through Run-Time Reconfigurable Hardware","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","doi":"10.1109/TCSII.2010.2087970","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","pdfPath":"/iel5/8920/5667084/05661812.pdf","startPage":"991","endPage":"995","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSII.2010.2087970","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5667084","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5661812","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5661812/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 December 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2010","displayDocTitle":"Fingerprint Image Processing Acceleration Through Run-Time Reconfigurable Hardware","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"57","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/5661812/","dateOfInsertion":"13 December 2010","publicationDate":"Dec. 2010","accessionNumber":"11693133","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fingerprint Image Processing Acceleration Through Run-Time Reconfigurable Hardware","sourcePdf":"tcsii-fons-2087970-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.054977S","chronDate":"Dec.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"8920","isNumber":"5667084","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8920","citationCount":"36","xplore-issue":"5667084","articleId":"5661812","onlineDate":"10 December 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5661822,"authors":[{"name":"W.

This paper proposes new robust counterparts for the S-LMS family based on M-estimation. The proposed sequential least mean M-estimate (S-LMM) family of algorithms employ nonlinearity to improve their robustness to impulsive noise. Another contribution of this paper is the presentation of a convergence performance analysis for the S-LMS/S-LMM family for Gaussian inputs and additive Gaussian or contaminated Gaussian noises. The analysis is important for engineers to understand the behaviors of these algorithms and to select appropriate parameters for practical realizations. The theoretical analyses reveal the advantages of input normalization and the M-estimation in combating impulsive noise.

A new prognostic method is developed in this paper using adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference systems (ANFISs) and high-order particle filtering. The ANFIS is trained via machine historical failure data. The trained ANFIS and its modeling noise constitute an \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">m</i>\nth-order hidden Markov model to describe the fault propagation process. The high-order particle filter uses this Markov model to predict the time evolution of the fault indicator in the form of a probability density function. An online update scheme is developed to adapt the Markov model to various machine dynamics quickly. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated by using the testing data from a cracked carrier plate and a faulty bearing. Results show that it outperforms classical condition predictors.","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2010.2098369","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/5979518/05661830.pdf","startPage":"4353","endPage":"4364","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5979518","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2010.2098369","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Machine Condition Prediction Based on Adaptive Neuro\u2013Fuzzy and High-Order Particle Filtering","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5661830","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2011","displayDocTitle":"Machine Condition Prediction Based on Adaptive Neuro\u2013Fuzzy and High-Order Particle Filtering","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5661830/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"12 August 2011","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"12172203","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5661830/","volume":"58","issue":"9","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 December 2010","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Machine Condition Prediction Based on Adaptive Neuro\u2013Fuzzy and High-Order Particle Filtering","sourcePdf":"tie-chen-2098369-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.087021S","chronDate":"Sept.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"5979518","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"169","xplore-issue":"5979518","articleId":"5661830","onlineDate":"10 December 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5661831,"authors":[{"name":"S\u00e9rgio M.

The proposed method uses the absolute values of nine modulated error voltages for the continuous monitoring of the condition of the bidirectional switches of an MC. This method allows a fast detection and location of the faulty switches, independent of the modulation strategy of the converter, its voltage transfer ratio, output frequency, or type of load connected to it, both in steady-state and transient regimes.

The operating principles of the proposed converter and the Magamp postregulator are analyzed in detail. Furthermore, the design criterion for the Magamp core is presented, and the dead-time problem of the Magamp postregulator is analyzed. Compared with a flyback converter, the dead-time impact in the LLC structure is much better for two main reasons. The first one is that there is no reverse-recovery resetting effect for the Magamp postregulator in an LLC topology, and the second is that, when the same dead time is applied in both converters, the effect is better by using an LLC topology than a flyback topology. Finally, an experimental prototype of 310-V input and 24-V/3-A and 18-V/2-A outputs was built and tested to verify the zero-voltage-switching (zero-current-switching) operation and the high cross-regulating ratio. The experimental results prove that the dead-time impact over a Magamp in an LLC converter is much better than that when using a flyback converter, since a high cross-regulating ratio was easily achieved without using complicate resetting methods or large dead load.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5661833/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 December 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5661833/","dateOfInsertion":"12 August 2011","publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12172204","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"58","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"High Cross-Regulation Multioutput <formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex Notation=\"TeX\">$LLC$</tex></formula> Series Resonant Converter With Magamp Postregulator","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High Cross-Regulation Multioutput <formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex Notation=\"TeX\">$LLC$</tex></formula> Series Resonant Converter With Magamp Postregulator","sourcePdf":"tie-hang-2098374-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.095825S","chronDate":"Sept.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"5979518","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"5979518","articleId":"5661833","onlineDate":"10 December 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5661838,"authors":[{"name":"Hongryel Kim","affiliation":["Candidate of the Department of EE, Pusan National University, Busan, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/5979518/5661838/5661838-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Hongryel Kim received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electronic engineering from Dong-Eui University, Busan, Korea, in 1998 and 2000, respectively.

In order to apply a sensorless PMSM control which is robust against parameter fluctuations and disturbances, a high-speed SMO is proposed, which estimates the rotor position and the angular velocity from the back EMF. In the conventional SMO, a low-pass filter and an additional position compensation of the rotor are used to reduce the chattering problem that is commonly found in the SMO using the signum function. In order to overcome the time delay caused by the low-pass filter, in this research, a sigmoid function is used for the switching function instead of the signum function. Also, the variation in the stator resistance is estimated to improve the steady-state performance of the SMO. The stability of the proposed SMO was verified using the Lyapunov second method to determine the observer gain. The validity of the proposed high-speed PMSM sensorless velocity control has been demonstrated with simulations and real experiments.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/5979518/05661838.pdf","startPage":"4069","endPage":"4077","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2010.2098357","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2010.2098357","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5979518","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5661838","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A High-Speed Sliding-Mode Observer for the Sensorless Speed Control of a PMSM","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Observers","Estimation","Lyapunov methods","Permanent magnet motors","Sensorless control","AC motors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["angular velocity control","low-pass filters","Lyapunov methods","permanent magnet motors","rotors","sensorless machine control","synchronous motors","variable structure systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["permanent-magnet synchronous motor","PMSM","high-speed sliding-mode observer","sensorless speed control","sigmoid function","signum function","variable boundary layer","rotor position","angular velocity","low-pass filter","chattering problem","switching function","Lyapunov second method","velocity control"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Estimation","Lyapunov function","permanent-magnet synchronous motor (PMSM)","sensorless control","sigmoid function","sliding-mode observer (SMO)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5661838/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 December 2010","displayDocTitle":"A High-Speed Sliding-Mode Observer for the Sensorless Speed Control of a PMSM","volume":"58","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/5661838/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12205729","dateOfInsertion":"12 August 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A High-Speed Sliding-Mode Observer for the Sensorless Speed Control of a PMSM","sourcePdf":"tie-lee-2098357-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.070022S","chronDate":"Sept.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"5979518","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"377","xplore-issue":"5979518","articleId":"5661838","onlineDate":"10 December 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-19"},{"_id":5661842,"authors":[{"name":"Sudip K.

The structure includes the use of the Clarke transformation and moving average filters (MAFs). The positive-sequence phase angle can be obtained from the alpha-beta components; however, such a detection becomes inaccurate if the grid voltages are unbalanced and/or distorted. The MAF is used to filter the nonideal components. Performance of the MAF is analyzed mathematically for a proper selection of the window width of the optimal filter in this application. The time delay introduced by MAFs is constant and known; hence, this may be compensated. The proposed detector structure allows fast detection of the grid voltage positive sequence (within one grid voltage cycle). The MAF completely eliminates any oscillation multiple of the frequency for which it is designed; thus, this algorithm can overcome the presence of imbalances or harmonics in the electrical grid. Furthermore, it includes a simple frequency estimator that makes the SFSD frequency adaptive and is capable of operating under large frequency changes. The entire SFSD is verified through simulation and experiment, showing very good performance even under several extreme grid voltage conditions.","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2010.2098352","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/5979518/05661845.pdf","startPage":"4275","endPage":"4287","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2010.2098352","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5979518","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Frequency-Adaptive Stationary-Reference-Frame Grid Voltage Sequence Detector for Distributed Generation Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5661845","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 December 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5661845/","displayDocTitle":"Frequency-Adaptive Stationary-Reference-Frame Grid Voltage Sequence Detector for Distributed Generation Systems","volume":"58","issue":"9","publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12205735","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5661845/","dateOfInsertion":"12 August 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Frequency-Adaptive Stationary-Reference-Frame Grid Voltage Sequence Detector for Distributed Generation Systems","sourcePdf":"tie-robles-2098352-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.247703S","chronDate":"Sept.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"5979518","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"49","xplore-issue":"5979518","articleId":"5661845","onlineDate":"10 December 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5661853,"authors":[{"name":"Dimitris Theodoropoulos","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, Delft University of Technnology, Delft, Netherlands"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6046/5732768/5661853/5661853-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Dimitris Theodoropoulos (S'06) was born in Athens, Greece.

However, most of them are based on standard PCs, which introduce performance limitations and excessive power consumption. To address these drawbacks, we explore the implementation prospectives of two Immersive-Audio technologies: the beamforming (BF) and the wave field synthesis (WFS). We target two popular multi-core platforms, namely graphic processor units (GPUs) and field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs). We identify the most computationally intensive parts of both applications and employ the CUDA environment to map them onto a Quadro FX1700, a GeForce 8600GT, a GTX275, and a GTX460 GPU. Furthermore, we design our custom multi-core hardware accelerators for both algorithms and map them onto Virtex6 FPGAs. Both GPU and FPGA implementations are compared against OpenMP-annotated software running on a Core2 Duo at 3.0 GHz. Experimental results suggest that middle-range GPUs process data equally well as the Core2 Duo for the BF, and approximately two times faster for the WFS. However, high-end GPU and FPGA solutions provide an order of magnitude better performance for BF, and approximately two orders of magnitude better performance for WFS than the Core2 Duo. Ultimately, single-chip GPU and FPGA implementations can provide more power-effective solutions, since they can drive more complex microphone and loudspeaker setups than PC-based approaches.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5661853/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 December 2010","volume":"13","issue":"2","accessionNumber":"11874671","publicationDate":"April 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5661853/","dateOfInsertion":"17 March 2011","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Multi-Core Platforms for Beamforming and Wave Field Synthesis","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-Core Platforms for Beamforming and Wave Field Synthesis","sourcePdf":"tmm-theodoropoulos-2098397-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.110128S","chronDate":"April  2011","xplore-pub-id":"6046","isNumber":"5732768","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6046","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"5732768","articleId":"5661853","onlineDate":"10 December 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5661863,"authors":[{"name":"Wang Yao","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Computer Science, University of Southampton, Southampton, UK"],"firstName":"Wang","lastName":"Yao","id":"37404230900"},{"name":"Sheng Chen","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Computer Science, University of Southampton, Southampton, UK"],"firstName":"Sheng","lastName":"Chen","id":"37277597300"},{"name":"Lajos Hanzo","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Computer Science, University of Southampton, Southampton, UK"],"firstName":"Lajos","lastName":"Hanzo","id":"37276255400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9545"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1939-9359"}],"articleNumber":"5661863","dbTime":"17 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":22,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":493},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Vehicular Technology Society","url":"http://www.vtsociety.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bit error rate","Transmitting antennas","Algorithm design and analysis","Channel estimation","Optimization","Receivers","Vectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error statistics","least mean squares methods","mobile radio","multifrequency antennas","particle swarm optimisation","precoding","receiving antennas","transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["generalized MBER-based vector precoding design","multiuser transmission","minimum bit error rate criterion","base station","multiple transmitting antennas","single-receiving-antenna mobile station receivers","modulo device","channel state information","current information symbol vector","particle swarm optimization algorithm","minimum mean-square-error","rank-deficient systems","MMSE"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Minimum bit error rate (MBER)","minimum mean square error (MMSE)","multiuser transmission (MUT)","particle swarm optimization (PSO)","vector precoding (VP)"]}],"abstract":"We propose a generalized vector precoding (VP) design based on the minimum bit error rate (MBER) criterion for multiuser transmission in the downlink of a multiuser system, where the base station (BS) equipped with multiple transmitting antennas communicates with single-receiving-antenna mobile station (MS) receivers each having a modulo device.

Limited computation, battery lifetime and communication bandwidth make efficient use of these platforms crucial. In this paper, we introduce a novel classification model that identifies physical movements from body-worn inertial sensors while taking collaborative nature and limited resources of the system into consideration. Our action recognition model uses a decision tree structure to minimize the number of nodes involved in classification of each action. The decision tree is constructed based on the quality of action recognition in individual nodes. A clustering technique is employed to group similar actions and measure quality of per-node identifications. We pose an optimization problem for finding a minimal set of sensor nodes contributing to the action recognition. We then prove that this problem is NP-hard and provide fast greedy algorithms to approximate the solution. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our distributed algorithm on data collected from five healthy subjects. In particular, our system achieves a 72.4% reduction in the number of active nodes while maintaining 93.3% classification accuracy.","doi":"10.1109/TII.2010.2089990","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TII.2010.2089990","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics","pdfPath":"/iel5/9424/5709247/05661882.pdf","startPage":"66","endPage":"77","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5709247","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Physical Movement Monitoring Using Body Sensor Networks: A Phonological Approach to Construct Spatial Decision Trees","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5661882/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 December 2010","displayDocTitle":"Physical Movement Monitoring Using Body Sensor Networks: A Phonological Approach to Construct Spatial Decision Trees","volume":"7","issue":"1","dateOfInsertion":"04 February 2011","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2011","accessionNumber":"11793749","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5661882/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Physical Movement Monitoring Using Body Sensor Networks: A Phonological Approach to Construct Spatial Decision Trees","sourcePdf":"tii-ghasemzadeh-2089990-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.082094S","chronDate":"Feb.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"9424","isNumber":"5709247","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9424","citationCount":"65","xplore-issue":"5709247","articleId":"5661882","onlineDate":"10 December 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5661883,"authors":[{"name":"Yunhe Hou","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/59/5958775/5661883/5661883-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yunhe Hou (M'06) received the B.E. and Ph.D. degrees from Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China, in 1999 and 2005, respectively.","He worked as a postdoctoral research fellow at Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, from 2005 to 2007.

Several smart charging algorithms are used to set the point about which the rate of charge varies while performing regulation.

Because of the specific characteristics of the microgrid, such as the resistive lines and the high degree of power-electronically interfaced generators, new power control methods for the generators have been introduced. For the active power control in this paper, a variant of the conventional droop P/f control strategy is used, namely the voltage-droop controller. However, because of the small size of the microgrid and the high share of renewables with an intermittent character, new means of flexibility in power balancing are required to ensure stable operation. Therefore, a novel active load control strategy is presented in this paper. The aim is to render a proof of concept for this control strategy in an islanded microgrid. The active load control is triggered by the microgrid voltage level. The latter is enabled by using the voltage-droop control strategy and its specific properties. It is concluded that the combination of the voltage-droop control strategy with the presented demand dispatch allows reliable power supply without interunit communication for the primary control, leads to a more efficient usage of the renewable energy and can even lead to an increased share of renewables in the islanded microgrid.","doi":"10.1109/TSG.2010.2090911","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid","pdfPath":"/iel5/5165411/5715606/05661889.pdf","startPage":"139","endPage":"151","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSG.2010.2090911","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5715606","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Active Load Control in Islanded Microgrids Based on the Grid Voltage","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5661889","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 December 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5661889/","displayDocTitle":"Active Load Control in Islanded Microgrids Based on the Grid Voltage","volume":"2","issue":"1","publicationDate":"March 2011","accessionNumber":"11832548","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"17 February 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Active Load Control in Islanded Microgrids Based on the Grid Voltage","sourcePdf":"tsg-vandoorn-2090911-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.061431S","chronDate":"March  2011","isNumber":"5715606","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5165411","citationCount":"139","articleId":"5661889","onlineDate":"10 December 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5661890,"authors":[{"name":"Mahdi Shabany","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/92/6099858/5661890/5661890-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Mahdi Shabany (S'04\u2013A'08) received the B.

Recently some theoretical approaches to determine the PAPR distribution have been proposed based on the assumption that all subcarriers are allocated with equal power, and that number of subcarriers is large. As a result Gaussian approximations may be used. However, these assumptions may not be valid due to the following facts: (i) in all realistic OFDM systems, usually only a subset of subcarriers is used to carry information and the rest are set to zero, (ii) power allocation may not be uniform and may depend on bit and power loading. As a result the Gaussian approximation is not longer valid to compute the PAPR distribution. In this paper we derive an analytical expression of the PAPR distribution of low order OFDM signal having non-equal amplitudes. To validate the analytical results, extensive numerical analysis have been conducted, showing a very good match between the analytically results and that of real OFDM systems.","doi":"10.1109/EEEI.2010.5661895","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE 26-th Convention of Electrical and Electronics Engineers in Israel","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE 26-th Convention of Electrical and Electronics Engineers in Israel","pdfPath":"/iel5/5655386/5661892/05661895.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EEEI.2010.5661895","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5661892","startPage":"000165","endPage":"000169","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distribution of PAPR in low order OFDM with non equal amplitudes","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5661895","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Distribution of PAPR in low order OFDM with non equal amplitudes","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 Nov. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5661895/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"17-20 Nov. 2010","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2010","accessionNumber":"11695792","dateOfInsertion":"13 December 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5661895/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distribution of PAPR in low order OFDM with non equal amplitudes","confLoc":"Eilat, Israel","sourcePdf":"ieeei2010submission62.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05818S","chronDate":"17-20 Nov. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5655386","isNumber":"5661892","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5655386","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5661892","articleId":"5661895","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5661931,"authors":[{"name":"Michal Palgy","affiliation":["Department of EE-Systems, Tel-Aviv University, Israel"],"firstName":"Michal","lastName":"Palgy","id":"37601561800"},{"name":"Jan \u00d8stergaard","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Systems, University of Aalborg, Denmark"],"firstName":"Jan","lastName":"\u00d8stergaard","id":"37284711200"},{"name":"Ram Zamir","affiliation":["Department of EE-Systems, Tel-Aviv University, Israel"],"firstName":"Ram","lastName":"Zamir","id":"37284119000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8682-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8681-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-8680-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5661931","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":117},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiple description image/video compression using oversampling and noise shaping in the DCT-domain","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5661931","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Noise shaping","Encoding","Transform coding","Quantization","Streaming media","Discrete cosine transforms","PSNR"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discrete cosine transforms","diversity reception","Internet","quantisation (signal)","source coding","video coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiple description source coding","image compression","video compression","oversampling","noise shaping","discrete cosine transform domain","diversity system","Internet","wireless network","compression standards","dithered delta-sigma quantization","JPEG/MPEG core"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Multiple-Description coding","dithered Delta-Sigma quantization","JPEG","MPEG","DCT"]}],"abstract":"Multiple Descriptions (MDs) source coding is a method to overcome unexpected information loss in a diversity system such as the internet, or a wireless network. In case that the information can suffer loss and still be intelligible, like audio or video, MD is a way to take full advantage of the diversity in the system and provide graceful degradation. Standards-compliant MD coding targeting widely used compression standards, such as JPEG and MPEG, have so far however received little attention in the literature. A recently proposed scheme of MD coding by dithered Delta-Sigma Quantization (DSQ) utilizes oversampling in order to accomplish diversity, and noise shaping to control the distortion-versus-loss trade off at any fixed rate. In this work we implement a DSQ-based MD compression scheme for images/videos working in the discrete cosine transform (DCT) domain. The MD encoder and decoder consist of a standard JPEG/MPEG core, with additional processing and control.

An iterative algorithm with linear complexity was proposed by Burshtein for the binary case. However, this algorithm cannot be trivially generalized for the non-binary case, since the derivation uses the even parity property of the check nodes, which does not hold for codes over GF(q). In this work the algorithm is generalized to the non-binary case. We show, that by applying this algorithm to a softened version of the non-binary LP problem proposed by Flanagan, Skachek, Byrne and Grefeath, we can obtain, with complexity linear in the block length, a feasible solution vector for the non-binary LP decoding problem, which is arbitrarily close to optimal in the following sense. The distance between the minimum value achieved by the exact LP decoder and the objective function value of the approximate solution, normalized by the block length of the code, can be made arbitrarily small. We present simulation results and comparisons with the belief propagation (BP) algorithm using-regular ternary LDPC codes. The proposed algorithm can be easily extended to generalized LDPC codes.","doi":"10.1109/EEEI.2010.5661933","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE 26-th Convention of Electrical and Electronics Engineers in Israel","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE 26-th Convention of Electrical and Electronics Engineers in Israel","pdfPath":"/iel5/5655386/5661892/05661933.pdf","startPage":"000960","endPage":"000964","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EEEI.2010.5661933","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5661892","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5661933","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Approximate iterative LP decoding of LDPC codes over GF(q) in linear complexity","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 Nov. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5661933/","displayDocTitle":"Approximate iterative LP decoding of LDPC codes over GF(q) in linear complexity","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5661933/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"13 December 2010","conferenceDate":"17-20 Nov. 2010","accessionNumber":"11695829","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Approximate iterative LP decoding of LDPC codes over GF(q) in linear complexity","confLoc":"Eilat, Israel","sourcePdf":"ieeei2010submission319.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055579S","chronDate":"17-20 Nov. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5655386","isNumber":"5661892","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5655386","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5661892","articleId":"5661933","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5661937,"authors":[{"name":"Adam Mashiach","affiliation":["Tel-Aviv University, Israel"],"firstName":"Adam","lastName":"Mashiach","id":"37601577500"},{"name":"Jan \u00d8stergaard","affiliation":["Aalborg University, Denmark"],"firstName":"Jan","lastName":"\u00d8stergaard","id":"37284711200"},{"name":"Ram Zamir","affiliation":["Tel-Aviv University, Israel"],"firstName":"Ram","lastName":"Zamir","id":"37284119000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8682-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8681-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-8680-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5661937","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":98},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Receivers","Quantization","Noise","Lattices","Resource description framework","Noise shaping","Decoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["combined source-channel coding","delta-sigma modulation","distortion","feedback","Gaussian noise","mean square error methods","optimisation","quantisation (signal)","rate distortion theory","receivers","sampling methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["description delta-sigma quantization","central receiver","L-channel symmetric multiple description coding","dithered delta-sigma quantization","oversampling process","L redundant representation","feedback-loop","trading-off side distortion","central distortion","lattice quantizer dimension","high noise-shaping filter order","Gaussian source","MSE fidelity criterion","rate-distortion function","nonexplicit optimization problem","joint source-channel coding problem"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5661937","abstract":"In this work we present a practical scheme for L-channel symmetric Multiple Description coding when one is only interested in receiving either a single description or all L descriptions.

The increasing inter-chip requirements makes it extremely difficult to overcome the delay, power, and bandwidth limitations of the existing electrical wires technology In this research, unguided optical communication bus (UOCB) design for inter-chip communication is analyzed. A UOCB includes transceiver arrays for each chip that transmit information without a waveguide, such that an array of beams propagates through a solid plate. The solid plate is the computer motherboard and is used to hold the chip physically and, in addition, as a propagation medium for the communication beams. The bus space is reused, or multiplexed, such that more than one beam propagates though it simultaneously. The communication through the bus takes advantage of the scattering effect, reflection and diffusion from the walls. We examined the data transmission requirement for uncorrelated optical communication paths between the multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) optical receiver and transmission arrays over highly diffused propagation bus. Each optical communication path between potential receiver and transmitter locations was described in terms of the optical channel gain, representing the individual optical path. An example of a MIMO gain matrix H between multiple spatial locations was evaluated.","doi":"10.1109/EEEI.2010.5661945","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE 26-th Convention of Electrical and Electronics Engineers in Israel","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE 26-th Convention of Electrical and Electronics Engineers in Israel","pdfPath":"/iel5/5655386/5661892/05661945.pdf","startPage":"000911","endPage":"000914","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EEEI.2010.5661945","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5661892","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Unguided optical communication bus for next-generation computers: Design concept","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5661945","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 Nov. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5661945/","displayDocTitle":"Unguided optical communication bus for next-generation computers: Design concept","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2010","accessionNumber":"11695841","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5661945/","conferenceDate":"17-20 Nov. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"13 December 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Unguided optical communication bus for next-generation computers: Design concept","confLoc":"Eilat, Israel","sourcePdf":"ieeei2010submission301.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.08451S","chronDate":"17-20 Nov. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5655386","isNumber":"5661892","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5655386","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5661892","articleId":"5661945","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5661954,"authors":[{"name":"Roy Maiberger","affiliation":["Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Beersheba, Israel"],"firstName":"Roy","lastName":"Maiberger","id":"37601541500"},{"name":"Doron Ezri","affiliation":["Greenair Wireless, Ramat-Gan, Israel"],"firstName":"Doron","lastName":"Ezri","id":"37601540600"},{"name":"Michael Erlihson","affiliation":["Runcom Technologies Limited, Rishon Lezion, Israel"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Erlihson","id":"37601542900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8682-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8681-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-8680-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5661954","dbTime":"20 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":984},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Array signal processing","Arrays","MIMO","Global Positioning System","Vectors","Transmitters","Signal to noise ratio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","Global Positioning System","MIMO communication","precoding","radio receivers","radio transmitters","WiMax"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["location based beamforming","channel state information","transmitter","multiple input multiple output system","MIMO system","receiver positioning data","GPS positioning data","modern communications systems","IEEE802.16e codebook","precoders"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Transmit beamforming","Precoding codebook","line of sight"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5661954","doi":"10.1109/EEEI.2010.5661954","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE 26-th Convention of Electrical and Electronics Engineers in Israel","abstract":"When channel state information is available at the transmitter, it can be exploited to increase the throughput, or to enhance the performance of a multiple input multiple output (MIMO) system. Beamforming schemes, such as closed loop MIMO and transmit beamforming constitute efficient means to achieve the aforementioned objectives. A significant shortcoming of transmit beamforming schemes is the signaling overhead required to provide the transmitter with the downlink channel knowledge. Another drawback of transmit beamforming schemes is their sensitivity to channel state information accuracy. In this paper we suggest an alternative beamforming method that uses the receiver positioning data, for example GPS positioning data, to create the transmit beamforming vector. This approach is attractive as in many modern communications systems location based services provide the transmitter (for example a cellular base station) with continuous information respective to the physical position of the receiver (the celluar phone in this case). The location based beamforming method constructs precoding vectors that are optimized for line of sight scenarios. Our simulations show that line of sight precoders are superior to regular codebooks based precoders, such as the IEEE802.16e codebook, in line of sight scenarios. Surprisingly the proposed precoders exhibit acceptable (and even superior) performance in some non line of sight scenarios.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EEEI.2010.5661954","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5661892","startPage":"000184","endPage":"000187","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE 26-th Convention of Electrical and Electronics Engineers in Israel","pdfPath":"/iel5/5655386/5661892/05661954.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Location based beamforming","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5661954/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 Nov. 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5661954/","displayDocTitle":"Location based beamforming","conferenceDate":"17-20 Nov. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2010","accessionNumber":"11695851","dateOfInsertion":"13 December 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Location based beamforming","confLoc":"Eilat, Israel","sourcePdf":"ieeei2010submission68.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052157S","chronDate":"17-20 Nov. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5655386","isNumber":"5661892","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5655386","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"5661892","articleId":"5661954","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5661955,"authors":[{"name":"Alon Kuperman","affiliation":["Center of Samaria, Ariel University, Israel"],"firstName":"Alon","lastName":"Kuperman","id":"37283773600"},{"name":"Udi Levy","affiliation":["Gamatronic Electronic Industries Limited, Israel"],"firstName":"Udi","lastName":"Levy","id":"37589754800"},{"name":"Joseph Goren","affiliation":["Gamatronic Electronic Industries Limited, Israel"],"firstName":"Joseph","lastName":"Goren","id":"37355900300"},{"name":"Aryeh Zafranski","affiliation":["Gamatronic Electronic Industries Limited, Israel"],"firstName":"Aryeh","lastName":"Zafranski","id":"37601572800"},{"name":"Alex Savernin","affiliation":["Gamatronic Electronic Industries Limited, Israel"],"firstName":"Alex","lastName":"Savernin","id":"37601571600"},{"name":"Ilan Peled","affiliation":["Better Place, Inc., USA"],"firstName":"Ilan","lastName":"Peled","id":"37588445100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8682-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8681-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-8680-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5661955","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1467},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Batteries","Active filters","Rectifiers","Converters","Electric vehicles","Harmonic analysis","Power harmonic filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["battery management systems","DC-DC power convertors","electric vehicles","power factor","power filters","rectifiers","secondary cells"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electric vehicle fast charger","vehicle battery","Gamatronic Electronic Industries LTD","two-stage controlled rectifier","bridge rectifier","active power filter","uncontrolled DC bus","grid codes","power factor","DC-DC converters","active filters control circuitry","DC-DC control circuitry","battery management system","power 50 kW"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5661955","doi":"10.1109/EEEI.2010.5661955","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE 26-th Convention of Electrical and Electronics Engineers in Israel","abstract":"Modeling and control of a 50KW vehicle battery fast charger prototype, developed at Gamatronic Electronic Industries LTD, is presented in the paper.

The input stage creates an uncontrolled DC bus while complying with the grid codes by keeping the THD and power factor within the permissible limits. The output stage is formed by six interleaved groups of two DC-DC converters, reducing the input and output current ripples. Two independent control boards are employed: active filters control circuitry and the DC-DC control circuitry. The former is operated according to the predetermined grid interfacing behavior, while the operation of the latter is dictated by the requests from the Battery Management System.

This fundamental relationship and its generalizations, referred to as the I-MMSE relationships, have already been shown to be useful in several aspects of Information Theory. An inherent property of the MMSE, is the \u201csingle crossing point\u201d property: as a function of snr, the MMSE of the Gaussian input distribution and the MMSE of an arbitrary input distribution intersect at most once. In this work we will use this property and its recent extensions to the MIMO scenario. In this paper we take a look at two variations of the interference channel: the Gaussian Z-interference channel and the type I Gaussian Broadcast-Z-interference channel. We use the I-MMSE approach to derive outer bounds on the capacity region of these channels. The Z-interference problem is a simplified case of the more general interference channel, for which the capacity region is unknown, in general. The Gaussian Z-interference channel in its standard form is given by: Y\n<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</inf>\n = X\n<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</inf>\n + \u221aaX\n<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</inf>\n + N\n<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</inf>\n Y\n<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</inf>\n = X\n<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</inf>\n + N\n<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</inf>\n where Ni and N2 are standard Gaussian and may be considered independent.

For a \u220a (0, 1), that is, weak interference, there is no known single letter expression for the capacity region. The best known general outer bound is due to Sato. Using Ahlswede's limiting expression for the capacity region, we re-derive Sato's outer bound directly from the limiting expression using the I-MMSE approach and show why this outer bound can not be tight in general. As an additional example of the usage of the I-MMSE approach, we examine the type I Gaussian Broadcast-Z-interference channel, recently presented by Shang and Poor. For this channel we show that the I-MMSE approach can derive equivalent, more natural and insightful, outer bound for the weak interference case.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5661978/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 Nov. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"17-20 Nov. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"13 December 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5661978/","accessionNumber":"11695874","displayDocTitle":"The I-MMSE approach on the weak Gaussian Z-interference channel and the type I Gaussian Broadcast-Z-interference channel","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The I-MMSE approach on the weak Gaussian Z-interference channel and the type I Gaussian Broadcast-Z-interference channel","confLoc":"Eilat, Israel","sourcePdf":"ieeei2010submission97.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056789S","chronDate":"17-20 Nov. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5655386","isNumber":"5661892","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5655386","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5661892","articleId":"5661978","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5662001,"authors":[{"name":"Abdolreza Abdolhosseini Moghadam","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Michigan State University, USA"],"firstName":"Abdolreza Abdolhosseini","lastName":"Moghadam","id":"37317079700"},{"name":"Hayder Radha","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Michigan State University, USA"],"firstName":"Hayder","lastName":"Radha","id":"37269513400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8112-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8110-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8111-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5662001","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":200},"abstract":"We consider the problem of recovering a signal/image (x) with a k-sparse representation, from hybrid (complex and real), noiseless linear samples (y) using a mixture of complex-valued sparse and real-valued dense projections within a single matrix. The proposed Hybrid Compressed Sensing (HCS) employs the complex-sparse part of the projection matrix to divide the n-dimensional signal (x) into subsets. In turn, each subset of the signal (coefficients) is mapped onto a complex sample of the measurement vector (y). Under a worst-case scenario of such sparsity-induced mapping, when the number of complex sparse measurements is sufficiently large then this mapping leads to the isolation of a significant fraction of the k non-zero coefficients into different complex measurement samples from y. Using a simple property of complex numbers (namely complex phases) one can identify the isolated non-zeros of x. After reducing the effect of the identified non-zero coefficients from the compressive samples, we utilize the real-valued dense submatrix to form a full rank system of equations to recover the signal values in the remaining indices (that are not recovered by the sparse complex projection part). We show that the proposed hybrid approach can recover a k-sparse signal (with high probability) while requiring only m \u2248 3k \n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">3</sup>\n\u221a(n/2k) real measurements (where each complex sample is counted as two real measurements). We also derive expressions for the optimal mix of complex-sparse and real-dense rows within an HCS projection matrix. Further, in a practical range of sparsity ratio (k/n) suitable for images, the hybrid approach outperforms even the most complex compressed sensing frameworks (namely basis pursuit with dense Gaussian matrices). The theoretical complexity of HCS is less than the complexity of solving a full-rank system of m linear equations. In practice, the complexity can be lower than this bound.","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Workshop on Multimedia Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5656074/5661979/05662001.pdf","startPage":"99","endPage":"104","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Workshop on Multimedia Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/MMSP.2010.5662001","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MMSP.2010.5662001","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5661979","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5662001","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hybrid Compressed Sensing of images","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Complexity theory","Sparse matrices","Equations","Compressed sensing","Image coding","Decoding","Indexes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image sampling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hybrid compressed sensing","sparse representation","noiseless linear sample","complex sparse measurement","HCS projection matrix","linear equation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Compressed sensing","sparse projections","iterative decoding algorithms"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5662001/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 Oct. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Hybrid Compressed Sensing of images","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5662001/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11694139","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2010","conferenceDate":"4-6 Oct. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hybrid Compressed Sensing of images","confLoc":"Saint-Malo, France","sourcePdf":"p099abdolhosseinimoghadam.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.081045S","chronDate":"4-6 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5656074","isNumber":"5661979","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5656074","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5661979","articleId":"5662001","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5662003,"authors":[{"name":"Maria Trocan","affiliation":["Institut Sup\u00e9rieur d\u00e9Electronique de Paris, France"],"firstName":"Maria","lastName":"Trocan","id":"37563648600"},{"name":"Thomas Maugey","affiliation":["T\u00e9l\u00e9com Paris Technology, France"],"firstName":"Thomas","lastName":"Maugey","id":"37395074500"},{"name":"Eric W.

This gain in performance is obtained by recovering the difference between a set of acquired measurements and the projection of a prediction of the signal they represent. The recovered difference is then added back to the prediction, and the prediction and recovery procedure is repeated in an iterated fashion for each of the views in the multiview image set. The recovered multiview image set is then used as an initialization to repeat the entire process again to form a multistage refinement. Experimental results reveal substantial performance gains from the multistage reconstruction.","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Workshop on Multimedia Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5656074/5661979/05662003.pdf","startPage":"111","endPage":"115","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Workshop on Multimedia Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/MMSP.2010.5662003","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MMSP.2010.5662003","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5661979","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5662003","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multistage compressed-sensing reconstruction of multiview images","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image reconstruction","Image coding","PSNR","Transforms","Compressed sensing","Optimization","Redundancy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image reconstruction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multistage compressed-sensing reconstruction","multiview image recovery","signal prediction","multistage refinement"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5662003/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 Oct. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Multistage compressed-sensing reconstruction of multiview images","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5662003/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11694130","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2010","conferenceDate":"4-6 Oct. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multistage compressed-sensing reconstruction of multiview images","confLoc":"Saint-Malo, France","sourcePdf":"p111trocan.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.125724S","chronDate":"4-6 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5656074","isNumber":"5661979","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5656074","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"5661979","articleId":"5662003","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-03"},{"_id":5662027,"authors":[{"name":"Amadou Diallo","affiliation":["L2S-CNRS-SUPELEC-Univ Paris-Sud, Gif-sur-Yvette, France"],"firstName":"Amadou","lastName":"Diallo","id":"37587801000"},{"name":"Claudio Weidmann","affiliation":["INTHFT, University of Technology, Vienna, Vienna, Austria","LTCI-CNRS-Telecom ParisTech, Paris, France"],"firstName":"Claudio","lastName":"Weidmann","id":"37298796700"},{"name":"Michel Kieffer","affiliation":["L2S-CNRS-SUPELEC-Univ Paris-Sud, Gif-sur-Yvette, France"],"firstName":"Michel","lastName":"Kieffer","id":"37284765000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8112-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8110-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8111-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5662027","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":84},"abstract":"This paper considers the optimization of Error-Correcting Variable-Length Codes (EC-VLC), which are a class of joint-source channel codes.

The obtained results show the advantages of using localized hash information for the high error zones in distributed video coding.","doi":"10.1109/MMSP.2010.5662036","pdfPath":"/iel5/5656074/5661979/05662036.pdf","startPage":"298","endPage":"302","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Workshop on Multimedia Signal Processing","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Workshop on Multimedia Signal Processing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MMSP.2010.5662036","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5661979","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Side information enhancement using an adaptive hash-based genetic algorithm in a Wyner-Ziv context","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5662036/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 Oct. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Side information enhancement using an adaptive hash-based genetic algorithm in a Wyner-Ziv context","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2010","accessionNumber":"11694173","publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5662036/","conferenceDate":"4-6 Oct. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Side information enhancement using an adaptive hash-based genetic algorithm in a Wyner-Ziv context","confLoc":"Saint-Malo, France","sourcePdf":"p298maugey.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056519S","chronDate":"4-6 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5656074","isNumber":"5661979","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5656074","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"5661979","articleId":"5662036","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5662058,"authors":[{"name":"Mariana Poderico","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Ingegneria Elettronica e delle Telecomunicazioni, Naples, Italy"],"firstName":"Mariana","lastName":"Poderico","id":"37586549900"},{"name":"Sara Parrilli","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Ingegneria Elettronica e delle Telecomunicazioni, Naples, Italy"],"firstName":"Sara","lastName":"Parrilli","id":"37294989500"},{"name":"Giovanni Poggi","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Ingegneria Elettronica e delle Telecomunicazioni, Naples, Italy"],"firstName":"Giovanni","lastName":"Poggi","id":"37271954200"},{"name":"Luisa Verdoliva","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Ingegneria Elettronica e delle Telecomunicazioni, Naples, Italy"],"firstName":"Luisa","lastName":"Verdoliva","id":"37283465400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8112-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8110-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8111-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5662058","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":375},"abstract":"In this work we propose a modified version of the BM3D algorithm recently introduced by Dabov et al. for the denoising of images corrupted by additive white Gaussian noise. The original technique performs a multipoint filtering, where the nonlocal approach is combined with the wavelet shrinkage of a 3D cube composed by similar patches collected by means of block-matching. Our improvement concerns the thresholding of wavelet coefficients, which are subject to a different shrinkage depending on their level of sparsity. The modified algorithm is more robust with respect to block matching errors, especially when noise is high, as proved by experimental results on a large set of natural images.","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Workshop on Multimedia Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5656074/5661979/05662058.pdf","startPage":"423","endPage":"426","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Workshop on Multimedia Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/MMSP.2010.5662058","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MMSP.2010.5662058","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5661979","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5662058","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sigmoid shrinkage for BM3D denoising algorithm","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Amplitude modulation","Noise reduction","Three dimensional displays","Wavelet transforms","Image denoising","PSNR"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["AWGN","filtering theory","image denoising","natural scenes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["BM3D denoising algorithm","sigmoid shrinkage","image corruption","additive white Gaussian noise","multipoint filtering","natural images"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5662058/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 Oct. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Sigmoid shrinkage for BM3D denoising algorithm","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5662058/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11694195","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2010","conferenceDate":"4-6 Oct. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sigmoid shrinkage for BM3D denoising algorithm","confLoc":"Saint-Malo, France","sourcePdf":"p423poderico.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057105S","chronDate":"4-6 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5656074","isNumber":"5661979","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5656074","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5661979","articleId":"5662058","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5662082,"authors":[{"name":"Amit Vishnipolsky","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Tel-Aviv University, Israel"],"firstName":"Amit","lastName":"Vishnipolsky","id":"37601650300"},{"name":"Eran Socher","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Tel-Aviv University, Israel"],"firstName":"Eran","lastName":"Socher","id":"37371220200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8682-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8681-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-8680-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5662082","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":614},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["CMOS integrated circuits","Metals","CMOS technology","Power amplifiers","Gain","Couplings","Coils"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS analogue integrated circuits","differential amplifiers","millimetre wave amplifiers","MIMIC","power transformers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compact power efficient transformer","differential W-band CMOS amplifier","mixed signal-radio frequency CMOS process","bond pads","frequency 82.5 GHz to 86.7 GHz","voltage 1.4 V","size 90 nm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Differential Design","mm-Wave","CMOS","Integrated Transformers","W-band","E-band"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5662082","abstract":"This paper presents a compact power efficient, fully differential transformer coupled CMOS amplifier with 4.2GHz 3-dB bandwidth ranging from 82.5 to 86.7GHz, with a peak gain of 10.5dB at 84.1GHz drawing 37mW from a supply of Vdd=1.4V and achieving Psat of 8.5dBm.

Multipoint receive beamforming methods are expected to provide additional gains in systems employing advanced coordinated multipoint processing. Due to its importance, receive beamforming has been studied extensively in the literature. The optimal detection schemes are well known in the case of perfect channel knowledge at the receiver. The more realistic case, where the beamformer is constructed using a finite training sequence transmitted by the desired transmitter has also been addressed. The study of the latter case, known as finite sample beamforming, focused on linear detection. In this paper we propose new nonlinear finite sample detection schemes for the case of multiple spatial streams. We show that the proposed schemes significantly outperform the known linear detectors and exhibit near optimal performance. We also show that the complexity of the proposed schemes is very similar to that of standard multi stream MIMO detectors, which makes them ideal for real life systems. We apply the new schemes to uplink space division multiple access and demonstrate the implementation and respective performance gains over standard detectors. Finally, we apply our approach to the case of coordinated multipoint reception where multiple base stations jointly decode multiple spatial streams. We study the tradeoff between performance and backhaul capacity and suggest near optimal finite sample schemes.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication,

We perform an analytical evaluation and comparison of different configurable interconnect architectures (mesh NoC, tree, shared bus and point-to-point) emulating variants of two neural network topologies (having full and random exponential configurable connectivity). We derive analytical expressions and asymptotic limits for performance (in terms of bandwidth) and cost (in terms of area and power) of the interconnect architectures considering three communication methods (unicast, multicast and broadcast). It is shown that planar structure, fault and drop tolerance and pulse-information encoding in spiking neural networks makes simple multicast mesh network-on-chip suitable for massively parallel communication required by these networks. Simulation results successfully validate the analytical models and the asymptotic behavior of the network as a function of its size.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 Nov. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5662130/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11695963","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5662130/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"13 December 2010","conferenceDate":"17-20 Nov. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Comparing NoC architectures for neural networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparing NoC architectures for neural networks","confLoc":"Eilat, Israel","sourcePdf":"ieeei2010submission211.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064266S","chronDate":"17-20 Nov. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5655386","isNumber":"5661892","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5655386","xplore-issue":"5661892","articleId":"5662130","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5662133,"authors":[{"name":"S.

These vehicles operate in the unknown environments and make their own decisions within the mission based on the readings of the sensors, without any link with a human operator. Independent of the mission, it is critical for the AUVs to be able to avoid submerged obstacles such as cliffs, wrecks, and floating mines. The AUV typically uses underwater imaging sonar that has several drawbacks for obstacle detection purposes, and therefore requires complex image processing algorithms. Due to the imaging sonar limitations, addressing obstacle detection using conventional software algorithms cannot meet an AUV's real-time, low power requirements. A low-power FPGA algorithm for underwater obstacle detection that is based on local image histogram entropy is proposed. The algorithm maintains a real-time reliable performance while meeting the AUV low power budget.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5662133/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 Nov. 2010","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"17-20 Nov. 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5662133/","dateOfInsertion":"13 December 2010","publicationDate":"Nov. 2010","accessionNumber":"11695966","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Acoustic real-time, low-power FPGA based obstacle detection for AUVs","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Acoustic real-time, low-power FPGA based obstacle detection for AUVs","confLoc":"Eilat, Israel","sourcePdf":"ieeei2010submission210.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.081241S","chronDate":"17-20 Nov. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5655386","isNumber":"5661892","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5655386","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5661892","articleId":"5662133","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5662147,"authors":[{"name":"Adam Teman","affiliation":["Low Power Circuits & Systems Laboratory (LPC&S) VLSI Systems Center, Department of EE, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Beersheba, Israel"],"firstName":"Adam","lastName":"Teman","id":"37569751900"},{"name":"Alexander Fish","affiliation":["Low Power Circuits & Systems Laboratory (LPC&S) VLSI Systems Center, Department of EE, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Beersheba, Israel"],"firstName":"Alexander","lastName":"Fish","id":"37268457100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8682-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8681-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-8680-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5662147","dbTime":"16 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":928},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Random access memory","Transistors","Threshold voltage","Low voltage","Noise","MOS devices","CMOS integrated circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["SRAM chips"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["near-threshold SRAM design","subthreshold SRAM design","standard SRAM cells","supply voltages","bitcells"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["SRAM","Sub-threshold Circuit Design","Near-threshold Circuit Design","Ultra Low Power Digital Systems"]}],"abstract":"Voltage scaling is one of the most effective techniques for power reduction in digital VLSI design, however various challenges arise when operating standard SRAM circuits at low voltages.

Many aspects in the electrical and electronics field (by example: image processing, filter matching, optimization of network parameters, resources allocation) can be solved by finding a target function and his minimum or maximum. For such problems, usually an analytical solution is not available and iterative algorithms are used. An Algorithm based of \u201cBrute Force\u201d require a very large number of iterations, such be a big disadvantage, especially when the algorithm is used for NP (Nondeterministic Polynomial time) problems where complexity and time to solve are incising exponentially with a number of an input parameters. More efficient algorithm is a Genetic Algorithm (GA), which imitates the biological evolution process, finding the solution by mechanism of \u201cnatural selection\u201d, where the strong has higher chances to survive. Appling such algorithm in real time systems requires special approach due to variable number of iterations preformed until a solution is found. In this paper, we present the implementation for a hardware-based accelerator for a GA that solves a specific NP task. The accelerator implemented on a FPGA to provide a high-speed solution for this particular problem, for using in a real time system.

To efficiently utilize the abundant processing resources on future many-core Network-on-Chip (NoC) platforms, the design focus should shift from single-application to multi-application scenarios. In this paper, we propose a multiple application mapping algorithm which maps multiple applications simultaneously onto different regions on the NoC. By optimizing the placement of both applications and tasks, the algorithm aims at shortening the average communication distance which in turn achieves lower network latency and energy consumption for a set of applications. The experimental results show that, compared to the random mapping, the proposed algorithm achieves 59% and 58% reductions of average network delay and energy consumption respectively.","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE 26-th Convention of Electrical and Electronics Engineers in Israel","pdfPath":"/iel5/5655386/5661892/05662160.pdf","startPage":"000540","endPage":"000544","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE 26-th Convention of Electrical and Electronics Engineers in Israel","doi":"10.1109/EEEI.2010.5662160","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EEEI.2010.5662160","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5661892","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5662160","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-application mapping algorithm for Network-on-Chip platforms","keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy consumption","network-on-chip","optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multi-application mapping algorithm","network-on-chip platforms","network latency","energy consumption","optimisation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5662160/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 Nov. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Multi-application mapping algorithm for Network-on-Chip platforms","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5662160/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2010","accessionNumber":"11695993","dateOfInsertion":"13 December 2010","conferenceDate":"17-20 Nov. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-application mapping algorithm for Network-on-Chip platforms","confLoc":"Eilat, Israel","sourcePdf":"ieeei2010submission177.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.095777S","chronDate":"17-20 Nov. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5655386","isNumber":"5661892","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5655386","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5661892","articleId":"5662160","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5662184,"authors":[{"name":"Michael Evzelman","affiliation":["Power Electronics Laboratory, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Beersheba, Israel"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Evzelman","id":"38270238800"},{"name":"Sam Ben-Yaakov","affiliation":["Power Electronics Laboratory, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Beersheba, Israel"],"firstName":"Sam","lastName":"Ben-Yaakov","id":"38270062700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8682-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8681-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-8680-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5662184","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":14,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":354},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Switches","Resistance","Converters","Power capacitors","Switching frequency","Discharges"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["capacitors","charge pump circuits","convertors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimal switch resistances","switched capacitor converters","switching frequency","equivalent resistance","SCC voltage transfer ratio"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5662184","abstract":"Switched Capacitor Converters (SCC) losses are analyzed and the rules for the selection of SCC parameters (such as switch resistances, capacitors values and switching frequency) to meet specific efficiency requirements, are developed.

Specifically, two well-known variants, namely the minimum power distortionless response (MPDR) and minimum variance distortionless response (MVDR) beamformers, are considered. In our scenario, which is typical to many modern communications systems, waves emitted by multiple point sources are received by an antenna array. An analytical expression for the signal to interference and noise ratio (SINR) improvement obtained by both beamformers under steering errors is derived. These expression are experimentally evaluated and compared with the robust Capon beamformer (RCB), a robust variant of the MPDR beamformer. We show that the MVDR beamformer, which uses the noise correlation matrix in its minimization criterion, is more robust to steering errors than its counterparts, that use the received signal correlation matrix. Furthermore, even if the noise correlation matrix is erroneously estimated due to steering errors in the interference direction, the MVDR advantage is still maintained for reasonable range of steering errors. These conclusions conform with Cox findings. Only line of sight propagation regime is considered in the current contribution. Ongoing research extends this work to fading channels.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EEEI.2010.5662190","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5661892","startPage":"000416","endPage":"000420","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE 26-th Convention of Electrical and Electronics Engineers in Israel","pdfPath":"/iel5/5655386/5661892/05662190.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sensitivity analysis of MVDR and MPDR beamformers","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5662190/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 Nov. 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5662190/","displayDocTitle":"Sensitivity analysis of MVDR and MPDR beamformers","conferenceDate":"17-20 Nov. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2010","accessionNumber":"11695876","dateOfInsertion":"13 December 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sensitivity analysis of MVDR and MPDR beamformers","confLoc":"Eilat, Israel","sourcePdf":"ieeei2010submission135.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051422S","chronDate":"17-20 Nov. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5655386","isNumber":"5661892","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5655386","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"5661892","articleId":"5662190","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5662193,"authors":[{"name":"Daniel Seidner","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Israel"],"firstName":"Daniel","lastName":"Seidner","id":"37284852700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8682-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8681-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-8680-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5662193","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":106},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Clocks","Field programmable gate arrays","Registers","Pipelines","Delay","Image processing","IP networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital signal processing chips","field programmable gate arrays","image processing","pipeline processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["configurable zero stall pipelined image processor architecture","FPGA","zero stall image-processing pipelined architecture","effective circuit","Moore state machine","handshake"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["image processor","pipelined image processor","configurable image processor","zero stall"]}],"abstract":"Today's FPGAs are capable of performing complex Image Processing schemes.

Different technical issues (lighting problems, vibrations near camera or conveyor belt, etc.) can lead to noisy images and to wrong classifications or faulty measurements by the vision inspection system. The correlation between motion blur noise (added by technical malfunctions) and the correct measurement by the machine vision system is examined in this paper. First part of the study is to define the influence of motion blur to visual inspection of moving parts with linear velocity of up to 25 m/min. The analyzed vision inspections are size measurement, classification, OCR and code readings. A second study is performed to derive and to propose additional image filtration or vision inspection steps to minimize the wrong measurements according to the inspection type. Of great importance is the added additional amount of processing time. This requires accurate benchmarking of the proposed algorithms within similar laboratory conditions.","doi":"10.1109/EEEI.2010.5662212","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE 26-th Convention of Electrical and Electronics Engineers in Israel","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE 26-th Convention of Electrical and Electronics Engineers in Israel","pdfPath":"/iel5/5655386/5661892/05662212.pdf","startPage":"000328","endPage":"000332","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EEEI.2010.5662212","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5661892","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Increasing the image recognition accuracy in machine vision systems with added noise due to technological issues","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5662212","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 Nov. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5662212/","displayDocTitle":"Increasing the image recognition accuracy in machine vision systems with added noise due to technological issues","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2010","accessionNumber":"11695900","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5662212/","conferenceDate":"17-20 Nov. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"13 December 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Increasing the image recognition accuracy in machine vision systems with added noise due to technological issues","confLoc":"Eilat, Israel","sourcePdf":"ieeei2010submission108.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038559S","chronDate":"17-20 Nov. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5655386","isNumber":"5661892","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5655386","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5661892","articleId":"5662212","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5662214,"authors":[{"name":"Joel Ratsaby","affiliation":["Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Center of Samaria, Ariel University, Ariel, Israel"],"firstName":"Joel","lastName":"Ratsaby","id":"38526278700"},{"name":"Denis Zavielov","affiliation":["Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Center of Samaria, Ariel University, Ariel, Israel"],"firstName":"Denis","lastName":"Zavielov","id":"37601464700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8682-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8681-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-8680-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5662214","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":295},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An FPGA-based pattern classifier using data compression","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5662214","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Encoding","Data compression","Hardware","Computers","Complexity theory","Feature extraction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["C++ language","data compression","feature extraction","field programmable gate arrays","learning (artificial intelligence)","pattern classification"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FPGA-based pattern classifier","text-classification engine","single FPGA chip","arithmetic coding data compression","nonparametric nearest-neighbor algorithm","compression-based distance","text files","parallel hardware architecture","data sequence","arithmetic coding","hardware solution","software-based implementation","C++","hardware-based classifier","communication board","passively monitoring network traffic","anomalous pattern classification","CCTV camera","homeland security","real-time classification","real-time target classification","feature extraction","machine learning","frequency 50 MHz to 3 GHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Data compression","FPGA","parallel architecture","nearest-neighbor algorithm"]}],"abstract":"We implement a text-classification engine on a single FPGA chip running on a 50 Mhz clock.

Many practical systems differ from the ideal schemes discussed in the literature. One example is the lack of precise channel information at the transmitter. We evaluate analytically the performance of a beamforming technique that uses partial channel knowledge. Specifically, we analyze a suboptimal M \u00d7N scheme employing Maximal Ratio Transmission at the transmitter and MRC at the receiver, assuming only one out of M rows of the channel matrix is known at the transmitter. We show that the diversity order and array gain of such a scheme is M+N -1. The performance of this scheme, which is supported by both Worldwide Inter-operability for Microwave Access (WiMAX) and Long Term Evolution (LTE) systems, is identical to that of an MRC system with M+N -1 antennas. All the results are supported by simulations.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5662223/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 Nov. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"13 December 2010","accessionNumber":"11695910","htmlLink":"/document/5662223/","conferenceDate":"17-20 Nov. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Performance of suboptimal beamforming with full knowledge of part of the channel matrix","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance of suboptimal beamforming with full knowledge of part of the channel matrix","confLoc":"Eilat, Israel","sourcePdf":"ieeei2010submission1.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054817S","chronDate":"17-20 Nov. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5655386","isNumber":"5661892","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5655386","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5661892","articleId":"5662223","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5662252,"authors":[{"name":"Ruibo Yuan","affiliation":["Institute of Fluid Power Control Engineering, Faculty of Mechanical and Electrical Engineering, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming, China"],"firstName":"Ruibo","lastName":"Yuan","id":"37086352137"},{"name":"Chungeng Sun","affiliation":["Institute of Fluid Power Control Engineering, Faculty of Mechanical and Electrical Engineering, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming, China"],"firstName":"Chungeng","lastName":"Sun","id":"37597723000"},{"name":"Shaonan Ba","affiliation":["Institute of Fluid Power Control Engineering, Faculty of Mechanical and Electrical Engineering, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming, China"],"firstName":"Shaonan","lastName":"Ba","id":"37587422400"},{"name":"Zongcheng Zhang","affiliation":["Institute of Fluid Power Control Engineering, Faculty of Mechanical and Electrical Engineering, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming, China"],"firstName":"Zongcheng","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37598595000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8438-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5662252","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":441},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5662252","abstract":"This paper analyzes the characteristics of pneumatic position servo system of a mechanical hand in particularly respect to the nonlinearity of the position servo system of a pneumatic manipulator with 3 degrees of freedom.

In this paper, we focus on removing noise and utilization of all kinds of content-characteristics, experiments show that this approach can enhance the universality and accuracy in extracting the body text of web pages.","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Web Information Systems and Mining","pdfPath":"/iel5/5661667/5662245/05662320.pdf","startPage":"246","endPage":"249","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Web Information Systems and Mining","doi":"10.1109/WISM.2010.82","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WISM.2010.82","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5662245","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5662320","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Web Content Information Extraction Approach Based on Removing Noise and Content-Features","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Web pages","Noise","Data mining","Feature extraction","Accuracy","Navigation","Information processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["information retrieval","Internet"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Web content information extraction","Web pages","financial news pages","link density","extracting main content method","content text length","anchor text length","punctuation mark","noise content removal"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["information extraction","web page content extraction","removing noise content"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5662320/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-24 Oct. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Web Content Information Extraction Approach Based on Removing Noise and Content-Features","isConference":true,"volume":"1","htmlLink":"/document/5662320/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11794428","dateOfInsertion":"13 January 2011","conferenceDate":"23-24 Oct. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Web Content Information Extraction Approach Based on Removing Noise and Content-Features","confLoc":"Sanya, China","sourcePdf":"4224a246.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040778S","chronDate":"23-24 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5661667","isNumber":"5662245","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5661667","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"5662245","articleId":"5662320","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5662321,"authors":[{"name":"Liping Zhang","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Engineering, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Liping","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37599411700"},{"name":"Shoubin Dong","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Engineering, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Shoubin","lastName":"Dong","id":"37306779000"},{"name":"Ming Tao","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Engineering, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Ming","lastName":"Tao","id":"37605224100"},{"name":"Tiezhu Zhao","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Engineering, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Tiezhu","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37537915000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8438-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5662321","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":57},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5662321","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Noise measurement","Entropy","Clustering algorithms","Semantics","Web search","Government","Context"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Internet","pattern clustering","query processing","search engines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Web search results clustering","search engine","semantic problem","label quality-oriented scheme","clustering quality","readable label","noisy label","Sougou Chinese query","clustered snippet"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["web search result clustering","label quality","Chinese queries","LQOS","Lingo algorithm"]}],"abstract":"Web search results clustering is an important strategy of organizing the snippets for modern search engine.

In Hadoop, the open-source implementation of MapReduce, scheduling policies, such as FIFO or delay scheduling in FAIR scheduler is used by the master node to distribute waiting tasks to computing nodes (slaves) in response to the status messages of these nodes it receives. Although delay scheduling policy has claimed to improve the throughput and response times by a factor of 2 compared to FIFO policy, it can still achieve more improvement by considering a holistic view of all the tasks waiting to be processed. Therefore, this paper proposes a new scheduler which makes a scheduling decision by evaluating the entire group of tasks in the job queue. A genetic algorithm is designed as the optimization method for the new scheduler. The preliminary simulation results show that our scheduler can get a shorter make span for jobs than FIFO and delay scheduling policies and achieve a better balanced load across all the nodes in the cloud.","doi":"10.1109/WISM.2010.87","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Web Information Systems and Mining","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Web Information Systems and Mining","pdfPath":"/iel5/5661667/5662251/05662430.pdf","startPage":"181","endPage":"186","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WISM.2010.87","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5662251","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"GA-Based Task Scheduler for the Cloud Computing Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5662430","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-24 Oct. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5662430/","displayDocTitle":"GA-Based Task Scheduler for the Cloud Computing Systems","volume":"2","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11794506","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5662430/","conferenceDate":"23-24 Oct. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"13 January 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"GA-Based Task Scheduler for the Cloud Computing Systems","confLoc":"Sanya, China","sourcePdf":"4224b181.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.089472S","chronDate":"23-24 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5661667","isNumber":"5662251","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5661667","citationCount":"46","xplore-issue":"5662251","articleId":"5662430","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5662438,"authors":[{"name":"Guoqiang Gong","affiliation":["School of Computer and Information, Three Gorges University of China, Hubei, China"],"firstName":"Guoqiang","lastName":"Gong","id":"37591661700"},{"name":"Ping Xia","affiliation":["School of Computer and Information, Three Gorges University of China, Hubei, China"],"firstName":"Ping","lastName":"Xia","id":"37604380400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8148-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4196-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5662438","dbTime":"21 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":188},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Channel estimation","Demodulation","Bit error rate","Iterative decoding","Frequency domain analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","error statistics","intercarrier interference","iterative methods","least mean squares methods","maximum likelihood estimation","OFDM modulation","time-varying channels","turbo codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["turbo equalization algorithm","ICI cancellation","OFDM system","bit error rate","time varying channel state information","iterative estimation","soft decision signal","minimum mean square error estimator","maximum a posteriori probability demodulation algorithm","inter carrier interference"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MAP demodulation","OFDM","time varying channels","Turbo equalization"]}],"abstract":"Turbo equalization has been proved to effectively improve bit error rate (BER) over time varying channels.

Actually, cloud is a service-oriented platform because all kind of virtual resources are treated as service to users. Nowadays, most of data-intensive applications have been developed on cloud system. These applications reaches geographically separated storage or data resource with even cross-continental-networks. Then, the performance degradation of networks will surely affect the cloud application performance and user request. In order to ensure guarantee service of bulk data transfer in cloud computing, the reservation and combined resources utilization become critical issues which include data and network resources. This issue involves reserve and assign combined resources to meet user's QoS requirement. According to this problem, a cloud infrastructure service framework (CISF) is proposed to achieve guarantee service for data-intensive applications in this paper. And a service-oriented resource broker (SRB) based on this framework which is proposed to discovery, select, reserve and assign best combined resources. Finally, under user's QoS constraint dynamic resource selection algorithm has been implemented for optimization of combined resources allocation.","doi":"10.1109/GCC.2010.60","publicationTitle":"2010 Ninth International Conference on Grid and Cloud Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 Ninth International Conference on Grid and Cloud Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5661644/5662480/05662492.pdf","startPage":"264","endPage":"269","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GCC.2010.60","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5662480","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Sevice-Oriented Broker for Bulk Data Transfer in Cloud Computing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5662492","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-5 Nov. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5662492/","displayDocTitle":"A Sevice-Oriented Broker for Bulk Data Transfer in Cloud Computing","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2010","accessionNumber":"11794293","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5662492/","conferenceDate":"1-5 Nov. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"13 January 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Sevice-Oriented Broker for Bulk Data Transfer in Cloud Computing","confLoc":"Nanjing, China","sourcePdf":"4313a264.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068943S","chronDate":"1-5 Nov. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5661644","isNumber":"5662480","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5661644","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"5662480","articleId":"5662492","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5662521,"authors":[{"name":"Jing Tai Piao","affiliation":["School of Information Systems and Technology, University of Wollongong, Wollongong, NSW, Australia"],"firstName":"Jing Tai","lastName":"Piao","id":"37587901700"},{"name":"Jun Yan","affiliation":["School of Information Systems and Technology, University of Wollongong, Wollongong, NSW, Australia"],"firstName":"Jun","lastName":"Yan","id":"37293581000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9334-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4313-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2160-4908"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2160-4916"}],"articleNumber":"5662521","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":113,"citationCountPatent":4,"totalDownloads":2716},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Network-aware Virtual Machine Placement and Migration Approach in Cloud Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 Ninth International Conference on Grid and Cloud Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5661644/5662480/05662521.pdf","startPage":"87","endPage":"92","publicationTitle":"2010 Ninth International Conference on Grid and Cloud Computing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GCC.2010.29","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5662480","doi":"10.1109/GCC.2010.29","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resource management","Cloud computing","Memory","Clouds","Virtual machining","Distributed databases","Silicon"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","virtual machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["network-aware virtual machine","virtual machine placement approach","virtual machine migration approach","cloud computing","data transfer time consumption"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["cloud computing","virtual machine","placement","migration","network"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5662521","abstract":"Cloud computing represents a major step up in computing whereby shared computation resources are provided on demand. In such a scenario, applications and data thereof can be hosted by various networked virtual machines (VMs). As applications, especially data-intensive applications, often need to communicate with data frequently, the network I/O performance would affect the overall application performance significantly. Therefore, placement of virtual machines which host an application and migration of these virtual machines while the unexpected network latency or congestion occurs is critical to achieve and maintain the application performance. To address these issues, this paper proposes a virtual machine placement and migration approach to minimizing the data transfer time consumption. Our simulation studies suggest that the proposed approach is effective in optimizing the data transfer between the virtual machine and data, thus helping optimize the overall application performance.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5662521/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-5 Nov. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"Nov. 2010","accessionNumber":"11794322","htmlLink":"/document/5662521/","dateOfInsertion":"13 January 2011","conferenceDate":"1-5 Nov. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Network-aware Virtual Machine Placement and Migration Approach in Cloud Computing","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Network-aware Virtual Machine Placement and Migration Approach in Cloud Computing","confLoc":"Nanjing, China","sourcePdf":"4313a087.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045132S","chronDate":"1-5 Nov. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5661644","isNumber":"5662480","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5661644","citationCount":"113","xplore-issue":"5662480","articleId":"5662521","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5662582,"authors":[{"name":"Pedram Radmand","affiliation":["Digital Ecosystem and Business intelligence Institute, Curtin University of Technology, Perth, Australia"],"firstName":"Pedram","lastName":"Radmand","id":"37601600100"},{"name":"Marc Domingo","affiliation":["Estudis d'Inform\u00e1tica, Multim\u00e9dia i Telecomunicaci\u00f3, UOC, Barcelona, Spain"],"firstName":"Marc","lastName":"Domingo","id":"37594877500"},{"name":"Jaipal Singh","affiliation":["Digital Ecosystem and Business intelligence Institute, Curtin University of Technology, Perth, Australia"],"firstName":"Jaipal","lastName":"Singh","id":"37397122300"},{"name":"Joan Arnedo","affiliation":["Estudis d'Inform\u00e1tica, Multim\u00e9dia i Telecomunicaci\u00f3, UOC, Barcelona, Spain"],"firstName":"Joan","lastName":"Arnedo","id":"37601606900"},{"name":"Alex Talevski","affiliation":["Estudis d'Inform\u00e1tica, Multim\u00e9dia i Telecomunicaci\u00f3, UOC, Barcelona, Spain"],"firstName":"Alex","lastName":"Talevski","id":"37427485900"},{"name":"Stig Petersen","affiliation":["SINTEF ICT, Trondheim, Norway"],"firstName":"Stig","lastName":"Petersen","id":"37602932900"},{"name":"Simon Carlsen","affiliation":["Statoil ASA, Trondheim, Norway"],"firstName":"Simon","lastName":"Carlsen","id":"37604007500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8538-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4237-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5662582","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":16,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":703},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"ZigBee/ZigBee PRO Security Assessment Based on Compromised Cryptographic Keys","abstract":"Sensor networks have many applications in monitoring and controlling of environmental properties such as sound, acceleration, vibration and temperature.

Chord development is successive musical chord. Since there are in-numerably connections, it is hard for general users to create a music development, which suits for user's favorite taste. A previous study has proposed a method to create a chord development by combining Genetic Algorithm and experience data storage system, however, the method did not reflect user's favorite taste. This study proposes a method to create a chord development that suits the user's favorite taste by using Inter-active Genetic Algorithm. In the proposed method, the user evaluates and scores created chord development in 7-point scale. Chord development optimization is performed based on the scores.

Cloud computing is gaining popularity due to its lower cost, high reliability and huge availability. To utilize the powerful and huge capability of cloud computing, this paper is to import it into data mining and machine learning field. As one of the most influential and open competition in machine learning area, Netflix Prize attached with mass storage had driven thousands of teams across the world to attack the problem, among which the final winner was BellKor's Pragmatic Chaos team, who bested Netflix's own algorithm for predicting ratings by 10%. Their solution is an ensemble of a large number of models, each of which specializes in addressing a different aspect of the data. Among such different models, k-nearest neighbors (KNN) and Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) are reported to be two most important and successful models. As a result, we build two predictors based on such two model respectively with the order to testify their performance based on cloud computing platforms. The results show that KNN can achieve root mean square deviation (rmse) with 0:9468 after the Global Effect (GE) data preprocessing, which is better than the Cinematch's performance with rmse being 0:951. The rmse for RBM algorithm is about 0:9670 on the raw dataset, which can be further improved by KNN model.","doi":"10.1109/GCC.2010.89","publicationTitle":"2010 Ninth International Conference on Grid and Cloud Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 Ninth International Conference on Grid and Cloud Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5661644/5662480/05662712.pdf","startPage":"426","endPage":"431","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5662480","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GCC.2010.89","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Data Mining of Mass Storage Based on Cloud Computing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5662712/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-5 Nov. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Data Mining of Mass Storage Based on Cloud Computing","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5662712/","dateOfInsertion":"13 January 2011","publicationDate":"Nov. 2010","accessionNumber":"11794352","conferenceDate":"1-5 Nov. 2010","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Data Mining of Mass Storage Based on Cloud Computing","confLoc":"Nanjing, China","sourcePdf":"4313a426.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04424S","chronDate":"1-5 Nov. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5661644","isNumber":"5662480","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5661644","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"5662480","articleId":"5662712","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5662724,"authors":[{"name":"Thiago Damasceno Cordeiro","affiliation":["Federal University of Pernambuco (UFPE), Recife, Brazil"],"firstName":"Thiago Damasceno","lastName":"Cordeiro","id":"37605320900"},{"name":"Douglas Brito Damalio","affiliation":["Federal University of Pernambuco (UFPE), Recife, Brazil"],"firstName":"Douglas Brito","lastName":"Damalio","id":"37088607283"},{"name":"Nadilma Cintra Valenca Nunes Pereira","affiliation":["Federal University of Pernambuco (UFPE), Recife, Brazil"],"firstName":"Nadilma Cintra Valenca Nunes","lastName":"Pereira","id":"37591162800"},{"name":"Patricia Takako Endo","affiliation":["Federal University of Pernambuco (UFPE), Recife, Brazil"],"firstName":"Patricia Takako","lastName":"Endo","id":"37601641400"},{"name":"Andr\u00e9 de Almeida Palhares","affiliation":["Federal University of Pernambuco (UFPE), Recife, Brazil"],"firstName":"Andr\u00e9","lastName":"de Almeida Palhares","id":"38257287100"},{"name":"Glauco Estacio Gon\u00e7alves","affiliation":["Federal University of Pernambuco (UFPE), Recife, Brazil"],"firstName":"Glauco Estacio","lastName":"Gon\u00e7alves","id":"37585698600"},{"name":"Djamel Fawzi Hadj Sadok","affiliation":["Federal University of Pernambuco (UFPE), Recife, Brazil"],"firstName":"Djamel Fawzi Hadj","lastName":"Sadok","id":"37304290700"},{"name":"Judith Kelner","affiliation":["Federal University of Pernambuco (UFPE), Recife, Brazil"],"firstName":"Judith","lastName":"Kelner","id":"37393672500"},{"name":"Bob Melander","affiliation":["Ericsson Research Limited, Stockholm, Sweden"],"firstName":"Bob","lastName":"Melander","id":"37601639900"},{"name":"Victor Souza","affiliation":["Ericsson Research Limited, Stockholm, Sweden"],"firstName":"Victor","lastName":"Souza","id":"37587753000"},{"name":"Jan-Erik M\u00e5ngs","affiliation":["Ericsson Research Limited, Stockholm, Sweden"],"firstName":"Jan-Erik","lastName":"M\u00e5ngs","id":"37601646400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9334-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4313-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2160-4908"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2160-4916"}],"articleNumber":"5662724","dbTime":"17 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":28,"citationCountPatent":21,"totalDownloads":1870},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Clouds","Computer architecture","Cloud computing","Virtual machine monitors","Driver circuits","Communities","Protocols"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","public domain software"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["open source cloud computing platforms","user selection","XCP","Eucalyptus","Open Nebula"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["cloud computing","open source platforms","XCP","Eucalytpus","OpenNebula"]}],"abstract":"With the popularization of cloud computing, several enterprises and open-source communities have developed their own cloud solutions.

The final transfer function expression is utilized for the analysis and evaluation of the multifunctional potential of SOA-MZI switches, concluding with the necessary conditions for supporting a number of completely different SOA-MZI-based nonlinear signal processing applications that have been demonstrated experimentally: wavelength conversion, packet envelope detection (PED), and clock recovery (CR). The theoretically obtained operational conditions are in close agreement with experimental observations, showing that SOA-MZIs can serve as functional circuit elements in applications with different requirements depending on its operational parameters: as low-pass filtering devices with cut-off frequencies in the megahertz regime or in the multi-gigahertz regime, and as resonant modules resembling band-pass filtering structures. The validity of our theoretical SOA-MZI frequency-domain system model is further confirmed by its successful incorporation in a Fabry-Perot assisted SOA-MZI subsystem, demonstrating PED and CR operations through the exploitation of typical systems theory tools.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/3/5638507/05662829.pdf","startPage":"40","endPage":"49","doi":"10.1109/JQE.2010.2071411","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JQE.2010.2071411","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5638507","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"SOA-MZI-Based Nonlinear Optical Signal Processing: A Frequency Domain Transfer Function for Wavelength Conversion, Clock Recovery, and Packet Envelope Detection","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5662829/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 December 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2011","displayDocTitle":"SOA-MZI-Based Nonlinear Optical Signal Processing: A Frequency Domain Transfer Function for Wavelength Conversion, Clock Recovery, and Packet Envelope Detection","htmlLink":"/document/5662829/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2010","accessionNumber":"11692864","isJournal":true,"volume":"47","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SOA-MZI-Based Nonlinear Optical Signal Processing: A Frequency Domain Transfer Function for Wavelength Conversion, Clock Recovery, and Packet Envelope Detection","sourcePdf":"jqe-pleros-2071411-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.119356S","chronDate":"Jan.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"3","isNumber":"5638507","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3","citationCount":"38","xplore-issue":"5638507","articleId":"5662829","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5662831,"authors":[{"name":"Kaiping Yu","affiliation":["School of Automation Science and Electrical Engineering, Beijing Aeronautics and Astronautics University, China"],"firstName":"Kaiping","lastName":"Yu","id":"37596419100"},{"name":"Fang Yang","affiliation":["DANAHER SETRA-ICG(TIANJIN) Company Limited, China"],"firstName":"Fang","lastName":"Yang","id":"37598909800"},{"name":"Hong Guo","affiliation":["School of Automation Science and Electrical Engineering, Beijing Aeronautics and Astronautics University, China"],"firstName":"Hong","lastName":"Guo","id":"37595195800"},{"name":"Jinquan Xu","affiliation":["School of Automation Science and Electrical Engineering, Beijing Aeronautics and Astronautics University, China"],"firstName":"Jinquan","lastName":"Xu","id":"37597901100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-89-86510-11-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7720-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-89-86510-12-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5662831","dbTime":"20 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":404},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Circuit faults","Artificial neural networks","Integrated circuit modeling","Mathematical model","Windings","Load modeling","Stator windings"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["brushless DC motors","electric machine analysis computing","electromagnetic actuators","fault location","neural nets","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fault diagnosis","fault location","brushless DC motor system","wavelet transform","artificial neural network","electromechanical actuator","military applications","aerospace applications","commercial applications","industrial applications","stator winding interturn short circuit fault model","open-switch fault model","open-winding fault model"]}],"abstract":"The reliability of Electro-mechanical Actuator (EMA) is extremely important in industrial, commercial, aerospace, and military applications.

It combines the independent component analysis algorithm and the adaptive particle swarm optimization, takes the negentropy of mixtures as a target function, and adaptively adjusts the inertia weight factor according to the negentropy of separated signals, and optimizes the separation matrix so as to makes each signal component independent. The simulation and experimental results on mixed speech signal showed an improved separation and a superior convergence rate of the proposed algorithm over that of PSO.

Neural networks (NNs) have become one of ideal tools in modeling nonlinear relationship between inputs and outputs. In this work, GA-LM, a neural network model combining Levenberg-Marquardt(LM) algorithm and Genetic Algorithm (GA) was developed for predicting DO in an aquaculture pond at Dalian, China. LM was used to train NNs, showing faster convergence rate. The network architecture was optimized by GA. The performance of GA-LM has been compared with that of conventional Back-Propagation (BP) algorithm and Levenberg-Marquardt(LM) algorithm. The comparison indicates that the predicted DO values using GA-LM model are in good agreement with the measured data. It is demonstrated here that the model is capable of predicting DO accurately, and can offer stronger and better performance than conventional neural networks when used as a quick interpolation and extrapolation tool.","doi":"10.1109/WISM.2010.151","startPage":"415","endPage":"419","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Web Information Systems and Mining","pdfPath":"/iel5/5661667/5662245/05662947.pdf","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Web Information Systems and Mining","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WISM.2010.151","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5662245","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Hybrid Neural Network and Genetic Algorithm Model for Predicting Dissolved Oxygen in an Aquaculture Pond","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Artificial neural networks","Predictive models","Biological system modeling","Prediction algorithms","Mathematical model","Gallium","Aquaculture"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["aquaculture","backpropagation","genetic algorithms","neural nets","oxygen"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hybrid neural network","genetic algorithm","dissolved oxygen prediction","aquaculture pond","neural networks","nonlinear relationship modeling","GA-LM","neural network model","Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm","back-propagation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["neural network (NN)","levenberg\u2013marquardt (LM) algorithm","genetic algorithm (GA)","dissolved oxygen","model"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5662947/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-24 Oct. 2010","displayDocTitle":"A Hybrid Neural Network and Genetic Algorithm Model for Predicting Dissolved Oxygen in an Aquaculture Pond","isConference":true,"volume":"1","htmlLink":"/document/5662947/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"13 January 2011","conferenceDate":"23-24 Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11794462","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Hybrid Neural Network and Genetic Algorithm Model for Predicting Dissolved Oxygen in an Aquaculture Pond","confLoc":"Sanya, China","sourcePdf":"4224a415.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069773S","chronDate":"23-24 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5661667","isNumber":"5662245","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5661667","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5662245","articleId":"5662947","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5662948,"authors":[{"name":"Yan Shen","affiliation":["College of Science, Harbin Engineering of Technology, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Yan","lastName":"Shen","id":"37592886500"},{"name":"Xianlong Ju","affiliation":["College of Science, Harbin Engineering of Technology, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Xianlong","lastName":"Ju","id":"37586275000"},{"name":"Chunxue Liu","affiliation":["College of Science, Harbin Engineering of Technology, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Chunxue","lastName":"Liu","id":"37599993700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8438-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5662948","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":296},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5662948","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Heuristic algorithms","Artificial neural networks","Nonlinear systems","Recurrent neural networks","Neurons","System identification","Approximation algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["backpropagation","nonlinear systems","recurrent neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["second order diagonal recurrent neural network identification method","nonlinear system identification","dynamic back propagation algorithm","serial-parallel identification architecture"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["second order diagonal recurrent neural network","non-linear system identification","dynamic back propagation (DBP) algorithm","momentum term","system identification"]}],"doi":"10.1109/WISM.2010.10","pdfPath":"/iel5/5661667/5662245/05662948.pdf","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Web Information Systems and Mining","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Web Information Systems and Mining","startPage":"420","endPage":"424","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5662245","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WISM.2010.10","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Application of Second Order Diagonal Recurrent Neural Network in Nonlinear System Identification","abstract":"In this paper, a kind of second order diagonal recurrent neural network (SDRNN) identification method based on dynamic back propagation(DBP) algorithm with momentum term is proposed.

Due to using programmable chips and parallel processing technology, the system has high integration, good maintenance, quick image processing speed and strong real-time capability.","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Optoelectronics and Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5661668/5662379/05663009.pdf","startPage":"417","endPage":"420","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Optoelectronics and Image Processing","doi":"10.1109/ICOIP.2010.314","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICOIP.2010.314","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5662379","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5663009","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of Multi-channel Image Superimposition System Based on FPGA","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image color analysis","Registers","Equations","Field programmable gate arrays","Pixel","Algorithm design and analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","image processing","microprocessor chips","military computing","parallel processing","weapons"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multichannel image superimposition system","field programmable gate array","infrared thermal image","mixture image","FPGA chip","multichannel DMA controller","alpha channel mixture algorithm","programmable chips","parallel processing technology","image processing"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Iimage Superimposition","Mutli-channel DMA","FPGA"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5663009/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-12 Nov. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Design of Multi-channel Image Superimposition System Based on FPGA","isConference":true,"volume":"1","htmlLink":"/document/5663009/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2010","accessionNumber":"11794748","dateOfInsertion":"13 January 2011","conferenceDate":"11-12 Nov. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of Multi-channel Image Superimposition System Based on FPGA","confLoc":"Haikou, China","sourcePdf":"4252a417.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058943S","chronDate":"11-12 Nov. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5661668","isNumber":"5662379","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5661668","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5662379","articleId":"5663009","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5663013,"authors":[{"name":"Yong-zhu Xiong","affiliation":["Institute of Resources and Environment Information Systems, Jiaying University, Meizhou, China"],"firstName":"Yong-zhu","lastName":"Xiong","id":"37536446100"},{"name":"Run Wang","affiliation":["Institute of Urban Environment, Chinese Academy and Sciences, Xiamen, China"],"firstName":"Run","lastName":"Wang","id":"37538661400"},{"name":"Zhi Li","affiliation":["Guangxi Teachers Education University, Nanning, China"],"firstName":"Zhi","lastName":"Li","id":"37597739800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8148-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4196-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5663013","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":171},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5663013","abstract":"Accurate land use/cover (LUC) classification data derived from remotely sensed data are very important for land use planning and environment sustainable development. Traditionally, statistical classifiers are often used to generate these data, but these classifiers rely on assumptions that may limit their utilities for many datasets. Conversely, artificial neural network (ANN) and decision tree (DT) classifications provide nonlinear means to extract LUC from remote sensing images without having to rely on statistical procedures or assumptions. This article used ANN and DT classifiers to extract LUC from remote sensing images which had been corrected with ancillary atmospheric and topographic data in the mountainous area of Meizhou and compared their accuracies with the statistical minimum distance (MD) classifier. Results show that the overall accuracies of LUC classifications are approximately 97.77%, 93.08% and 89.12%, and the kappa coefficients get to 0.97, 0.90 and 0.84 for the ANN, DT and MD methods, respectively, indicating that the ANN has a better accuracy than the DT and MD classifiers. It is suggested that ANN is a more effective method for remote sensing image classification of mountainous areas because of its higher accuracy and performance than DT and MD classifiers.","doi":"10.1109/IPTC.2010.127","startPage":"133","endPage":"136","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Symposium on Intelligence Information Processing and Trusted Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5661640/5662254/05663013.pdf","publicationTitle":"2010 International Symposium on Intelligence Information Processing and Trusted Computing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IPTC.2010.127","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5662254","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Extracting Land Use/Cover of Mountainous Area from Remote Sensing Images Using Artificial Neural Network and Decision Tree Classifications: A Case Study of Meizhou, China","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Artificial neural networks","Remote sensing","Accuracy","Classification algorithms","Classification tree analysis","Uncertainty"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decision trees","image classification","land use planning","neural nets","remote sensing","statistical analysis","sustainable development"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mountainous area","remote sensing images","artificial neural network","decision tree classifications","accurate land use-cover","land use planning","environment sustainable development","statistical classifiers","ancillary atmospheric data","topographic data","Meizhou","statistical minimum distance"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Artificial neural network","decision tree","remote sensing","land use/cover (LUC)","mountainous area"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5663013/","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-29 Oct. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Extracting Land Use/Cover of Mountainous Area from Remote Sensing Images Using Artificial Neural Network and Decision Tree Classifications: A Case Study of Meizhou, China","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5663013/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2010","conferenceDate":"28-29 Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11694439","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Extracting Land Use/Cover of Mountainous Area from Remote Sensing Images Using Artificial Neural Network and Decision Tree Classifications: A Case Study of Meizhou, China","confLoc":"Huanggang, China","sourcePdf":"4196a133.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06121S","chronDate":"28-29 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5661640","isNumber":"5662254","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5661640","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5662254","articleId":"5663013","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5663038,"authors":[{"name":"Guo-qiang Yu","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Engineering, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Guo-qiang","lastName":"Yu","id":"37591949900"},{"name":"Jian-an Mo","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Engineering, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Jian-an","lastName":"Mo","id":"37595980800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8148-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4196-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5663038","dbTime":"38 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":50},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Solid modeling","Data models","Reliability","Error correction","Analytical models","Mirrors","Computational modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error correction","fault tolerant computing","storage allocation","time series"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3D error correcting code","optimal time algorithm analysis","structure method","data storage"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["3-D","hamming","correction","optimal"]}],"abstract":"For improving the reliability of the data stored up, this paper brings forward an improvement scheme.

Two remedies are proposed in this paper to eliminate the one-step delay. One is based on model-based prediction, which is complex and relies much on the model; the other is based on the multiple sampling of stator current. Different from the model-based method, the stator current prediction in the second method is achieved by using linear extrapolation, which does not require the motor model. By using the one-step compensation, the torque and flux ripples are reduced effectively and the switching frequency is increased, making better use of the power converters. The two remedies are firstly simulated in Simulink, and then experimentally verified in a permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) DTC drive, validating the effectiveness of the proposed methods.","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Electrical Machines and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Electrical Machines and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5629475/5662269/05663387.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5662269","startPage":"792","endPage":"797","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of one step delay in direct torque control of permanent magnet synchronous motor and its remedies","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5663387","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of one step delay in direct torque control of permanent magnet synchronous motor and its remedies","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 Oct. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5663387/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"10-13 Oct. 2010","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11694701","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5663387/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of one step delay in direct torque control of permanent magnet synchronous motor and its remedies","confLoc":"Incheon, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"PSMD01.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051159S","chronDate":"10-13 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5629475","isNumber":"5662269","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5629475","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"5662269","articleId":"5663387","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"KIEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5663421,"authors":[{"name":"Lei Zhang","firstName":"Lei","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37088057599"},{"name":"Yi-fang Weng","firstName":"Yi-fang","lastName":"Weng","id":"37088054677"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8148-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4196-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5663421","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":112},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computer vision","Image motion analysis","Optical imaging","Optical computing","Optical sensors","Equations","Cellular neural networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular neural nets","feature extraction","image motion analysis","object detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optical flow analysis","cellular neural network","image processing","motion objects analysis","object detection"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["cellular neural networks","optical flow","image processing"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5663421","abstract":"The optical flow is widely used in detection and dynamic analysis of moving objects, but it has the heavy computational burden, so it has not been able to in the real-time progress needs.

Many companies, such as Amazon, Google, Microsoft and so on, accelerate their paces in developing Cloud Computing systems and enhancing their services to provide for a larger amount of users. However, security and privacy issues present a strong barrier for users to adapt into Cloud Computing systems. In this paper, we investigate several Cloud Computing system providers about their concerns on security and privacy issues. We find those concerns are not adequate and more should be added in terms of five aspects (i.e., availability, confidentiality, data integrity, control, audit) for security. Moreover, released acts on privacy are out of date to protect users' private information in the new environment (i.e., Cloud Computing system environment) since they are no longer applicable to the new relationship between users and providers, which contains three parties (i.e., Cloud service user, Cloud service provider/Cloud user, Cloud provider). Multi located data storage and services (i.e., applications) in the Cloud make privacy issues even worse. Hence, adapting released acts for new scenarios in the Cloud, it will result in more users to step into Cloud. We claim that the prosperity in Cloud Computing literature is to be coming after those security and privacy issues having be resolved.","doi":"10.1109/SKG.2010.19","publicationTitle":"2010 Sixth International Conference on Semantics, Knowledge and Grids","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 Sixth International Conference on Semantics, Knowledge and Grids","pdfPath":"/iel5/5661891/5663480/05663489.pdf","startPage":"105","endPage":"112","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5663480","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SKG.2010.19","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Security and Privacy in Cloud Computing: A Survey","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5663489/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 Nov. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Security and Privacy in Cloud Computing: A Survey","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5663489/","dateOfInsertion":"13 January 2011","publicationDate":"Nov. 2010","accessionNumber":"11794872","conferenceDate":"1-3 Nov. 2010","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Security and Privacy in Cloud Computing: A Survey","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"4189a105.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.080472S","chronDate":"1-3 Nov. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5661891","isNumber":"5663480","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5661891","citationCount":"212","xplore-issue":"5663480","articleId":"5663489","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5663493,"authors":[{"name":"Shifeng Shang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Technology, Tsinghua National Laboratory for Information Science and Technology, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Shifeng","lastName":"Shang","id":"37543590700"},{"name":"Jinlei Jiang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Technology, Tsinghua National Laboratory for Information Science and Technology, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jinlei","lastName":"Jiang","id":"37279092300"},{"name":"Yongwei Wu","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Technology, Tsinghua National Laboratory for Information Science and Technology, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yongwei","lastName":"Wu","id":"37281230000"},{"name":"Guangwen Yang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Technology, Tsinghua National Laboratory for Information Science and Technology, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Guangwen","lastName":"Yang","id":"37276271800"},{"name":"Weimin Zheng","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Technology, Tsinghua National Laboratory for Information Science and Technology, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Weimin","lastName":"Zheng","id":"37273477600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8125-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4189-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5663493","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":13,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":352},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Clouds","Computational modeling","Pricing","Cloud computing","Knowledge based systems","Resource management","History"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","learning (artificial intelligence)","open systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["knowledge-based continuous double auction model","Storage Networking Industry Association","cloud interoperability","global cloud resource exchange market","dynamic pricing","CDA model","learning algorithm","historical trading information","market efficiency","trading price"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cloud Market","Framework","Knowledge-based Price"]}],"abstract":"Recently, the Storage Networking Industry Association (SNIA) has released the first standard for cloud interoperability.

A robot collector leads an auction and initiates a response tree construction by transmitting the search message.

Robots wait to receive the bids from its children in the search tree. Then, robots aggregate responses by selecting the best bid and forward it back toward the robot collector (auctioning robot). When distance is used as the sole cost metrics, the traversal aggregation algorithm [routing with face traversal (RFT)-routing toward the event with the traversal of the face containing the event] can be applied and is an optimal solution.

To test the effectiveness of the transformation, the well-known Lin-Kernighan-Helsgaun heuristic was applied to the transformed ATSP.

However, to get a good locating and tracking performance the send and arrival times as well as the durations of IEEE 802.11 MAC packets must be measured precisely. In this paper, we calculate a cross-correlation between the received and sampled signal and a time continuous Barker code sequence to determine the TOA. Our adaptive sampling offset algorithm helps to efficiently obtain a subsample resolution. We implemented our algorithm and an IEEE 802.11 receiver as a Software-Defined-Radio (SDR) program. In our experiments, the algorithm needs fewer observations in comparison to previously published approaches that measure the time of flight between two WLAN devices.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5663785/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 Nov. 2010","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"8-12 Nov. 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5663785/","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2010","publicationDate":"Nov. 2010","accessionNumber":"11695404","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Precise time of flight measurements in IEEE 802.11 networks by cross-correlating the sampled signal with a continuous Barker code","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Precise time of flight measurements in IEEE 802.11 networks by cross-correlating the sampled signal with a continuous Barker code","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"MASS75.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045028S","chronDate":"8-12 Nov. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5648202","isNumber":"5663775","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5648202","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5663775","articleId":"5663785","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":5663819,"authors":[{"name":"Brandon Morton","affiliation":["Center for Intelligent Systems Research, University of Idaho, Moscow, ID, USA"],"firstName":"Brandon","lastName":"Morton","id":"37602464900"},{"name":"Terence Soule","affiliation":["Center for Intelligent Systems Research, University of Idaho, Moscow, ID, USA"],"firstName":"Terence","lastName":"Soule","id":"37331375500"},{"name":"Anthony Kanago","affiliation":["Center for Intelligent Systems Research, University of Idaho, Moscow, ID, USA"],"firstName":"Anthony","lastName":"Kanago","id":"37595280500"},{"name":"James Frenzel","affiliation":["Center for Intelligent Systems Research, University of Idaho, Moscow, ID, USA"],"firstName":"James","lastName":"Frenzel","id":"37352364800"},{"name":"Dean Edwards","affiliation":["Center for Intelligent Systems Research, University of Idaho, Moscow, ID, USA"],"firstName":"Dean","lastName":"Edwards","id":"37404092300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4332-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4333-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0197-7385"}],"articleNumber":"5663819","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":140},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5663819","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Gallium","Inspection","Heuristic algorithms","Optimization","Artificial neural networks","Turning","Algorithm design and analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","industrial robots","inspection","mobile robots","path planning","remotely operated vehicles","travelling salesman problems","underwater vehicles"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["autonomous underwater vehicle inspection locations","genetic algorithm","traveling salesman problem","autonomous navigation","path planning","underwater mine inspections","Office of Naval Research","TSP","mission-oriented operating suite","MOOS"]}],"doi":"10.1109/OCEANS.2010.5663819","pdfPath":"/iel5/5651400/5663781/05663819.pdf","publicationTitle":"OCEANS 2010 MTS/IEEE SEATTLE","displayPublicationTitle":"OCEANS 2010 MTS/IEEE SEATTLE","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5663781","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/OCEANS.2010.5663819","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Ordering autonomous underwater vehicle inspection locations with a genetic algorithm","abstract":"This paper describes a genetic algorithm for solving the traveling salesman problem (TSP) for autonomous navigation. The method is applied to autonomous underwater vehicles for efficient path planning during underwater mine inspections, sponsored by the Office of Naval Research. This method is significantly easier to implement and much more extensible to real world variants of TSP, e.g. problems incorporating currents, limited turning radius, limitations in depth changes, etc., than other, more efficient, approaches. A specific case study demonstrates a variation accounting for constant currents. Performance is compared against existing behaviors for path planning implemented in the Mission-Oriented Operating Suite (MOOS). The results show that the genetic algorithm performs significantly better than the approach currently implemented in MOOS and successfully accounts for factors such as currents.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 Sept. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5663819/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11695760","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5663819/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2010","conferenceDate":"20-23 Sept. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Ordering autonomous underwater vehicle inspection locations with a genetic algorithm","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ordering autonomous underwater vehicle inspection locations with a genetic algorithm","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"100604019.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050431S","chronDate":"20-23 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5651400","isNumber":"5663781","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5651400","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5663781","articleId":"5663819","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5663839,"authors":[{"name":"Jordi Ribas","affiliation":["Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Jordi","lastName":"Ribas","id":"37592385700"},{"name":"Daniel Sura","affiliation":["Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Daniel","lastName":"Sura","id":"37594877700"},{"name":"Milica Stojanovic","affiliation":["Northeastern University, Boston, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Milica","lastName":"Stojanovic","id":"37266493500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4332-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4333-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0197-7385"}],"articleNumber":"5663839","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":35,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":632},"abstract":"We study the feasibility of video transmission using an acoustic system for deep-sea oilfield supervisory control and inspection.

Experimental testing was conducted at the MIT Sailing Pavilion premises, in the Charles River, Boston. The results demonstrate the usefulness of the coupled MPEG-4 compression and OFDM modulation, reaching bit rates on the order of 90 kbps in a 115 kHz acoustic band over a 200-meter link under a variety of channel conditions.","displayPublicationTitle":"OCEANS 2010 MTS/IEEE SEATTLE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5651400/5663781/05663839.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"9","publicationTitle":"OCEANS 2010 MTS/IEEE SEATTLE","doi":"10.1109/OCEANS.2010.5663839","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/OCEANS.2010.5663839","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5663781","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5663839","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Underwater wireless video transmission for supervisory control and inspection using acoustic OFDM","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Noise","Acoustics","Transform coding","Bit rate","Coherence","Image coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["acoustic imaging","data communication","inspection","OFDM modulation","underwater sound","video coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["underwater wireless video transmission","supervisory control and inspection","acoustic OFDM","deep sea oilfield","video compression","MPEG-4 compression"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5663839/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 Sept. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Underwater wireless video transmission for supervisory control and inspection using acoustic OFDM","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5663839/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11695766","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2010","conferenceDate":"20-23 Sept. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Underwater wireless video transmission for supervisory control and inspection using acoustic OFDM","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"100323003.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053178S","chronDate":"20-23 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5651400","isNumber":"5663781","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5651400","citationCount":"35","xplore-issue":"5663781","articleId":"5663839","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":5663849,"authors":[{"name":"Roald Otnes","affiliation":["Norwegian Defence Research Establishment, Norway"],"firstName":"Roald","lastName":"Otnes","id":"37273437900"},{"name":"Nanna Skjei","affiliation":["Kongsberg Defence and Aerospace, Norway"],"firstName":"Nanna","lastName":"Skjei","id":"37595115200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4332-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4333-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0197-7385"}],"articleNumber":"5663849","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":174},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sonar equipment","Interpolation","Array signal processing","Receivers","Phased arrays","Manifolds"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","interpolation","nonlinear acoustics","reverberation","sonar arrays","sonar detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["beamforming","nonlinear sonar arrays","projection based tapering method","array interpolation method","LASAR40 diver detection sonar","reverberation"]}],"abstract":"We propose a projection-based tapering method for conventional beamforming on nonlinear sonar arrays.

Under this model, the receiver assumes a simplified structure in which conventional Alamouti data detection and channel estimation are aided by Doppler tracking. System performance is demonstrated using experimental data transmitted over a 1 km shallow water channel in the 8-18 kHz acoustic band, using QPSK modulation and a varying number of carriers (up to 1024).

In typical operations, AUVs are programmed to follow pre-defined geo-referenced trajectories, while collecting the relevant information about the underwater environment, with a clear separation between navigation and payload sensors. Under the adaptive sampling paradigm, the AUVs are able to interpret some of the payload data in order to change the sampling pattern and concentrate measurements in the regions of interest. In this paper, we describe an implementation of such paradigm, in which a small sized AUV is able to process CTD data, in real time, and change depth in order to maintain tracking of the thermocline region. We demonstrate the developed algorithms with data from field experiments in a dam reservoir, which show a very good performance, even in very shallow waters with hardly detectable features.

We have developed an optical communication system that complements and integrates with an acoustic system to provide underwater communications that is capable of high data-rates and low latency in clear water combined with long range and robustness in the presence of high turbidity. This combined optical/acoustic telemetry technology was recently tested at a CORK (Circulation Obviation Retrofit Kit) borehole observatory in the deep ocean of northeast Pacific. A CORK is a seafloor system to seal a borehole from the overlying ocean to allow the subseafloor hydrologic regime within the sediments and volcanic basement to retain its pre-drilling pressure state. CORKs are instrumented with downhole thermistor strings and pressure sensors and are typically visited on a semi-regular basis by submersible for downloading data and for collecting physical samples of subsurface fluids. We deployed the Optical Telemetry System (OTS) at the Hole 857D CORK in 2420 m water depth using the submersible ALVIN in July, 2010. The OTS was plugged into the existing underwater connector on the CORK to provide not only an optical and acoustic communication interface but also additional data storage and battery power for the CORK to sample at an increased 1 Hz data-rate. Using a CTD-mounted OTS similar to the seafloor unit we were able to establish an optical communication link at a range of 100 meters at rates of 1, 5 and 10 mega bits per second (Mbps) with no bit errors. Subsequent tests were done to establish the optical range of the various data rates and the optical power of the system. After approximately 1 week we repeated the CTD-OTS experiment and downloaded 20 Mb of data over a 5 Mbps link at a range of 80 m. The CORK-OTS will remain installed at the CORK for a year. Our Optical Telemetry System (OTS) enables faster data rates to be employed for in situ measurements that were previously limited by data download times from a submersible. The OTS also permits non submersible-equipped vessels to interrogate the CORK borehole observatory on a more frequent basis using a receiver lowered by wire from a ship of opportunity. In the future, autonomous vehicles could interrogate such seafloor observatories in a \"data-mule\" configuration and then dock at a seafloor cabled node to download data. While borehole observatories may ultimately be linked into undersea cables relaying real-time data back to shore they represent a superb opportunity to test free water optical communication methods. This application of seafloor optical communication could be used for a number of other types of seafloor sensors that may not be linked into a cabled network. The lessons learned from our CORK development efforts will go a long way towards establishing the viability of underwater optical communications for a host of autonomous seafloor sensor systems in the future.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5663951/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 Sept. 2010","publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"20-23 Sept. 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5663951/","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2010","accessionNumber":"11695615","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Optical communication system expands CORK seafloor observatory's bandwidth","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optical communication system expands CORK seafloor observatory's bandwidth","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"100608003.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054279S","chronDate":"20-23 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5651400","isNumber":"5663781","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5651400","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"5663781","articleId":"5663951","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5663960,"authors":[{"name":"Jialu Fan","affiliation":["Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA, USA","State Key Laboratory of Industrial Control Technology, University of Zhejiang, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Jialu","lastName":"Fan","id":"37589917900"},{"name":"Yuan Du","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Industrial Control Technology, University of Zhejiang, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Yuan","lastName":"Du","id":"37596135700"},{"name":"Wei Gao","affiliation":["Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Gao","id":"37307925500"},{"name":"Jiming Chen","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Industrial Control Technology, University of Zhejiang, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Jiming","lastName":"Chen","id":"37280686900"},{"name":"Youxian Sun","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Industrial Control Technology, University of Zhejiang, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Youxian","lastName":"Sun","id":"37278742100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7490-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7488-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-7489-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2155-6814"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2155-6806"},{"format":"CD","value":"2155-6806"}],"articleNumber":"5663960","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":25,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":475},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Communities","Mobile communication","Social network services","Mobile computing","Computational modeling","Markov processes","Steady-state"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["geography","information dissemination","Markov processes","mobile computing","social networking (online)","travelling salesman problems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["geography-aware active data dissemination","mobile social networks","end-to-end connectivity","semi-Markov analytical model","combinational optimization","convex optimization","traveling salesman problem"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5663960","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Geography-aware active data dissemination in mobile social networks","doi":"10.1109/MASS.2010.5663960","startPage":"109","endPage":"118","publicationTitle":"The 7th IEEE International Conference on Mobile Ad-hoc and Sensor Systems (IEEE MASS 2010)","displayPublicationTitle":"The 7th IEEE International Conference on Mobile Ad-hoc and Sensor Systems (IEEE MASS 2010)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5648202/5663775/05663960.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5663775","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MASS.2010.5663960","abstract":"In mobile social networks (MSNets), data dissemination is an important topic, which has not been widely investigated yet. Active data dissemination is a networking paradigm where a superuser intentionally facilitates the connectivity in the network. One of the key challenges under this paradigm is how to design the most efficient superuser route to achieve certain properties of end-to-end connectivity. Most existing solutions only focus on the network with stationary users or strongly constrained node mobility, and assume the superuser always moves with a fixed route. In this paper, we propose a flexible approach to design the superuser routes, considering the realistic user movements in MSNets. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to study active data dissemination from the social network perspective. We explore the geographic regularity of human mobility in the network, employ a semi-Markov analytical model to describe such mobility pattern, and hence formulate the superuser route design as a combinational optimization problem of Convex Optimization and Traveling Salesman Problem by exploiting social network concepts including communities and centrality. Extensive trace-driven simulations show that our approach consistently outperforms other existing superuser route design algorithms in terms of delivery ratio and energy efficiency.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5663960/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 Nov. 2010","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2010","accessionNumber":"11695352","publicationDate":"Nov. 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5663960/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"8-12 Nov. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Geography-aware active data dissemination in mobile social networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Geography-aware active data dissemination in mobile social networks","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"MASS12.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073285S","chronDate":"8-12 Nov. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5648202","isNumber":"5663775","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5648202","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"5663775","articleId":"5663960","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5663968,"authors":[{"name":"An Liu","affiliation":["North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC, USA"],"firstName":"An","lastName":"Liu","id":"37308405500"},{"name":"Peng Ning","affiliation":["North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC, USA"],"firstName":"Peng","lastName":"Ning","id":"37269721200"},{"name":"Huaiyu Dai","affiliation":["North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC, USA"],"firstName":"Huaiyu","lastName":"Dai","id":"37335980600"},{"name":"Yao Liu","affiliation":["North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC, USA"],"firstName":"Yao","lastName":"Liu","id":"37405185600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7490-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7488-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-7489-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2155-6814"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2155-6806"},{"format":"CD","value":"2155-6806"}],"articleNumber":"5663968","dbTime":"19 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":29,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":476},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Jamming","Receivers","DH-HEMTs","Spread spectrum communication","Wireless communication","Protocols","Transceivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frequency hop communication","jamming","protocols","spread spectrum communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["USD-FH","jamming-resistant wireless communication","uncoordinated seed disclosure","spread spectrum techniques","direct sequence spread spectrum","DSSS","antijamming wireless communications","communicating devices","shared secret before communication","uncoordinated frequency hopping","UFH","secret key","Diffie-Hellman key establishment protocol","DH key establishment message","one-time pseudo-random hopping pattern"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Anti-jamming Wireless Communication","Frequency Hopping","Spread Spectrum"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5663968","doi":"10.1109/MASS.2010.5663968","publicationTitle":"The 7th IEEE International Conference on Mobile Ad-hoc and Sensor Systems (IEEE MASS 2010)","abstract":"Spread spectrum techniques (e.g., Frequency Hopping (FH), Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum (DSSS)) have been widely used for anti-jamming wireless communications. Such techniques require that communicating devices agree on a shared secret before communication. However, it is non-trivial for two devices that do not share any secret to establish one in presence of a jammer. Recently, several schemes relying on Uncoordinated Frequency Hopping (UFH) were proposed to allow two devices to establish a secret key using Diffie-Hellman (DH) key establishment protocol in presence of jammers. Unfortunately, all these schemes are limited in efficiency. In this paper, we propose a novel scheme named USD-FH, which uses Uncoordinated Seed Disclosure in Frequency Hopping to establish a shared secret in presence of jammers. The basic idea is to transmit each DH key establishment message using a one-time pseudo-random hopping pattern and disclose the corresponding seed in an uncoordinated manner before the actual message. Due to the large number of channels available for wireless communication, the jammers cannot control all channels at the same time. When the receiver and the sender use the same channel during seed disclosure, the receiver can get the seed. If the jammer does not listen on the same channel (and thus it does not know the hopping pattern), the receiver can receive the actual message without being jammed. We validate USD-FH through both theoretical analysis and simulation. Our results show that USD-FH is much more efficient and robust than previous solutions.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MASS.2010.5663968","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5663775","startPage":"41","endPage":"50","displayPublicationTitle":"The 7th IEEE International Conference on Mobile Ad-hoc and Sensor Systems (IEEE MASS 2010)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5648202/5663775/05663968.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"USD-FH: Jamming-resistant wireless communication using Frequency Hopping with Uncoordinated Seed Disclosure","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5663968/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 Nov. 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5663968/","displayDocTitle":"USD-FH: Jamming-resistant wireless communication using Frequency Hopping with Uncoordinated Seed Disclosure","conferenceDate":"8-12 Nov. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2010","accessionNumber":"11695357","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"USD-FH: Jamming-resistant wireless communication using Frequency Hopping with Uncoordinated Seed Disclosure","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"MASS05.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072025S","chronDate":"8-12 Nov. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5648202","isNumber":"5663775","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5648202","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"5663775","articleId":"5663968","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5663971,"authors":[{"name":"Shan Chu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Stony Brook University, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Shan","lastName":"Chu","id":"37402859400"},{"name":"Xin Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Stony Brook University, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Xin","lastName":"Wang","id":"37293614100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7490-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7488-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-7489-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2155-6814"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2155-6806"},{"format":"CD","value":"2155-6806"}],"articleNumber":"5663971","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":452},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","MIMO","Transmitting antennas","Multiplexing","Receivers","Ad hoc networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["access protocols","ad hoc networks","antenna arrays","diversity reception","MIMO systems","mobile computing","multiplexing","scheduling","telecommunication network reliability","telecommunication signalling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive exploitation","high performance communications","MIMO ad hoc networks","wireless devices","storage resources","mobile computing techniques","mobile computing capability","network throughput","transmission reliability","multiple-input-multiple-output technology","MIMO technology","multiantenna arrays","MIMO technique","diversity transmission","cooperative relay transmission","single antenna environment","MIMO-based ad hoc network","distributed scheduling algorithms","cooperative multiplexing gain","cooperative diversity gain","channel conditions","scheduling scheme","signaling overhead","conventional relay schemes","multiplexed MIMO transmission","MAC protocol","distributed algorithm","MIMO framework","node density","link failure ratio","packet arrival rate","retransmission threshold"]}],"abstract":"With the popularity of wireless devices and the increase of computing and storage resources, there are increasing interests in supporting mobile computing techniques. Particularly, ad hoc networks can potentially connect different wireless devices to enable more powerful wireless applications and mobile computing capabilities. To meet the ever increasing communication need, it is important to improve the network throughput while guaranteeing transmission reliability. Multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) technology can provide significantly higher data rate in ad hoc networks where nodes are equipped with multi-antenna arrays. Although MIMO technique itself can support diversity transmission when channel condition degrades, the use of diversity transmission often compromises the multiplexing gain and is also not enough to deal with extremely weak channel. Instead, in this work, we exploit the use of cooperative relay transmission (which is often used in a single antenna environment to improve reliability) in a MIMO-based ad hoc network to cope with harsh channel condition. We design both centralized and distributed scheduling algorithms to support adaptive use of cooperative relay transmission. Our algorithm effectively exploits the cooperative multiplexing gain and cooperative diversity gain to achieve higher data rate and higher reliability under various channel conditions. Our scheduling scheme can efficiently invoke relay transmission without introducing significant signaling overhead as conventional relay schemes, and seamlessly integrate relay transmission with multiplexed MIMO transmission. We also design a MAC protocol to implement the distributed algorithm. Our performance results demonstrate that the use of cooperative relay in a MIMO framework could bring in a significant throughput improvement in all the scenarios studied, with the variation of node density, link failure ratio, packet arrival rate and retransmission threshold.","doi":"10.1109/MASS.2010.5663971","publicationTitle":"The 7th IEEE International Conference on Mobile Ad-hoc and Sensor Systems (IEEE MASS 2010)","displayPublicationTitle":"The 7th IEEE International Conference on Mobile Ad-hoc and Sensor Systems (IEEE MASS 2010)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5648202/5663775/05663971.pdf","startPage":"21","endPage":"30","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MASS.2010.5663971","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5663775","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive exploitation of cooperative relay for high performance communications in MIMO ad hoc networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5663971","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 Nov. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5663971/","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive exploitation of cooperative relay for high performance communications in MIMO ad hoc networks","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2010","accessionNumber":"11695359","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5663971/","conferenceDate":"8-12 Nov. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive exploitation of cooperative relay for high performance communications in MIMO ad hoc networks","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"MASS03.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.082142S","chronDate":"8-12 Nov. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5648202","isNumber":"5663775","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5648202","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5663775","articleId":"5663971","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5663975,"authors":[{"name":"Dawei Gong","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Dawei","lastName":"Gong","id":"37530301900"},{"name":"Miao Zhao","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Miao","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37292301100"},{"name":"Yuanyuan Yang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Yuanyuan","lastName":"Yang","id":"37280588900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7490-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7488-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-7489-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2155-6814"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2155-6806"},{"format":"CD","value":"2155-6806"}],"articleNumber":"5663975","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":816},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Wireless sensor networks","Media Access Protocol","Clustering algorithms","Synchronization","Interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["access protocols","cooperative communication","MIMO systems","wireless channels","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multichannel cooperative MIMO MAC protocol","wireless sensor networks","multichannel MAC protocols","WSN","network capacity","energy efficiency","cooperative multiple-input multiple-output technique","promising techniques","multiple channels","cluster head","cooperative nodes","cooperative MIMO technique","intra-cluster communications","adjacent clusters","inter-cluster communications","cooperative MIMO links","concurrent transmissions"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Wireless sensor networks (WSNs)","multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)","cooperative MIMO","channel assignment","medium access control (MAC)"]}],"abstract":"Recently, several multi-channel MAC protocols have been proposed for wireless sensor networks (WSNs) to improve network capacity and boost energy efficiency. In addition, cooperative multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) technique has been shown to be able to significantly enhance the energy efficiency of WSNs if properly configured. However, these two promising techniques have not been jointly utilized in WSNs. In this paper, we explore such a joint design by proposing a novel MAC protocol for WSNs that takes advantage of both multiple channels and cooperative MIMO. Specifically, sensor nodes in a WSN are organized into clusters and each cluster head selects some cooperative nodes to help forward traffic to or receive from other clusters by utilizing cooperative MIMO technique. For intra-cluster communications, different channels are assigned to adjacent clusters to reduce collisions, while for inter-cluster communications, cooperative MIMO links are scheduled to improve energy efficiency and concurrent transmissions are enabled by assigning different channels to them. We carry out extensive simulations and the results demonstrate that the proposed protocol can significantly increase throughput and improve energy efficiency compared to other schemes. For example, for a WSN with 150 nodes in a 250m \u00d7 250m field, with five or more available channels, the protocol can achieve over three times saturated throughput while saving up to 17% energy per bit for inter-cluster communications.","doi":"10.1109/MASS.2010.5663975","publicationTitle":"The 7th IEEE International Conference on Mobile Ad-hoc and Sensor Systems (IEEE MASS 2010)","displayPublicationTitle":"The 7th IEEE International Conference on Mobile Ad-hoc and Sensor Systems (IEEE MASS 2010)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5648202/5663775/05663975.pdf","startPage":"11","endPage":"20","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MASS.2010.5663975","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5663775","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A multi-channel cooperative MIMO MAC protocol for wireless sensor networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5663975","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 Nov. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5663975/","displayDocTitle":"A multi-channel cooperative MIMO MAC protocol for wireless sensor networks","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2010","accessionNumber":"11695362","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5663975/","conferenceDate":"8-12 Nov. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A multi-channel cooperative MIMO MAC protocol for wireless sensor networks","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"MASS02.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061157S","chronDate":"8-12 Nov. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5648202","isNumber":"5663775","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5648202","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"5663775","articleId":"5663975","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5664094,"authors":[{"name":"Philippe Courmontagne","affiliation":["Maison des Technologies, Equipe Signaux et Systemes, Toulon, France"],"firstName":"Philippe","lastName":"Courmontagne","id":"37563316000"},{"name":"Gregory Julien","affiliation":["Maison des Technologies, Equipe Signaux et Systemes, Toulon, France"],"firstName":"Gregory","lastName":"Julien","id":"37587522600"},{"name":"Marie Edith Bouhier","affiliation":["Maison des Technologies, Equipe Signaux et Systemes, Toulon, France"],"firstName":"Marie Edith","lastName":"Bouhier","id":"37603765800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4332-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4333-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0197-7385"}],"articleNumber":"5664094","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":192},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5664094","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Signal to noise ratio","Time frequency analysis","Chirp","Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","Matched filters","Noise measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["band-pass filters","matched filters","pulse compression","pulse modulation","signal denoising","stochastic processes","time-frequency analysis","transient response"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["time frequency domain","stochastic matched filter pulse compression scheme","high speed computing architecture","engineering technology","noise corrupted received signal","matched filter theory","bandpass transmitted pulse compression","matched filter impulse response","SMF-PC"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Pulse-compression","matched filter","stochastic matched filter","Wigner-Ville transform","linear chirp"]}],"abstract":"In several domains of engineering technologies, such as telecommunication, sonar imaging, positioning systems, radar, medical imaging ..., the main problem is to identify a transmitted useful pulse in a noise-corrupted received signal. A solution to this problem consists in using a modulated pulse for emission and a matched filter for reception. Such a concept is known as pulse-compression. Taking into account the main assumptions of the matched filter theory, the use of the bandpass transmitted pulse as matched filter's impulse response is only available if the useful signal is well known and if the noise is white, which is not the case in practice. For this reason, it has been recently proposed an alternative to the classical pulse-compression scheme taking into account the random nature of the useful signal and the coloration of the noise. This new principle is known as the SMF-PC. Although, this method allows a great improvement in terms of signal to noise ratio compared to the classical pulse-compression technique, the SMF-PC appears under optimal due to stationary assumptions. In this context, the purpose of this paper is to propose an improvement of the SMF-PC by coupling this technique with a time-frequency method. Results obtained on synthetic and real data are proposed and discussed.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5663781","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/OCEANS.2010.5664094","publicationTitle":"OCEANS 2010 MTS/IEEE SEATTLE","displayPublicationTitle":"OCEANS 2010 MTS/IEEE SEATTLE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5651400/5663781/05664094.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"10","doi":"10.1109/OCEANS.2010.5664094","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the use of time-frequency domains for the improvement of the Stochastic Matched Filter Pulse Compression scheme with a high speed computing architecture","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 Sept. 2010","displayDocTitle":"On the use of time-frequency domains for the improvement of the Stochastic Matched Filter Pulse Compression scheme with a high speed computing architecture","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"20-23 Sept. 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5664094/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11695499","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5664094/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the use of time-frequency domains for the improvement of the Stochastic Matched Filter Pulse Compression scheme with a high speed computing architecture","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"100604008.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067875S","chronDate":"20-23 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5651400","isNumber":"5663781","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5651400","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5663781","articleId":"5664094","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5664108,"authors":[{"name":"Shichuan Ding","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, South-East University, Nanjing, China","Department of Automation, Anhui University, Hefei, China"],"firstName":"Shichuan","lastName":"Ding","id":"37590772500"},{"name":"Ming Cheng","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, South-East University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Ming","lastName":"Cheng","id":"37272480000"},{"name":"Zheng Wang","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, South-East University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Zheng","lastName":"Wang","id":"37279253500"},{"name":"K.

This paper presents a detailed evaluation of a detector based on Fractional Fourier Transform (henceforth shortened as FrFT) for detecting chirps. The motivation behind the proposed evaluation is the inherent ability of FrFT, to process chirp signals better than the conventional Fourier Transform. Performance of FrFT detector is compared with conventional FFT and Energy detectors, in the presence of white Gaussian noise as well as 1/f noise. Our simulations clearly show that the FrFT based detector outperforms the other two detectors and improvements above 10 dB are possible.","doi":"10.1109/SYMPOL.2009.5664136","publicationTitle":"2009 International Symposium on Ocean Electronics (SYMPOL 2009)","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Symposium on Ocean Electronics (SYMPOL 2009)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5656077/5664117/05664136.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SYMPOL.2009.5664136","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5664117","startPage":"56","endPage":"65","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fractional Fourier Transform based chirp detector versus some conventional detectors","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5664136","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Fractional Fourier Transform based chirp detector versus some conventional detectors","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 Nov. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5664136/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"18-20 Nov. 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","accessionNumber":"11694220","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5664136/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fractional Fourier Transform based chirp detector versus some conventional detectors","confLoc":"Cochin, India","sourcePdf":"23ResearchSessionIIPaper3.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052258S","chronDate":"18-20 Nov. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5656077","isNumber":"5664117","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5656077","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5664117","articleId":"5664136","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5664146,"authors":[{"name":"Yongwoo Park","affiliation":["Institut National de la Recherche Scientifique \u2013 Energie, Mat\u00e9riaux et T\u00e9l\u00e9communications (INRS-EMT), Varennes, Qu\u00e9bec, Canada"],"firstName":"Yongwoo","lastName":"Park","id":"37311461400"},{"name":"Jos\u00e9 Aza\u00f1a","affiliation":["Institut National de la Recherche Scientifique \u2013 Energie, Mat\u00e9riaux et T\u00e9l\u00e9communications (INRS-EMT), Varennes, Qu\u00e9bec, Canada"],"firstName":"Jos\u00e9","lastName":"Aza\u00f1a","id":"37278316500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7825-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7824-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-7823-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5664146","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":93},"abstract":"We experimentally achieve microwave dispersions approaching 24ns/GHz (equivalent to the dispersion of ~185,000-km of standard single-mode fiber) using a fiber-optic incoherent processing setup.

Taking the performance margin of the transmitter and receiver into consideration, we believe that even up to 20-Gbps data can be transmitted.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Terahertz wireless communication link at 300 GHz","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Topical Meeting on Microwave Photonics","doi":"10.1109/MWP.2010.5664230","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Topical Meeting on Microwave Photonics","pdfPath":"/iel5/5643975/5663979/05664230.pdf","startPage":"42","endPage":"45","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWP.2010.5664230","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5663979","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5664230","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5664230/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-9 Oct. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Terahertz wireless communication link at 300 GHz","conferenceDate":"5-9 Oct. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5664230/","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2010","publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11695087","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Terahertz wireless communication link at 300 GHz","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"WE32.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056287S","chronDate":"5-9 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5643975","isNumber":"5663979","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5643975","citationCount":"66","xplore-issue":"5663979","articleId":"5664230","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-31"},{"_id":5664253,"authors":[{"name":"E.

The objective of this paper is to propose an algorithm of three-dimensional distributed range-free localization for WSNs, using an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) equipped with a rotary and tilting directional antenna. This algorithm, denominated as the three-dimensional azimuthally defined area localization algorithm (3D-ADAL), is executed in each sensor node and is based only on the analysis of the information received from the UAV, therefore is energy efficient and contributes to extend the lifetime of the sensor network. Additionally the proposed algorithm has the advantage of being simple and economical.

Without altering the signal design, a time-domain equalizer (TEQ) can be applied at the receiver to shorten the channel for IBI suppression. In this paper we study several known designs of blind channel shortening in the ZP-OFDM context, exploiting the signal redundancy in the form of guard zeros in the time domain, or null subcarriers in the frequency domain, or both. Numerical results show that blind channel shortening algorithms can catch up or even exceed the performance of a benchmark scheme assuming perfect channel knowledge. Only time-invariant channels are considered in this paper; channel shortening for time-varying channels with large delay spreads such as underwater acoustic channels is an interesting subject that warrants further investigation.","doi":"10.1109/OCEANS.2010.5664371","publicationTitle":"OCEANS 2010 MTS/IEEE SEATTLE","displayPublicationTitle":"OCEANS 2010 MTS/IEEE SEATTLE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5651400/5663781/05664371.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/OCEANS.2010.5664371","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5663781","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Blind channel shortening for zero-padded OFDM","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5664371","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 Sept. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5664371/","displayDocTitle":"Blind channel shortening for zero-padded OFDM","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11695587","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5664371/","conferenceDate":"20-23 Sept. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Blind channel shortening for zero-padded OFDM","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"100515008.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050156S","chronDate":"20-23 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5651400","isNumber":"5663781","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5651400","xplore-issue":"5663781","articleId":"5664371","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5664374,"authors":[{"name":"Thomas Helzel","affiliation":["Helzel Messtechnik GmbH, Kaltenkirchen, Germany"],"firstName":"Thomas","lastName":"Helzel","id":"37563315800"},{"name":"Matthias Kniephoff","affiliation":["Helzel Messtechnik GmbH, Kaltenkirchen, Germany"],"firstName":"Matthias","lastName":"Kniephoff","id":"37592273100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4332-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4333-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0197-7385"}],"articleNumber":"5664374","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":145},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radar","Arrays","Oceans","Radar antennas","Accuracy","Linear antenna arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["geophysical signal processing","oceanographic techniques","remote sensing by radar"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["software beam forming","ocean radar WERA features","remote sensing system","ocean surface currents","wind direction","short radio wave radar technology","vertical polarised electromagnetic wave","back-scattered signals","Bragg effect","phase measurements","ocean radar applications","radar site planing"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Software beam forming for ocean radar WERA features and accuracy","doi":"10.1109/OCEANS.2010.5664374","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5663781","endPage":"3","publicationTitle":"OCEANS 2010 MTS/IEEE SEATTLE","displayPublicationTitle":"OCEANS 2010 MTS/IEEE SEATTLE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5651400/5663781/05664374.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/OCEANS.2010.5664374","startPage":"1","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5664374","abstract":"The WERA system (WavE RAdar) is a shore based remote sensing system to monitor ocean surface currents, waves and wind direction.

The vertical polarised electromagnetic wave is coupled to the conductive ocean surface and follows the curvature of the earth. This over the horizon oceanography radar can pick up back-scattered signals from the rough ocean surface (Bragg effect) from ranges of up to 200 km. The direction in azimuth is defined by means of the phase of the incoming electro-magnetic wave. That means the accuracy of this measured azimuth strongly depends on the quality of this phase measurements. The described Software Beam Forming method combines best accuracy with the highest temporal resolution for ocean radar applications. Compared with other beam forming methods the flexibility of this method provides more degrees of freedom for the radar site planing and makes it much easier to identify suited site locations.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5664374/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 Sept. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2010","accessionNumber":"11695589","htmlLink":"/document/5664374/","conferenceDate":"20-23 Sept. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Software beam forming for ocean radar WERA features and accuracy","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Software beam forming for ocean radar WERA features and accuracy","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"100515005.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073066S","chronDate":"20-23 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5651400","isNumber":"5663781","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5651400","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"5663781","articleId":"5664374","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":5664379,"authors":[{"name":"Vanxay Phimmasone","affiliation":["Graduate School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Sophia University, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Vanxay","lastName":"Phimmasone","id":"37592267900"},{"name":"Yuta Kondo","affiliation":["Graduate School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Sophia University, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Yuta","lastName":"Kondo","id":"37595392800"},{"name":"Takayoshi Kamejima","affiliation":["Graduate School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Sophia University, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Takayoshi","lastName":"Kamejima","id":"37602847300"},{"name":"Masafumi Miyatake","affiliation":["Department of Engineering and applied Science, Sophia University, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Masafumi","lastName":"Miyatake","id":"37270892000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-89-86510-11-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7720-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-89-86510-12-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5664379","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1590},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Arrays","Photovoltaic systems","Particle swarm optimization","Voltage control","Radiation effects"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["maximum power point trackers","particle swarm optimisation","power generation control","solar power stations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["extracted energy","PSO based MPPT","solar irradiation change","maximum power point tracking control","photovoltaic generator","particle swarm optimization"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Maximum Power Point Tracker","Multidimensional optimization","Photovoltaic array","Particle Swarm Optimization"]}],"abstract":"This paper deals with Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) control of photovoltaic (PV) generators.

However, the long delay spread characteristic of UAC channels makes the equalization challenging for those MIMO schemes. Although maximum likelihood sequence estimation (MLSE) is known to be optimum and is intensively used in many terrestrial wireless applications, it is not applicable for UAC channels since the computational complexity of MLSE increases exponentially with the number of channel taps. This paper presents an iterative reduced state MLSE scheme for MIMO UAC by taking advantage of the inherent line-of-sight feature of UAC channels. The proposed scheme spans the MLSE state space only from the dominant UAC channel taps and iteratively eliminates the residual inter-symbol interference (ISI) caused by the weak taps. Both Viterbi algorithm (VA) and sphere decoder (SD) are adopted in the proposed iterative MLSE. Analytical and numerical results are given to evaluate the performance of this scheme. Sea experiment results are also provided to further verify the performance of our proposed scheme. The proposed approach achieves 1.07% uncoded bit error rate (BER) with 2 transducers in SPACE08 sea experiment at a 1000m distance.","displayPublicationTitle":"OCEANS 2010 MTS/IEEE SEATTLE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5651400/5663781/05664399.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"OCEANS 2010 MTS/IEEE SEATTLE","doi":"10.1109/OCEANS.2010.5664399","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/OCEANS.2010.5664399","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5663781","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5664399","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Iterative MLSE for MIMO underwater acoustic channels","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Maximum likelihood estimation","Bit error rate","Transducers","Delay","MIMO","Interference","Channel estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decoding","maximum likelihood sequence estimation","MIMO communication","underwater acoustic communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["iterative MLSE","MIMO","underwater acoustic channels","maximum likelihood sequence estimation","intersymbol interference","Viterbi algorithm","sphere decoder"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5664399/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 Sept. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Iterative MLSE for MIMO underwater acoustic channels","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5664399/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11695609","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2010","conferenceDate":"20-23 Sept. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Iterative MLSE for MIMO underwater acoustic channels","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"100528028.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058117S","chronDate":"20-23 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5651400","isNumber":"5663781","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5651400","xplore-issue":"5663781","articleId":"5664399","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5664428,"authors":[{"name":"Nicholas Carlevaris-Bianco","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA"],"firstName":"Nicholas","lastName":"Carlevaris-Bianco","id":"38271867200"},{"name":"Anush Mohan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA"],"firstName":"Anush","lastName":"Mohan","id":"38270932200"},{"name":"Ryan M.

In this paper we present an algorithm for removing the effects of light scattering, referred to as dehazing, in underwater images. Our key contribution is to propose a simple, yet effective, prior that exploits the strong difference in attenuation between the three image color channels in water to estimate the depth of the scene. We then use this estimate to reduce the spatially varying effect of haze in the image. Our method works with a single image and does not require any specialized hardware or prior knowledge of the scene. As a by-product of the dehazing process, an up-to-scale depth map of the scene is produced.

The SNR traces we consider are part of the SubNet'09 experimental dataset, and have been derived by processing an hyperbolic frequency-modulated signal in the 9-14 kHz band. We start by deriving the high level behavior of the channel in terms of the statistics of channel fading effects, which are found to be well modeled by a Nakagami-m distribution, where the parameter m is estimated over a whole experiment or over smaller time windows throughout the experiment, depending on the variability of the SNR. The statistics of the channel behavior are then used to derive the performance of a variable-rate modulation scheme switching between five different constellations; the cases of both instantaneous and outdated channel knowledge are considered. Analytical results are compared to simulations to show that the Nakagami-m distribution can satisfactorily capture the statistics of the channel, provided that the estimation of the m parameter, as well as of the correlation of the SNR process, is repeated in case of macroscopic channel variations.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/OCEANS.2010.5664467","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5663781","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","displayPublicationTitle":"OCEANS 2010 MTS/IEEE SEATTLE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5651400/5663781/05664467.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance study of variable-rate modulation for underwater communications based on experimental data","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5664467/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 Sept. 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5664467/","displayDocTitle":"Performance study of variable-rate modulation for underwater communications based on experimental data","conferenceDate":"20-23 Sept. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11695700","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance study of variable-rate modulation for underwater communications based on experimental data","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"100528038.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059927S","chronDate":"20-23 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5651400","isNumber":"5663781","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5651400","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"5663781","articleId":"5664467","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5664470,"authors":[{"name":"Charmane V.

However, since UUVs have nonlinear and highly coupled dynamics, motion planning and control can be difficult when completing complex tasks. Introducing models into the motion planning process can produce paths the vehicle can feasibly traverse. As a result, Sampling-Based Model Predictive Control (SBMPC) is proposed to simultaneously generate control inputs and system trajectories for an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV). The algorithm combines the benefits of sampling-based motion planning with model predictive control (MPC) while avoiding some of the major pitfalls facing both traditional sampling-based planning algorithms and traditional MPC. The method is based on sampling (i.e., discretizing) the input space at each sample period and implementing a goal-directed optimization (e.g., A*) in place of standard numerical optimization. This formulation of MPC readily applies to nonlinear systems and avoids the local minima which can cause a vehicle to become immobilized behind obstacles. The SBMPC algorithm is applied to an AUV in a cluttered environment and an AUV in a common local minima problem.","doi":"10.1109/OCEANS.2010.5664470","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/OCEANS.2010.5664470","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","displayPublicationTitle":"OCEANS 2010 MTS/IEEE SEATTLE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5651400/5663781/05664470.pdf","publicationTitle":"OCEANS 2010 MTS/IEEE SEATTLE","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5663781","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Motion planning for an autonomous Underwater Vehicle via Sampling Based Model Predictive Control","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 Sept. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Motion planning for an autonomous Underwater Vehicle via Sampling Based Model Predictive Control","conferenceDate":"20-23 Sept. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2010","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5664470/","accessionNumber":"11695702","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5664470/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Motion planning for an autonomous Underwater Vehicle via Sampling Based Model Predictive Control","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"100528033.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045831S","chronDate":"20-23 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5651400","isNumber":"5663781","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5651400","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"5663781","articleId":"5664470","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5664486,"authors":[{"name":"Christophe Laot","affiliation":["Institut TELECOM, TELECOM Bretagne, LaboratoriesTICC CNRS UMR 3192, Universit\u00e9 europ\u00e9enne de Bretagne, Brest, France"],"firstName":"Christophe","lastName":"Laot","id":"37266691400"},{"name":"Nicolas Beuzelin","affiliation":["DGA/GESMA, BCRM Brest, Brest, France"],"firstName":"Nicolas","lastName":"Beuzelin","id":"37563284700"},{"name":"Arnaud Bourr\u00e9","affiliation":["DGA/GESMA, BCRM Brest, Brest, France"],"firstName":"Arnaud","lastName":"Bourr\u00e9","id":"37590099200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4332-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4333-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0197-7385"}],"articleNumber":"5664486","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":253},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5664486","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Experimental results on MMSE turbo equalization in underwater acoustic communication using high order modulation","abstract":"This paper presents some results on MMSE turbo equalization applied to real sea water trials in the Atlantic ocean.

Due to the geometric structure of deep oceans, the channel delay spread between the direct paths and surface/bottom reflections can be on the order of hundreds of milliseconds, which is usually several times larger than the ZP-OFDM block duration, leading to severe inter-block-interference (IBI). Channel time variation also introduces inter-carrier-interference (ICI). The proposed receiver addresses both IBI and ICI in a unified factor-graph representation. Data detection is performed according to the Gaussian message passing (GMP) principle which operates on the factor graph in an iterative manner. The proposed structure is further extended to the progressive/iterative framework, while the channel estimation is updated in each iteration loop. Compared with a multiuser receiver, which views overlapped blocks as coming from different users, the proposed receiver enjoys better block-error-rate performance and appealing expansion capability when multiple receiving-elements are used. Both simulation and experimental results are provided to validate the performance of the proposed receiver.","displayPublicationTitle":"OCEANS 2010 MTS/IEEE SEATTLE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5651400/5663781/05664509.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"10","publicationTitle":"OCEANS 2010 MTS/IEEE SEATTLE","doi":"10.1109/OCEANS.2010.5664509","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/OCEANS.2010.5664509","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5663781","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5664509","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A factor-graph based ZP-OFDM receiver for deep water acoustic channels","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Receivers","Delay","Equalizers","OFDM","Indexes","Decoding","Noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","delays","error statistics","Gaussian processes","graph theory","intercarrier interference","OFDM modulation","receivers","underwater acoustic communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["zero-padded orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","ZP-OFDM receiver","deep water acoustic channels","channel delay spread","surface bottom reflections","inter-block-interference","channel time variation","intercarrier interference","factor-graph representation","Gaussian message passing","channel estimation","block-error-rate","appealing expansion capability"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["OFDM","deep water communications","inter-block-interference","inter-carrier-interference","sparse channel estimation","factor graph","progressive","turbo principle"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5664509/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 Sept. 2010","displayDocTitle":"A factor-graph based ZP-OFDM receiver for deep water acoustic channels","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5664509/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11695460","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2010","conferenceDate":"20-23 Sept. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A factor-graph based ZP-OFDM receiver for deep water acoustic channels","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"100521004.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.101508S","chronDate":"20-23 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5651400","isNumber":"5663781","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5651400","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5663781","articleId":"5664509","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5664515,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The XML-based language has been designed to meet the complex requirements for long-term autonomous operation. It does not require that mission planners be programmers, yet allows them to have a high degree of certainty at deployment that the robot will do what they want it to do. The script is simple to execute on the vehicle, both to minimize CPU power usage and to minimize the chance of failure due to complexity. Users do not need a high-fidelity model of the AUV to plan a mission, as the robot may change in unexpected ways over the course of the mission. Those who wish to do more advanced programming of mission commands and behaviors can do so in the script and are not able to crash the vehicle's operating system. To address these needs, the \u201cTethys script\u201d state-configured layered control language has been developed.","doi":"10.1109/OCEANS.2010.5664515","publicationTitle":"OCEANS 2010 MTS/IEEE SEATTLE","displayPublicationTitle":"OCEANS 2010 MTS/IEEE SEATTLE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5651400/5663781/05664515.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/OCEANS.2010.5664515","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5663781","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Scripting language for state configured layered control of the Tethys long range autonomous underwater vehicle","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5664515","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 Sept. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5664515/","displayDocTitle":"Scripting language for state configured layered control of the Tethys long range autonomous underwater vehicle","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11695464","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5664515/","conferenceDate":"20-23 Sept. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Scripting language for state configured layered control of the Tethys long range autonomous underwater vehicle","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"100527015.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.082691S","chronDate":"20-23 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5651400","isNumber":"5663781","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5651400","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"5663781","articleId":"5664515","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5664570,"authors":[{"name":"Rubaina R.

This paper discusses modifications made to the AUV, in order to make it useful for experiments in this region, which includes shallow water, strong currents, poor visibility, heavy traffic and a poor acoustic environment. These factors strongly influence the choice of navigation method and the system architecture which will enable the AUV to obtain accurate geo-referenced oceanographic properties, and to ensure its safe operation. Our science experiments usually involve sampling at various areas around the coast of Singapore within the same day; this calls for consistent positioning methods that allow ease in deploying and retrieving related equipment. This paper illustrates the use of ultra-short baseline (USBL) tracking system and ranges from an acoustic modem fused by a particle filter to aid the dead reckoning algorithm of the IVER2. The performance of the modified system is shown through simulations and field experiments.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Acoustics","Modems","Sensors","Global Positioning System","Dead reckoning","Sea measurements","Vehicles"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["oceanographic equipment","oceanographic techniques","remotely operated vehicles","underwater sound","underwater vehicles"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["geo-referencing method","oceanographic sampling","marine observation device","Oceanserver IVER2 Autonomous Underwater Vehicle","Singapore coastal zone","shallow water","strong currents","poor visibility","acoustic environment","navigation method","ultra-short baseline tracking system"]}],"doi":"10.1109/OCEANS.2010.5664570","publicationTitle":"OCEANS 2010 MTS/IEEE SEATTLE","displayPublicationTitle":"OCEANS 2010 MTS/IEEE SEATTLE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5651400/5663781/05664570.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5663781","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/OCEANS.2010.5664570","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Accurate geo-referencing method for AUVs for oceanographic sampling","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5664570","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Accurate geo-referencing method for AUVs for oceanographic sampling","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5664570/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5664570/","accessionNumber":"11695537","conferenceDate":"20-23 Sept. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 Sept. 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Accurate geo-referencing method for AUVs for oceanographic sampling","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"100514020.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042568S","chronDate":"20-23 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5651400","isNumber":"5663781","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5651400","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5663781","articleId":"5664570","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-28"},{"_id":5664657,"authors":[{"name":"Salima Ouadfel","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, University of Batna, France"],"firstName":"Salima","lastName":"Ouadfel","id":"37592388200"},{"name":"Mohamed Batouche","affiliation":["COEIA CCIS, King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia"],"firstName":"Mohamed","lastName":"Batouche","id":"37282512600"},{"name":"Abdelmalik Taleb-Ahmed","affiliation":["LAMIH UMR CNRS UVHC, France"],"firstName":"Abdelmalik","lastName":"Taleb-Ahmed","id":"38184973600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7573-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7572-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-7571-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5664657","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":147},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5664657","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Clustering algorithms","Partitioning algorithms","Heuristic algorithms","Pixel","Particle swarm optimization","Particle measurements","Atmospheric measurements"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image segmentation","particle swarm optimisation","pattern clustering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["particle swarm optimization algorithm","dynamic image clustering","mutation operators"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICDIM.2010.5664657","pdfPath":"/iel5/5644872/5662242/05664657.pdf","publicationTitle":"2010 Fifth International Conference on Digital Information Management (ICDIM)","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 Fifth International Conference on Digital Information Management (ICDIM)","startPage":"546","endPage":"551","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5662242","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDIM.2010.5664657","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new particle swarm optimization algorithm for dynamic image clustering","abstract":"In this paper, we present ACPSO a new dynamic image clustering algorithm based on particle swarm optimization.

A kurtosis-based binary hypothesis test is first applied to each pixel to quickly determine the presence of outliers in the local neighborhood.

Aperture-filtered sampling is presented and contrasted with conventional and irregular sampling. Discrete reconstruction from noise-free aperture-filtered samples is investigated and contrasted with conventional continuous reconstruction approaches. The discrete approach enables analytical treatment of the reconstruction grid resolution and the effective resolution imposed by the sampling and reconstruction operations. The noisy case is also explored. A reconstruction estimator based on maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation is proposed to recover the conventional samples from noisy scatterometer measurements. This approach enables the scatterometer noise distribution to be appropriately accounted for in the reconstruction operation. The MAP and conventional reconstruction approaches are applied to the SeaWinds scatterometer and the Advanced Wind Scatterometer, and the effective resolution of the different methods is analyzed. The MAP approach produces results consistent with the well-established scatterometer image reconstruction (SIR) algorithm. The MAP approach significantly enhances the resolution at the expense of increased noise. Although a detailed noise-versus-resolution tradeoff analysis is beyond the scope of this paper, the new framework allows for a more general treatment than the ad hoc tuning parameters of the SIR algorithm.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image reconstruction","Radar measurements","Apertures","Spaceborne radar","Image resolution","Pixel","Noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["atmospheric techniques","filtering theory","geophysical image processing","image reconstruction","maximum likelihood estimation","oceanographic techniques","radar imaging","remote sensing by radar","wind"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discrete noisy aperture filtered sampling inversion","discrete reconstruction","noise free aperture filtered samples","reconstruction grid resolution","effective resolution","reconstruction estimator","maximum a posteriori estimation","MAP estimation","scatterometer noise distribution","SeaWinds scatterometer","Advanced Wind Scatterometer","scatterometer image reconstruction algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Inverse problems","irregular sampling","maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation","scatterometer image reconstruction"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2010.2086063","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel5/36/5753065/05664781.pdf","startPage":"1663","endPage":"1676","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5753065","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2010.2086063","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reconstruction From Aperture-Filtered Samples With Application to Scatterometer Image Reconstruction","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5664781","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Reconstruction From Aperture-Filtered Samples With Application to Scatterometer Image Reconstruction","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5664781/","volume":"49","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5664781/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"11960949","dateOfInsertion":"21 April 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 December 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reconstruction From Aperture-Filtered Samples With Application to Scatterometer Image Reconstruction","sourcePdf":"tgrs-williams-2086063-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.058233S","chronDate":"May  2011","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"5753065","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"5753065","articleId":"5664781","onlineDate":"10 December 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5664782,"authors":[{"name":"Claudio Bianchini","affiliation":["DISMI-University of Modena and Reggio Emilia, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/5747179/5664782/5664782-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Claudio Bianchini was born in Italy on September 9, 1974.

The moving part of the motor is linked to the fixed part by means of linear bearings. As in many other electric machines, bearings represent one of the most vulnerable parts because they are prone to wear and contamination. In the case of linear roller bearings, this issue is even more critical as the rail cannot be easily fully enclosed and protected from environmental contamination, unlike the radial rotating bearing counterpart. This paper presents a diagnostic method based on vibration analysis to identify which signature is related to a specific fault.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fault Detection of Linear Bearings in Brushless AC Linear Motors by Vibration Analysis","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2010.2098354","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/5747179/05664782.pdf","startPage":"1684","endPage":"1694","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2010.2098354","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5747179","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5664782","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5664782/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 December 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2011","displayDocTitle":"Fault Detection of Linear Bearings in Brushless AC Linear Motors by Vibration Analysis","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"58","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/5664782/","dateOfInsertion":"11 April 2011","publicationDate":"May 2011","accessionNumber":"11929566","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fault Detection of Linear Bearings in Brushless AC Linear Motors by Vibration Analysis","sourcePdf":"tie-bellini-2098354-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.086875S","chronDate":"May  2011","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"5747179","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"73","xplore-issue":"5747179","articleId":"5664782","onlineDate":"10 December 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5664783,"authors":[{"name":"Nicholas J.

Then, a controller design procedure that guarantees the DFIG stability under uncertainties and disturbances at the grid side is presented in detail. It is demonstrated that a very fast dynamic behavior can be obtained with the proposed controller, which improves the transient response of the grid-connected DFIG, particularly under conditions of unbalanced voltage dips resulting from asymmetrical network faults. In order to conform with the fault ride-through capability requirements, this paper proposes a new reference strategy, which is divided into normal and fault operation modes. Experimental results are given to support the theoretical analysis and to illustrate the performance of the grid-connected DFIG with the proposed controller.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 December 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5664784/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2011","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"58","issue":"9","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"12 August 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5664784/","accessionNumber":"12205738","displayDocTitle":"Robust Controller for DFIGs of Grid-Connected Wind Turbines","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust Controller for DFIGs of Grid-Connected Wind Turbines","sourcePdf":"tie-dacosta-2098630-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.127916S","chronDate":"Sept.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"5979518","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"134","xplore-issue":"5979518","articleId":"5664784","onlineDate":"10 December 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5664785,"authors":[{"name":"Marco Antonio Rodr\u00edguez-Blanco","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering, Autonomous University of Carmen City, Carmen City, Campeche, M\u00e9xico"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/5747179/5664785/5664785-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Marco Antonio Rodr\u00edguez-Blanco (S'09\u2013M'10) received the B.Sc. degree in electronics engineering from the Technological Institute of Orizaba, Orizaba, Veracruz, M\u00e9xico, in 1997 and the M.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees in electronics engineering from the National Center for Research and Technological Development (cenidet), Cuernavaca, Morelos, Mexico, in 2001 and 2009, respectively.","Since 2001, he has been with the Autonomous University of Carmen City (UNACAR), Carmen City, Campeche, Mexico, as a full-time Professor in the Department of Electronics Engineering.

This technique is applied to a three-phase induction-motor (IM) drive system. The detection technique is adapted to detect failures of short-circuit and open-circuit in the IGBT, which is based on gate-signal monitoring. The most important issue of this technique is the reduction of time for fault detection. This is very important in a failure-tolerant IM drive based on the material-redundancy approach or protection systems since the detection must be done before the device is damaged, in approximately less than 10 \u03bcs. The experimental test and simulations are presented in order to validate the proposed fault-detection technique, and it is validated, achieving replacement of the damaged element in the most suitable time.","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2010.2098355","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/5747179/05664785.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2010.2098355","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5747179","startPage":"1625","endPage":"1633","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Failure-Detection Strategy for IGBT Based on Gate-Voltage Behavior Applied to a Motor Drive System","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5664785","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Failure-Detection Strategy for IGBT Based on Gate-Voltage Behavior Applied to a Motor Drive System","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5664785/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 December 2010","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"58","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 2011","accessionNumber":"11929567","dateOfInsertion":"11 April 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5664785/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Failure-Detection Strategy for IGBT Based on Gate-Voltage Behavior Applied to a Motor Drive System","sourcePdf":"tie-rodriguezblanco-2098355-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.096534S","chronDate":"May  2011","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"5747179","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"162","xplore-issue":"5747179","articleId":"5664785","onlineDate":"10 December 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":5664786,"authors":[{"name":"Lung-Sheng Yang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Far East University, Tainan, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/5979518/5664786/5664786-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Lung-Sheng Yang was born in Tainan, Taiwan, in 1967.

A fundamental trade-off between privacy, measured by the normalized equivocation rate of the biometric measurements, and security, measured by the rate of the key generated from the biometric measurements, is identified. The privacy-security region, which characterizes the above-noted trade-off, is derived for this case. The scenario in which an attacker of the system has side information is then considered. Inner and outer bounds on the privacy-security region are derived in this case.

As an extension of the single Gaussian process regression model, mixtures of Gaussian processes can characterize varying covariances or multimodal data and reduce the deficiency of the computationally cubic complexity of the single Gaussian process model. The infinite mixture of Gaussian processes further integrates a Dirichlet process prior to allowing the number of mixture components to automatically be determined from data. We use variational inference and a truncated stick-breaking representation of the Dirichlet process to approximate the posterior of hidden variables involved in the model. To fix the hyperparameters of the model, the variational EM algorithm and a greedy algorithm are employed.

It addresses the problem of querying and retrieving certain types of music from large music data set. Classification is a fundamental problem in MIR. Many tasks in MIR can be naturally cast in a classification setting, such as genre classification, mood classification, artist recognition, instrument recognition, etc. Music annotation, a new research area in MIR that has attracted much attention in recent years, is also a classification problem in the general sense. Due to the importance of music classification in MIR research, rapid development of new methods, and lack of review papers on recent progress of the field, we provide a comprehensive review on audio-based classification in this paper and systematically summarize the state-of-the-art techniques for music classification. Specifically, we have stressed the difference in the features and the types of classifiers used for different classification tasks. This survey emphasizes on recent development of the techniques and discusses several open issues for future research.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5664796/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 December 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2011","volume":"13","issue":"2","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11874672","dateOfInsertion":"17 March 2011","publicationDate":"April 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5664796/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A Survey of Audio-Based Music Classification and Annotation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Survey of Audio-Based Music Classification and Annotation","sourcePdf":"tmm-fu-2098858-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.273669S","chronDate":"April  2011","xplore-pub-id":"6046","isNumber":"5732768","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6046","citationCount":"208","xplore-issue":"5732768","articleId":"5664796","onlineDate":"10 December 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5664800,"authors":[{"name":"Bocheng Bao","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Information Engineering, Jiangsu Teachers University of Technology, Changzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/5975345/5664800/5664800-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Bocheng Bao received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electronic engineering from the University of Electronics Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China, in 1986 and 1989, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree with the Department of Electronic Engineering, Nanjing University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China, in 2010.","From June 2008 to January 2011, he was a Professor in the School of Electrical and Information Engineering, Jiangsu Teachers University of Technology, Changzhou, China.

To optimize the management of electric sources, generally a proposed solution is the load shedding. To achieve it, the power line communication (PLC) is often used to communicate when it is not possible to add cables. Such technologies use the power line network as a propagation and communication medium. The network quality depends mainly on the power grid topology, but also on the connected household electrical appliances that have a large impact on the PLC systems due to their impedances and noise. In this paper, we propose a new simulation program with integrated circuit emphasis (SPICE) approach for modeling both the electromagnetic (EM) disturbances generated by a printer and the power network. First, the high-frequency power cable characteristics are extracted from S parameter measurements. Then, the model of EM noise generated by a printer is deduced from time-domain measurement and integrated to the SPICE simulator by means of its Laplace transform. Simulation and modeling results of a simple power grid are given in terms of insertion loss evaluation (S\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">21</sub>\n parameter). A validation of the EM noise model is performed by means of a comparison between simulation and measurement results in frequency domain at several points of a simple power network. The present approach allows the prediction of EM interference generated by all household devices at any access points of a power line network without carrying out a systematic measurement.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5664801/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 December 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","publicationDate":"March 2011","accessionNumber":"12004920","htmlLink":"/document/5664801/","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"16 May 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"26","issue":"3","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Modeling of Electromagnetic Interference and PLC Transmission for Loads Shedding in a Microgrid","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modeling of Electromagnetic Interference and PLC Transmission for Loads Shedding in a Microgrid","sourcePdf":"tpel-lebunetel-2097608-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073227S","chronDate":"March  2011","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"5767815","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"5767815","articleId":"5664801","onlineDate":"10 December 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5664804,"authors":[{"name":"Xinbo Ruan","affiliation":["College of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Xinbo","lastName":"Ruan","id":"37272848800"},{"name":"Beibei Wang","affiliation":["Aero-Power Sci-Tech Center, College of Automation Engineering, Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Beibei","lastName":"Wang","id":"37599815900"},{"name":"Kai Yao","affiliation":["Aero-Power Sci-Tech Center, College of Automation Engineering, Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Kai","lastName":"Yao","id":"37402403200"},{"name":"Shu Wang","affiliation":["Aero-Power Sci-Tech Center, College of Automation Engineering, Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Shu","lastName":"Wang","id":"37599734400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0885-8993"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0107"}],"articleNumber":"5664804","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":80,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":2092},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Power Electronics Society","url":"http://www.ieee-pels.org/"}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimum Injected Current Harmonics to Minimize Peak-to-Average Ratio of LED Current for Electrolytic Capacitor-Less AC\u2013DC Drivers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5664804","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Light emitting diodes","Harmonic analysis","Peak to average power ratio","Capacitors","Power harmonic filters","Driver circuits","Turning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["AC-DC power convertors","driver circuits","light emitting diodes","power factor correction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimum injected current harmonics","peak-to-average ratio","LED current","electrolytic capacitor-less AC-DC drivers","LED driver","input power factor","voltage 25 V","current 0.35 A"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Flyback converter","harmonic current injection","light-emitting diode (LED)","peak-to-average ratio","power factor correction (PFC)"]}],"abstract":"The lifetime of an ac-dc LED driver can be increased by eliminating the electrolytic capacitor.

Two schemes are proposed and tested in a typical 240-V/75-kVA Canadian suburban distribution feeder with 12 houses with roof-top PV systems. In the first scheme, all PV inverters have the same droop coefficients. In the second, the droop coefficients are different so as to share the total active power curtailed among all PV inverters/houses. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed schemes and that the option of sharing the power curtailment among all customers comes at the cost of an overall higher amount of power curtailed.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Coordinated Active Power Curtailment of Grid Connected PV Inverters for Overvoltage Prevention","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Sustainable Energy","doi":"10.1109/TSTE.2010.2098483","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Sustainable Energy","pdfPath":"/iel5/5165391/5735622/05664808.pdf","startPage":"139","endPage":"147","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSTE.2010.2098483","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5735622","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5664808","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5664808/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 December 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2011","displayDocTitle":"Coordinated Active Power Curtailment of Grid Connected PV Inverters for Overvoltage Prevention","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"2","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/5664808/","dateOfInsertion":"22 March 2011","publicationDate":"April 2011","accessionNumber":"11874960","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Coordinated Active Power Curtailment of Grid Connected PV Inverters for Overvoltage Prevention","sourcePdf":"tste-tonkoski-2098483-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.106606S","chronDate":"April  2011","xplore-pub-id":"5165391","isNumber":"5735622","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5165391","citationCount":"500","xplore-issue":"5735622","articleId":"5664808","onlineDate":"10 December 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-28"},{"_id":5664812,"authors":[{"name":"Mauro Di Marco","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Ingegneria dell'Informazione, Universit\u00e1 di Siena, Siena, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/5756263/5664812/5664812-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Mauro Di Marco was born in Firenze, Italy, in 1970.

First, the first step linearization of the kinematics determines the pseudo (or auxiliary) surge velocity and yaw angle, which are used as the commands for the second-step linearization. Then, in the second-step linearization of dynamics, the actual torque inputs are designed to make the actual surge velocity and yaw angle follow these pseudo commands to achieve the position and yaw angle tracking. By employing the dynamic surface control method in the design of each kinematic and dynamic linearization law, we can obtain a control structure that is much simpler than the previous backstepping-based controllers such that it is beneficial from the practical application viewpoint. In addition, it is possible to track general reference trajectories, i.e., the reference yaw velocity need not be persistently exciting and there is no restriction on the initial yaw tracking error. In particular, global tracking control is achieved even in the presence of input and velocity constraints, unlike the DSC method which introduces the several filters in the backstepping design procedure to avoid the model differentiation and make it easier to be implemented and usually has semiglobal tracking performance. Finally, the stability analysis and numerical simulations are performed to confirm the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Global Tracking Control of Underactuated Ships With Input and Velocity Constraints Using Dynamic Surface Control Method","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology","doi":"10.1109/TCST.2010.2090526","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/87/6018336/05664813.pdf","startPage":"1357","endPage":"1370","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCST.2010.2090526","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6018336","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5664813","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5664813/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 December 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2011","displayDocTitle":"Global Tracking Control of Underactuated Ships With Input and Velocity Constraints Using Dynamic Surface Control Method","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"19","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/5664813/","dateOfInsertion":"15 September 2011","publicationDate":"Nov. 2011","accessionNumber":"12228666","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Global Tracking Control of Underactuated Ships With Input and Velocity Constraints Using Dynamic Surface Control Method","sourcePdf":"tcst-chwa-2090526-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.084746S","chronDate":"Nov.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"87","isNumber":"6018336","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"87","citationCount":"132","xplore-issue":"6018336","articleId":"5664813","onlineDate":"10 December 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5664815,"authors":[{"name":"Eric Sortomme","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5165411/5715606/5664815/5664815-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Eric Sortomme (S'08) was born in Ephrata, WA, on September 22, 1981.

The application of the algorithms to two test systems verifies these relationships approximately hold independent of system topology. They also show the additional benefits of reduced computation time and problem convexity when using load factor or load variance as the objective function rather than system losses. This is important for real-time dispatching of PHEVs.","doi":"10.1109/TSG.2010.2090913","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid","pdfPath":"/iel5/5165411/5715606/05664815.pdf","startPage":"198","endPage":"205","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5715606","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSG.2010.2090913","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Coordinated Charging of Plug-In Hybrid Electric Vehicles to Minimize Distribution System Losses","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5664815","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2011","displayDocTitle":"Coordinated Charging of Plug-In Hybrid Electric Vehicles to Minimize Distribution System Losses","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5664815/","publicationDate":"March 2011","dateOfInsertion":"17 February 2011","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"11832549","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5664815/","volume":"2","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 December 2010","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Coordinated Charging of Plug-In Hybrid Electric Vehicles to Minimize Distribution System Losses","sourcePdf":"tsg-sortomme-2090913-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.102349S","chronDate":"March  2011","xplore-pub-id":"5165411","isNumber":"5715606","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5165411","citationCount":"751","xplore-issue":"5715606","articleId":"5664815","onlineDate":"10 December 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":5664816,"authors":[{"name":"Jiaxin Ning","affiliation":["EnerNex Corporation, Knoxville, TN, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Jiaxin Ning (S'08\u2013M'10) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electrical engineering from Chongqing University, China, in 2004 and 2007, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from Tennessee Technological University, Cookeville, in 2010.","He is currently a Senior Consultant on electric power research, engineering, and consulting at EnerNex Corporation, Knoxville, TN.

Selection of the Order 2 Daubechies wavelet and scale 5 as the best wavelet function and the optimal decomposition scale, respectively, for disturbance signals is demonstrated according to the criterion of the maximum wavelet energy of wavelet coefficients (WCs). To justify the proposed method, phasor data are simulated under disturbance circumstances in the IEEE New England 39-bus system. The results indicate that WT-based MRA can not only compress disturbance signals but also depress the sinusoidal and white noise contained in the signals.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid","pdfPath":"/iel5/5165411/5715606/05664816.pdf","startPage":"212","endPage":"218","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid","doi":"10.1109/TSG.2010.2091291","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSG.2010.2091291","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5715606","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5664816","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Wavelet-Based Data Compression Technique for Smart Grid","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiresolution analysis","Noise","Data compression","Noise reduction","Power system dynamics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data compression","smart power grids","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wavelet-based data compression approach","smart grid","wavelet transform","multiresolution analysis","denoising capabilities","power system signals","order 2 Daubechies wavelet","optimal decomposition scale","disturbance signals","maximum wavelet energy","phasor data","IEEE New England 39-bus system","sinusoidal noise depression","white noise depression"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Data compression","disturbance analysis","wavelet transform"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5664816/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 December 2010","displayDocTitle":"A Wavelet-Based Data Compression Technique for Smart Grid","volume":"2","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/5664816/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2011","accessionNumber":"11832550","dateOfInsertion":"17 February 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Wavelet-Based Data Compression Technique for Smart Grid","sourcePdf":"tsg-wang-2091291-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.116647S","chronDate":"March  2011","xplore-pub-id":"5165411","isNumber":"5715606","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5165411","citationCount":"104","xplore-issue":"5715606","articleId":"5664816","onlineDate":"10 December 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-22"},{"_id":5664817,"authors":[{"name":"Zheng Li","affiliation":["University of Colorado Boulder, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/92/6099858/5664817/5664817-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Zheng Li (S'07) received the B.S. degree in electronic technology and science from Tsinghua University, Beijing, China,in 2005, and is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree from the Institute of Microelectronics, Tsinghua University.","He performed the work described in this article while working as a visiting student at the University of Colorado at Boulder.

Recent advances in nanophotonic fabrication have made on-chip optics an attractive alternative. However, system integration challenges remain. In particular, the parameters of on-chip nanophotonic structures are sensitive to fabrication-induced process variation and run-time spatial thermal variation across the die. This work addresses the performance and reliability challenges that arise from this sensitivity to variation. The paper first presents a model predicting the system-level effects of thermal and process variation in nanophotonic networks.

Besides its applications in image compression and signal processing in the past few years, compressed sensing has been attracting ever-increasing interests in the areas of wireless communication and sensor networks. According to its advantageous characteristics, compressed sensing is able to play a significant role in the fields like wireless channel estimation, signal detection, data gathering, network monitoring, and so on. This study describes current researches on the applications of CS in wireless communication and sensor networks, and then specially focuses on bringing out a novel random routing scheme for efficient data gathering. Accordingly, we first introduce the basic approach of compressed sensing, and then summarize recent technical advancements of compressed sensing schemes and their applications in wireless communication and sensor networks. Then, we propose a random routing method executed with CS for efficient data gathering in typical wireless sensor networking environment, and analyze the relevant performances comparing with those of the existing data gathering schemes, obtaining the conclusion that the proposed scheme is effective in signal reconstruction and efficient in reducing routing energy consumption.","doi":"10.1109/ISCIT.2010.5664840","publicationTitle":"2010 10th International Symposium on Communications and Information Technologies","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 10th International Symposium on Communications and Information Technologies","pdfPath":"/iel5/5647048/5664831/05664840.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCIT.2010.5664840","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5664831","startPage":"220","endPage":"225","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Compressed sensing based random routing for multi-hop wireless sensor networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5664840","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Compressed sensing based random routing for multi-hop wireless sensor networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 Oct. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5664840/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"26-29 Oct. 2010","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11695223","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5664840/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Compressed sensing based random routing for multi-hop wireless sensor networks","confLoc":"Tokyo, Japan","sourcePdf":"2WA144.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057444S","chronDate":"26-29 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5647048","isNumber":"5664831","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5647048","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5664831","articleId":"5664840","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5664842,"authors":[{"name":"Wen-Ching Chung","affiliation":["National Chiao Tung University, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Wen-Ching","lastName":"Chung","id":"37292716100"},{"name":"Chung-Ju Chang","affiliation":["National Chiao Tung University, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chung-Ju","lastName":"Chang","id":"37276906400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7010-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7007-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7009-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5664842","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":92},"abstract":"In this paper, we propose a fuzzy logics based scheduling (FLBS) scheme for downlink orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA)/space division multiple access (SDMA) systems with multimedia traffic. The challenge in the scheduling problem of OFDMA/SDMA systems with multimedia traffic is how to effectively utilize the scarce radio resource as well as maximize the system throughput and guarantee the quality of services (QoS) and fairness. Traditionally, the user information and the channel information are used to assist the scheduler to allocate the radio resource. However, these two information can not be simultaneously modeled on a mathematical function to provide a clear scheduling policy. By using fuzzy logics, the proposed FLBS scheme assigns an urgency value to user based on the user information and the channel information. According to the assigned urgency value, each user gets a suitable radio resource region to maximize the system throughput while guarantee QoS requirement and fairness. Simulation results show that, compared to the most recently proposed algorithms, the proposed scheduling algorithm can improve the packet drop ratio by more than 63 % and the fairness performance by more than 75 % when the traffic load is greater than 0.5.","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 10th International Symposium on Communications and Information

propose a simple method for the generation of signature matrices for a space-time spreading (STS) system with BPSK modulation, where a signature sequence assigned to a user is paritioned into segements and the segments are assigned to the transmit antennas of the user. We show that, if the signature sequences are linearly independent, the STS system does not has an error floor in its BER performance and, of course, achieve the full receive antenna diversity. For the signature matrices generated from the M-sequences or Gold sequences, the BER performance of the system with likelihood ascent search detectors is superior to the V-BLAST system with the maximum-likelihood (ML) detectors. Moreover, for a large processing gain, the BER performance of the proposed system approaches the least upper bound derived previously.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5664831","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCIT.2010.5664868","publicationTitle":"2010 10th International Symposium on Communications and Information Technologies","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 10th International Symposium on Communications and Information Technologies","pdfPath":"/iel5/5647048/5664831/05664868.pdf","startPage":"372","endPage":"377","doi":"10.1109/ISCIT.2010.5664868","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spreading matrices from PN sequences","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 Oct. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Spreading matrices from PN sequences","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"26-29 Oct. 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5664868/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11695268","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5664868/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spreading matrices from PN sequences","confLoc":"Tokyo, Japan","sourcePdf":"2WA252.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054465S","chronDate":"26-29 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5647048","isNumber":"5664831","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5647048","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5664831","articleId":"5664868","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5664869,"authors":[{"name":"Norharyati Binti Harum","affiliation":["School Science and Technology, Keio University, Yokohama, Kanagawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Norharyati Binti","lastName":"Harum","id":"37589641700"},{"name":"Tomoaki Ohtsuki","affiliation":["School Science and Technology, Keio University, Yokohama, Kanagawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Tomoaki","lastName":"Ohtsuki","id":"37268988400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7010-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7007-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7009-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5664869","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":62},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Gain","Peak to average power ratio","Transmitters","Bit error rate","Receivers","Joints"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","code division multiple access","error statistics","intersymbol interference","time division multiple access","transient response"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["PARR reduction","joint transmission technique","joint detection technique","intersymbol interference","multiple access interference","time-division synchronous code-division-multiple-access","TD-SCDMA","channel estimation","channel impulse responses","bit error rate"]}],"abstract":"Joint Detection (JD) technique is used to reduce intersymbol interference (ISI) and multiple access interference (MAI) in current downlink (DL) of Time-Division Synchronous Code-Division-Multiple-Access (TD-SCDMA). However, the technique requires significant calculation and channel estimator in mobile station (MS), causing complexity in MS. Using TDD features where received uplink channel impulse responses (CIRs) can be used in DL, Joint Transmission (JT) has been proposed. In JT, all of JD functions are removed into BS, thus a simple and low cost MS can be realized. However, studies of JT show that the JT increases transmission power. This may affect Peak to Average Power Ratio (PARR) of the system. For a single path case, our result shows that JT increases overall transmitted power as well as average transmitted power, leading to lower PARR. However, as JT multiplies CIRs with spreading codes before transmission, high PARR might be occurred in multipath case. To avoid high PARR, we propose a new approach of JT technique that can perform lower PARR even in multipath case. The proposed technique selects certain paths instead of all paths used in JT processing so that PARR becomes lower, while keeping good bid error rate (BER) performance.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"PARR reduction of TD-SCDMA with Joint Transmission technique","publicationTitle":"2010 10th International Symposium on Communications and Information Technologies","doi":"10.1109/ISCIT.2010.5664869","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 10th International Symposium on Communications and Information Technologies","pdfPath":"/iel5/5647048/5664831/05664869.pdf","startPage":"366","endPage":"371","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCIT.2010.5664869","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5664831","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5664869","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5664869/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 Oct. 2010","displayDocTitle":"PARR reduction of TD-SCDMA with Joint Transmission technique","conferenceDate":"26-29 Oct. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5664869/","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2010","publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11695272","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"PARR reduction of TD-SCDMA with Joint Transmission technique","confLoc":"Tokyo, Japan","sourcePdf":"2WA251.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059975S","chronDate":"26-29 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5647048","isNumber":"5664831","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5647048","xplore-issue":"5664831","articleId":"5664869","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5664871,"authors":[{"name":"Agus Susilo","affiliation":["Graduate School of Electrical and Information Engineering, Polytechnic University, Japan"],"firstName":"Agus","lastName":"Susilo","id":"37590065500"},{"name":"Tomoko K.

The multiple-wavelength optical orthogonal code (MWOOC), which is one of the 2-D codes proposed by Kwong et al. in 2005, uses two kinds of codes. One is an optical orthogonal code (OOC) as a time-spreading code, and the other is a modified prime sequence (MPS) code as a wavelength-hopping code. The MWOOCs have some advantages compared with other 2-D codes especially in high bit-rate OCDMA systems. The only drawback of the MWOOC is that the code weight is no greater than the smallest prime of the number of wavelengths when the number of wavelengths is not prime. Since the code weight is equal to the peak value of the auto-correlation function, it degrades bit error rate (BER) performance of the system. Moreover, a nonprime integer makes the total code cardinality small, and thus the maximum number of subscribers in a nonprime case is much smaller than that in a prime case. Meanwhile, a generalized class of MPS codes, which includes the class of original MPS codes as its subclass, was presented recently by the authors. The important property of the generalized MPS codes is that the codes can be constructed over not only prime fields but also extension fields, i.e. GF(p\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">m</sup>\n) where p is a prime number and m is a positive integer. It has been shown that the correlation property of the generalized MPS codes is the same as that of the original MPS codes. The use of the generalized MPS codes solve the problem of the MWOOC. That is, nonprime numbers can be also taken as the number of wavelengths without degrading BER performance or reducing code cardinality. This paper investigates properties and BER performance of the MWOOCs employing the generalized MPS codes.","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 10th International Symposium on Communications and Information Technologies","pdfPath":"/iel5/5647048/5664831/05664871.pdf","startPage":"378","endPage":"383","publicationTitle":"2010 10th International Symposium on Communications and Information Technologies","doi":"10.1109/ISCIT.2010.5664871","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCIT.2010.5664871","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5664831","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5664871","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Two-dimensional optical CDMA systems based on MWOOC with generalized MPS codes","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bit error rate","Adaptive optics","Correlation","Multiaccess communication","Binary codes","Optical pulses","Approximation methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","code division multiplexing","correlation methods","error statistics","Galois fields","optical communication","orthogonal codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["two-dimensional optical CDMA systems","MWOOC","generalized MPS codes","2D codes","optical code-division multiple access systems","O-CDMA systems","one-dimensional time-spreading codes","multiple-wavelength optical orthogonal code","modified prime sequence code","wavelength-hopping code","high bit-rate OCDMA systems","code weight","auto-correlation function","bit error rate performance","BER performance","nonprime integer","code cardinality","extension fields","GF(pm)","positive integer","correlation property","nonprime numbers"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5664871/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 Oct. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Two-dimensional optical CDMA systems based on MWOOC with generalized MPS codes","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5664871/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11695286","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2010","conferenceDate":"26-29 Oct. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Two-dimensional optical CDMA systems based on MWOOC with generalized MPS codes","confLoc":"Tokyo, Japan","sourcePdf":"2WA253.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.0935S","chronDate":"26-29 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5647048","isNumber":"5664831","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5647048","xplore-issue":"5664831","articleId":"5664871","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5664884,"authors":[{"name":"Toru Sakaguchi","affiliation":["Department of Information and Computer Science, Keio University, Yokohama, Kanagawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Toru","lastName":"Sakaguchi","id":"37587602000"},{"name":"Tomoaki Ohtsuki","affiliation":["Department of Information and Computer Science, Keio University, Yokohama, Kanagawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Tomoaki","lastName":"Ohtsuki","id":"37268988400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7010-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7007-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7009-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5664884","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":244},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5664884","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cognitive radio","Simulation","Detectors","Shadow mapping","Performance evaluation","Noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","radio spectrum management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cooperative spectrum sensing techniques","decision comparison","cognitive radio systems","malicious nodes","energy detection","malfunctioning sensing devices","sensing data"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ISCIT.2010.5664884","publicationTitle":"2010 10th International Symposium on Communications and Information Technologies","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 10th International Symposium on Communications and Information Technologies","pdfPath":"/iel5/5647048/5664831/05664884.pdf","startPage":"464","endPage":"469","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCIT.2010.5664884","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5664831","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cooperative spectrum sensing techniques using decision comparison for cognitive radio systems including malicious nodes","abstract":"We consider cooperative spectrum sensing based on energy detection.

Such a frequency planning strategy can lead to unacceptable inter-cell interference levels experienced especially by users located at the cell edge area. Soft frequency reuse (SFR) is considered as an effective frequency reuse scheme for inter-cell interference coordination as well as maintaining spectrum efficiency. In this paper, we investigate the performance of SFR for LTE downlink transmission by considering issues of various traffic loads and different power ratio configurations. In addition to the cell-edge user performance, the overall cell performance and the cell-center user performance are both evaluated in terms of throughput estimation. Using simulation studies, the advantages and limitations of SFR are comprehensively examined and compared against the classical frequency reuse of one scheme.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5665044/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 Oct. 2010","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"26-29 Oct. 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5665044/","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2010","publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11695111","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Performance analysis of soft frequency reuse for inter-cell interference coordination in LTE networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance analysis of soft frequency reuse for inter-cell interference coordination in LTE networks","confLoc":"Tokyo, Japan","sourcePdf":"3ThM151.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038769S","chronDate":"26-29 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5647048","isNumber":"5664831","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5647048","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"5664831","articleId":"5665044","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5665045,"authors":[{"name":"Chiwaran Niljhan","affiliation":["Department of Teacher Training in Electrical Engineering, King Mongkut's University of Technology North Bangkok, Bangkok, Thailand"],"firstName":"Chiwaran","lastName":"Niljhan","id":"37597717000"},{"name":"Chaiyod Pirak","affiliation":["Department of Teacher Training in Electrical Engineering, King Mongkut's University of Technology North Bangkok, Bangkok, Thailand"],"firstName":"Chaiyod","lastName":"Pirak","id":"37297324900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7010-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7007-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7009-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5665045","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":143},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5665045","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","Frequency estimation","Relays","Protocols","Joints","Estimation","OFDM"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","cooperative communication","decode and forward communication","frequency estimation","protocols","radiocommunication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","cooperative wireless communication","adaptive relay-selection protocol","frequency offset estimation","decode-and-forward protocol","fixed relay selection","high-SNR regime","source node","relay node"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, an adaptive relay-selection protocol with joint channel and frequency offset estimation for cooperative wireless communication systems is investigated.

N samples generated by the N-point inverse discrete Fourier transform at the OFDM transmitter form one transmission block. It is controlled so that the M tail samples of every N-point transmission block have the same pilot sequence. If the maximum delay spread of multipath channel does not exceed M-sample duration, such an operation creates a circular channel under the multipath conditions. If the maximum delay spread exceeds M-sample duration, an overlap frequency domain equalization (FDE) is applied to the discrete Fourier transform input at the OFDM receiver. The overlap FDE is a technique for single-carrier transmission without using cyclic prefix to cope with the multipath channel.

The Matching Pursuit (MP) algorithm with implicit denoising operation is used as the signal reconstruction method of CS for pulse UWB.

The baseband unit supports 2\u00d72 MIMO-OFDM with an 80-MHz channel and provides the maximum data rate of 600 Mbps. The wider channel of 80 MHz is a candidate technology for the next WLAN standardization of IEEE802.11ac. OFDM tends to cause high peak PAPR for the wider channel and distort power amplifier performance in RF. We evaluated non-linear distortion and BER by baseband-RF simulation and measurement to optimize OFDM preambles. The RF unit operating at 5.2-GHz band is based on super heterodyne architecture. The developed transceiver is used for field experiments in outdoor wireless communications.","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 10th International Symposium on Communications and Information Technologies","pdfPath":"/iel5/5647048/5664831/05665113.pdf","startPage":"891","endPage":"894","publicationTitle":"2010 10th International Symposium on Communications and Information Technologies","doi":"10.1109/ISCIT.2010.5665113","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCIT.2010.5665113","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5664831","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5665113","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Development of 600 Mbps 2\u00d72 MIMO-OFDM baseband and RF transceiver at 5 GHz band","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Transceivers","Radio frequency","Baseband","MIMO","Peak to average power ratio","Field programmable gate arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["IEEE standards","MIMO communication","OFDM modulation","radio transceivers","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO-OFDM baseband","RF transceiver","wireless LAN system","WLAN standardization","IEEE 802.11ac","power amplifier performance","nonlinear distortion","super heterodyne architecture","outdoor wireless communication","frequency 5.2 GHz","frequency 80 MHz"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5665113/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 Oct. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Development of 600 Mbps 2\u00d72 MIMO-OFDM baseband and RF transceiver at 5 GHz band","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5665113/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11695181","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2010","conferenceDate":"26-29 Oct. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Development of 600 Mbps 2\u00d72 MIMO-OFDM baseband and RF transceiver at 5 GHz band","confLoc":"Tokyo, Japan","sourcePdf":"5FM141.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.149513S","chronDate":"26-29 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5647048","isNumber":"5664831","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5647048","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5664831","articleId":"5665113","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5665115,"authors":[{"name":"Aurupong Yiwleak","affiliation":["Thai-German Graduate School of Engineering (TGGS), King Mongkut's University of Technology, North Bangkok, Thailand"],"firstName":"Aurupong","lastName":"Yiwleak","id":"37973151200"},{"name":"Chaiyod Pirak","affiliation":["Thai-German Graduate School of Engineering (TGGS), King Mongkut's University of Technology, North Bangkok, Thailand"],"firstName":"Chaiyod","lastName":"Pirak","id":"37297324900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7010-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7007-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7009-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5665115","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":252},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Bit error rate","MIMO","Receivers","Frequency domain analysis","Frequency division multiplexing","Fading"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["AWGN channels","codes","intercarrier interference","interference suppression","MIMO communication","OFDM modulation","Rayleigh channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["intercarrier interference cancellation","MIMO-OFDM system","zero-padded conjugate cancellation technique","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing system","intercarrier interference mitigation","frequency offset","Alamouti-coded MIMO system","backward compatibility","receiver complexity","bit error rate","AWGN channel","Rayleigh fading channel"]}],"abstract":"This paper proposes a zero-padded conjugate cancellation technique in orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems by padding zero between two consecutive symbols in order to effectively mitigate intercarrier interference (ICI) caused by a frequency offset in MIMO systems.

This is due to stretches of overlapping wires that produce parasitic coupling between adjacent signal lines. In VLSI design, crosstalk creates a lot of problems. Crosstalk minimization problem is NP complete. The research is to find the solution with minimum crosstalk by using signal transition avoidance technique. We use simulated annealing algorithm to search for the optimal layout pattern. Different generation sequence of a graph give diverse alternatives for horizontal constraint graph of a VLSI channel. The energy function can be designed to take care of crosstalk in the channel. The optimization result, gives the routing solution with minimum crosstalk and minimal total energy. We reduce total energy through capacitance by rearranging wire signal transition. The crosstalk noise model is a proposed concept of effective signal transition consideration. The proposed technique is developed based on a decreasing coupling technique exhibiting a total energy of 6.9 as compared to average energy of all possible patterns. In addition, the result of optimal pattern is 24.4% less than cost of the original layout pattern.","doi":"10.1109/ISCIT.2010.5665117","publicationTitle":"2010 10th International Symposium on Communications and Information Technologies","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 10th International Symposium on Communications and Information Technologies","pdfPath":"/iel5/5647048/5664831/05665117.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCIT.2010.5665117","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5664831","startPage":"911","endPage":"915","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Crosstalk minimization in VLSI design using signal transition avoidance","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5665117","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Crosstalk minimization in VLSI design using signal transition avoidance","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 Oct. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5665117/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"26-29 Oct. 2010","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11695185","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5665117/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Crosstalk minimization in VLSI design using signal transition avoidance","confLoc":"Tokyo, Japan","sourcePdf":"5FM151.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056443S","chronDate":"26-29 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5647048","isNumber":"5664831","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5647048","xplore-issue":"5664831","articleId":"5665117","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5665118,"authors":[{"name":"Hailu Song","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory on ISN, School of Telecommunications Engineering, Xidian University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China"],"firstName":"Hailu","lastName":"Song","id":"37589008600"},{"name":"Qinghai Yang","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory on ISN, School of Telecommunications Engineering, Xidian University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China"],"firstName":"Qinghai","lastName":"Yang","id":"37288952900"},{"name":"Kyung Sup Kwak","affiliation":["Graduate School of Information Technology and Telecommunications, Inha University, Incheon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Kyung Sup","lastName":"Kwak","id":"37280638100"},{"name":"Fenglin Fu","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory on ISN, School of Telecommunications Engineering, Xidian University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China"],"firstName":"Fenglin","lastName":"Fu","id":"37411388800"},{"name":"Peiwen Zhu","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory on ISN, School of Telecommunications Engineering, Xidian University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China"],"firstName":"Peiwen","lastName":"Zhu","id":"37595510200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7010-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7007-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7009-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5665118","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":169},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5665118","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Array signal processing","Signal to noise ratio","Base stations","Interference channels","Correlation","Transmitters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","feedback","interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multicell MISO interference channel","limited feedback","cooperative multicell transmit strategy","channel state information","base station","limited-feedback scenario","multicell joint beamforming"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ISCIT.2010.5665118","publicationTitle":"2010 10th International Symposium on Communications and Information Technologies","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 10th International Symposium on Communications and Information Technologies","pdfPath":"/iel5/5647048/5664831/05665118.pdf","startPage":"907","endPage":"910","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCIT.2010.5665118","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5664831","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint beamforming for multi-cell MISO interference channel with limited feedback","abstract":"Cooperative multi-cell transmit strategies typically require full channel state information (CSI) at the base station.

Several previous researches employed dictionary as the main resource for consideration. However there still exist two problems including ambiguous words and unknown words. These unknown words can be categorized into two groups, -i.e., newly defined words and named entities. This paper presents an approach for improving the performance of Thai word segmentation by merging Named Entity Recognition (NER) to the Thai word segmentation. The Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) algorithm is applied for training and recognizing Thai named entities. The prefixes and suffixes of Thai named entities are selected as main features for learning the models. The performance evaluations are experimented by using the Thai standard word segmentation corpus, namely BEST2009, which consists of 5 million words. Various word-level grams (i.e., three, five and seven) are also employed to construct the Thai NER models. The experimental results show that the 7-gram NER model provides the best performance. Merging the proposed NER model to the Thai word segmentation called TLex (Thai Lexeme Analyzer) can improve the performance measured by F1-measure from 92.39% to 93.96%.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improving Thai word segmentation with Named Entity Recognition","publicationTitle":"2010 10th International Symposium on Communications and Information Technologies","doi":"10.1109/ISCIT.2010.5665124","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 10th International Symposium on Communications and Information Technologies","pdfPath":"/iel5/5647048/5664831/05665124.pdf","startPage":"940","endPage":"945","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCIT.2010.5665124","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5664831","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5665124","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5665124/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 Oct. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Improving Thai word segmentation with Named Entity Recognition","conferenceDate":"26-29 Oct. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5665124/","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2010","publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11695192","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improving Thai word segmentation with Named Entity Recognition","confLoc":"Tokyo, Japan","sourcePdf":"5FM162.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050557S","chronDate":"26-29 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5647048","isNumber":"5664831","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5647048","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"5664831","articleId":"5665124","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5665125,"authors":[{"name":"Hiroki Harada","affiliation":["Research Laboratories, NTT DOCOMO, Inc., Japan"],"firstName":"Hiroki","lastName":"Harada","id":"37402500600"},{"name":"Hiromasa Fujii","affiliation":["Research Laboratories, NTT DOCOMO, Inc., Japan"],"firstName":"Hiromasa","lastName":"Fujii","id":"37403783300"},{"name":"Shunji Miura","affiliation":["Research Laboratories, NTT DOCOMO, Inc., Japan"],"firstName":"Shunji","lastName":"Miura","id":"37392727600"},{"name":"Tomoyuki Ohya","affiliation":["Research Laboratories, NTT DOCOMO, Inc., Japan"],"firstName":"Tomoyuki","lastName":"Ohya","id":"37391823100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7010-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7007-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7009-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5665125","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":87},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Receivers","Fading","Frequency control","Converters","Time frequency analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","OFDM modulation","radio receivers","radio spectrum management","radio transmitters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cyclostationarity-inducing transmission","OFDM-based spectrum sharing system","spectrum-shared environment","cyclic autocorrelation function","transmitter","cognitive receiver","spectrum sharing environment coordinating","overhead reduction method","flexible peak induction method","cycle frequency domain","lag parameter domain","signal identification performance","computer simulation"]}],"abstract":"This paper introduces cyclostationarity-inducing transmission methods for identifying OFDM-based signals in spectrum-shared environments. Specifically, the OFDM signal is configured before transmission such that its cyclic autocorrelation function (CAF) has certain peaks at preselected cycle frequencies and time lags. By choosing specific peak patterns for each transmitter, the cognitive receivers can obtain the necessary information for coordinating spectrum sharing environments. We investigate several improvements to cyclostationarity-inducing transmission such as an overhead reduction method and flexible peak induction method. The newly-proposed flexible peak induction method extends the position of the CAF peaks into not only the cycle frequency domain but also the lag parameter domain. The signal identification performance is evaluated based on computer simulation and testbed experiments.","doi":"10.1109/ISCIT.2010.5665125","publicationTitle":"2010 10th International Symposium on Communications and Information Technologies","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 10th International Symposium on Communications and Information Technologies","pdfPath":"/iel5/5647048/5664831/05665125.pdf","startPage":"956","endPage":"961","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCIT.2010.5665125","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5664831","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cyclostationarity-inducing transmission for OFDM-based spectrum sharing systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5665125","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 Oct. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5665125/","displayDocTitle":"Cyclostationarity-inducing transmission for OFDM-based spectrum sharing systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11695193","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5665125/","conferenceDate":"26-29 Oct. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cyclostationarity-inducing transmission for OFDM-based spectrum sharing systems","confLoc":"Tokyo, Japan","sourcePdf":"6FA111.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070868S","chronDate":"26-29 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5647048","isNumber":"5664831","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5647048","xplore-issue":"5664831","articleId":"5665125","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5665129,"authors":[{"name":"Hidekazu Murata","affiliation":["Kyoto University, Japan"],"firstName":"Hidekazu","lastName":"Murata","id":"37274683700"},{"name":"Takuto Ohno","affiliation":["Kyoto University, Japan"],"firstName":"Takuto","lastName":"Ohno","id":"37401173400"},{"name":"Koji Yamamoto","affiliation":["Kyoto University, Japan"],"firstName":"Koji","lastName":"Yamamoto","id":"37278473200"},{"name":"Susumu Yoshida","affiliation":["Kyoto University, Japan"],"firstName":"Susumu","lastName":"Yoshida","id":"37270905100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7010-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7007-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7009-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5665129","dbTime":"17 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":173},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Feature extraction","Cognitive radio","Detectors","Binary phase shift keying","Correlation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","interference","radio spectrum management","signal classification","signal detection","telecommunication network reliability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio system","cooperative spectrum sensing","detection reliability","wireless system","frequency spectrum sharing","interference avoidance","communication reliability","cyclostationary detection","cyclic-feature-based method","distributed signal detection","signal classification"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5665129","doi":"10.1109/ISCIT.2010.5665129","publicationTitle":"2010 10th International Symposium on Communications and Information Technologies","abstract":"In cognitive radios, reliable detection of wireless systems is crucial since these radios share the frequency spectrum with other wireless systems. At the same time, it is necessary to avoid interference with the primary systems. In a heterogeneous environment, however, systems with different priorities have different protection requirements and operating parameters. The cognitive radio must guarantee highly reliable communication in the primary systems, but need not necessarily guarantee reliable communication in the secondary systems. Therefore, classification of the signals in a cognitive radio is necessary to fulfill the above mentioned protection requirements. Cyclostationary detection allows for the classification of coexisting cyclostationary signals with different parameters, whereas energy detection cannot be used for distinguishing primary signals from secondary signals. This method has been theoretically investigated, but it has not been applied to an actual field. This paper presents the experimental results obtained from field trials on the use of cyclic-feature-based methods for distributed signal detection and signal classification.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCIT.2010.5665129","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5664831","startPage":"980","endPage":"984","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 10th International Symposium on Communications and Information Technologies","pdfPath":"/iel5/5647048/5664831/05665129.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Implementation and field experiments of cognitive radio system with cooperative spectrum sensing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5665129/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 Oct. 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5665129/","displayDocTitle":"Implementation and field experiments of cognitive radio system with cooperative spectrum sensing","conferenceDate":"26-29 Oct. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11695197","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Implementation and field experiments of cognitive radio system with cooperative spectrum sensing","confLoc":"Tokyo, Japan","sourcePdf":"6FA115.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077733S","chronDate":"26-29 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5647048","isNumber":"5664831","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5647048","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5664831","articleId":"5665129","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5665144,"authors":[{"name":"Chalit Chusin","affiliation":["College of Data Storage Technology and Applications, King Mongkut''s Institute of Technology Ladkrabang, Bangkok, Thailand"],"firstName":"Chalit","lastName":"Chusin","id":"37590622000"},{"name":"Chutima Prasartkaew","affiliation":["College of Data Storage Technology and Applications, King Mongkut''s Institute of Technology Ladkrabang, Bangkok, Thailand"],"firstName":"Chutima","lastName":"Prasartkaew","id":"37590621300"},{"name":"Sekson Timakul","affiliation":["College of Data Storage Technology and Applications, King Mongkut''s Institute of Technology Ladkrabang, Bangkok, Thailand"],"firstName":"Sekson","lastName":"Timakul","id":"37590628600"},{"name":"Somsak Choomchuay","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering, King Mongkut''s Institute of Technology Ladkrabang, Bangkok, Thailand"],"firstName":"Somsak","lastName":"Choomchuay","id":"37370669700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7010-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7007-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7009-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5665144","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":83},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Parity check codes","Cathode ray tubes","Indexes","Arrays","Facsimile","Manganese","Bit error rate"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["block codes","interleaved codes","matrix algebra","parity check codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nonprime block irregular LDPC codes","CRT","nonprime size submatrices","interleaved codes","SNR","Chinese remainder theorem"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["nonprime","CRT","interleave","LDPC codes","irregular"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents a new design of irregular LDPC codes that supports arbitrary block length.

In order to reduce blocking artifact and preserve high frequency, this paper proposes a novel block processing on wavelet domain instead of spatial domain. No post-processing nor special mapping is included. CS is applied only on blocks where the data are really sparse. An enhancing process, often included for artifact reduction, is no longer necessary. Our algorithm was evaluated by reconstructing three standard images (Lena, Mandrill and Peppers) and then compared with scrambled block hadamard ensemble (SBHE) and block-based CS sampling with a smoothed PL variant using directional discrete wavelet transform (BCS-SPL-DDWT). In the experiment, it provided better reconstruction both objectively (PSNR) and subjectively at low measurement rate. It gave the sharpest image in all cases.

There are several methods that have been developed to eliminate or reduce the computation within a DFT if the input points have many zeros or the number of output points acquired is relatively small, for example, transform decomposition (TD). TD can be seen as a modified Cooley-Tukey FFT where the DFT is decomposed into two smaller DFTs.

This is aligned with the massive requirement of competitiveness compared to other transportation technologies in terms of sustainable energy and high reduction of environmental impact. The installation of stationary storage devices, as widely recognized, allows the recovery of the braking energy for increasing the energy efficiency as well as lower line voltage drops. In the paper, the storage system under investigation is based upon a bidirectional dc-dc converter with supercapacitors, characterized by high power density. The main parameters of the storage system are determined by employing an optimization technique, which in a quite general way is capable of taking into account contemporaneously several aspects in an integrated manner. Some simulations of lines of a suburban railways in Southern Italy managed by Sepsa Company are presented, pointing out how supercapacitors can be practically designed with the proposed technique.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Supercapacitors","Mathematical model","Optimization","Rectifiers","Rail transportation","Substations","Equations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled

It enables to generate a new font by selecting user's favorite fonts from displayed candidates, save font as an image according to users input text, and reuse stored font to the next font creation. To design PALETTE, we focused on Interactive Genetic Algorithm (IGA) technique to take user's subjective desire on font shape into the system. IGA is well known as a method to use user's subjective evaluation interactively. PALETTE has the following modules; (i) create new font candidates base on general font, or stored font characteristics with Kansei label, (ii) generate new fonts using genetic algorithm which can modify each element of the selected candidates, and (iii) export font image and save font characteristics.

The recognition of the speech becomes more difficult when there is a noise in the place. Most of the time human beings are able to ignore the environment noise. The secret of this phenomenon is in the ability of human auditory cortex. Therefore knowing about the functionality of human auditory cortex and its implementation can be helpful to improve the quality of a speech recognition system. The presented system in this paper has two parts. The first part filters the input signal and packs it. Then it gets the average of three packets as an identification of the signal and sends it to the second part. This part which is based on the human auditory cortex is an associative neural network that maps the input set to a desired output set. This system is able to recognize a word even a noisy one.","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 World Automation Congress","pdfPath":"/iel5/5626921/5665275/05665396.pdf","publicationTitle":"2010 World Automation Congress","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5665275","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A biological speech recognition system by using associative neural networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Biology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["content-addressable storage","hearing","neural nets","signal denoising","speech recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biological speech recognition system","associative neural network","signal processing","environment noise","human auditory cortex","signal identification"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Speech Recognition","Neural Network","Associative Memory","Auditory Cortex Function","Neuron","Pitch of the voice"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5665396/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-23 Sept. 2010","displayDocTitle":"A biological speech recognition system by using associative neural networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5665396/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2010","conferenceDate":"19-23 Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11699815","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A biological speech recognition system by using associative neural networks","confLoc":"Kobe, Japan","sourcePdf":"636.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039737S","chronDate":"19-23 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5626921","isNumber":"5665275","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5626921","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5665275","articleId":"5665396","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"TSI Press","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5665409,"authors":[{"name":"Takenori Obo","affiliation":["Department of System Design, Tokyo Metropolitan University, Hino, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Takenori","lastName":"Obo","id":"37590789400"},{"name":"Naoyuki Kubota","affiliation":["Department of System Design, Tokyo Metropolitan University, Hino, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Naoyuki","lastName":"Kubota","id":"37275324300"},{"name":"Toshiyuki Sawayama","affiliation":["Japan Medical Instruments Corporation, Kawanishi, Hyogo, Japan"],"firstName":"Toshiyuki","lastName":"Sawayama","id":"37590791000"},{"name":"Kazuhiko Taniguchi","affiliation":["Kinden Corporation, Kizugawa, Kyoto, Japan"],"firstName":"Kazuhiko","lastName":"Taniguchi","id":"37305725200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-889335-42-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9673-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2154-4824"},{"format":"CD","value":"2154-4824"}],"articleNumber":"5665409","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":90},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A fuzzy spiking neural network using optical oscillosensor and pneumatic sensor for human state estimation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neurons","Robot sensing systems","Humans","State estimation","Artificial neural networks","Optical sensors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["behavioural sciences computing","fuzzy neural nets","geriatrics","health care","optical sensors","patient care","sleep","state estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fuzzy spiking neural network","optical oscillosensor","pneumatic sensor","human state estimation","nursing health facilities","Japan","aged society","sleep","elderly people","health care","human behavior"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["aged society","state estimation","fuzzy theory","spiking neural network","data analysis"]}],"abstract":"Recently, the social role of the nursing health facilities increases more and more as Japan becomes an aged society.

The presence of microcalcifications clusters has been considered as a very important indicator of malignant types of breast cancer and its detection is important to prevent and treat the disease. This paper presents an alternative and effective approach in order to detect microcalcifications clusters in digitized mammograms based on the synergy of the image processing, pattern recognition and artificial intelligence. The mathematical morphology is an image processing technique used for the purpose of image enhancement. A k-means algorithm is used to cluster the data based on the features vectors and finally an artificial neural network-based classifier is applied and the classification performance is evaluated by a ROC curve. Experimental results indicate that the percentage of correct classification was 99.72%, obtaining 100% true positive (sensitivity) and 99.67% false positive (specificity), with the best classifier proposed. In case of the best classifier, we obtained a performance evaluation of classification of Az = 0.9875.","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 World Automation Congress","pdfPath":"/iel5/5626921/5665275/05665695.pdf","publicationTitle":"2010 World Automation Congress","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5665275","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Microcalcification detection applying artificial neural networks and mathematical morphology in digital mammograms","keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["artificial intelligence","cancer","image classification","image enhancement","mathematical morphology","medical image processing","neural nets","patient treatment","pattern clustering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["microcalcification cluster detection","artificial neural network","mathematical morphology","digital mammogram","breast cancer","disease","image processing","pattern recognition","artificial intelligence","image enhancement"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Microcalcifications Clusters","Mathematical Morphology","Artificial Neural Networks","Pattern Recognition"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5665695/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-23 Sept. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Microcalcification detection applying artificial neural networks and mathematical morphology in digital mammograms","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5665695/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2010","conferenceDate":"19-23 Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11699860","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Microcalcification detection applying artificial neural networks and mathematical morphology in digital mammograms","confLoc":"Kobe, Japan","sourcePdf":"166.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052639S","chronDate":"19-23 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5626921","isNumber":"5665275","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5626921","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5665275","articleId":"5665695","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"TSI Press","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5665739,"authors":[{"name":"Javier Matamoros","affiliation":["Centre Technol\u00f3gic de Telecomunicacions de Catalunya (CTTC), Castelldefels, Barcelona, Spain"],"firstName":"Javier","lastName":"Matamoros","id":"38273029700"},{"name":"Carles Ant\u00f3n-Haro","affiliation":["Centre Technol\u00f3gic de Telecomunicacions de Catalunya (CTTC), Castelldefels, Barcelona, Spain"],"firstName":"Carles","lastName":"Ant\u00f3n-Haro","id":"38272518500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"5665739","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":438},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resource management","Wireless sensor networks","Upper bound","Wireless communication","Computational complexity","AWGN","Approximation methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplify and forward communication","parameter estimation","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["opportunistic power allocation scheme","amplify-and-forward wireless sensor networks","decentralized parameter estimation","uniform power allocation","optimal water-filling strategies"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Opportunistic communications","wireless sensor networks","decentralized parameter estimation"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5665739","doi":"10.1109/LCOMM.2010.120610.101364","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCOMM.2010.120610.101364","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5710618","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/4234/5710618/05665739.pdf","startPage":"169","endPage":"171","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Scaling Law of an Opportunistic Power Allocation Scheme for Amplify-and-Forward Wireless Sensor Networks","abstract":"In this letter, we address the problem of decentralized parameter estimation with Amplify-and-Forward Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs).

The behavior of structures that are subject to such forces, even simple ones such as clamped-clamped or cantilever beams, is difficult to model in a way that is both computationally efficient and physically meaningful. The main contribution of this paper is a semianalytical modeling approach for microbeams that are subject to inverse power-law force densities, which is accurate, computationally efficient, and amenable to physical interpretation. This approach is based on the observation that, for large deformations, inverse power-law forces affect all mathematically equivalent shapes in the same way. Starting from reference shapes for which the analytical expressions of the Galerkin projection of the inverse power-law forces are known, semianalytical expressions are then established for all equivalent shapes, using a simple least squares fitting procedure. In a context of transient simulation, the resulting models are economical because they do not require costly deformation-dependent integral evaluations. Furthermore, they can be used to establish analytical expressions of relevant physical quantities. This approach is validated with simulated and experimental data and compared qualitatively and quantitatively to other reduced-order modeling methods.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5665746/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 December 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5665746/","dateOfInsertion":"31 January 2011","publicationDate":"Feb. 2011","accessionNumber":"11804840","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"20","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Modeling of Micromachined Beams Subject to Nonlinear Restoring or Damping Forces","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modeling of Micromachined Beams Subject to Nonlinear Restoring or Damping Forces","sourcePdf":"jmems-juillard-2090650-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.077162S","chronDate":"Feb.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"84","isNumber":"5705607","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"84","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"5705607","articleId":"5665746","onlineDate":"13 December 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5665753,"authors":[{"name":"G.

The problem is particularly difficult in the presence of large intraclass variability, e.g., finding \u201cboats\u201d or \u201cbuildings,\u201d where model-based approaches tend to fail because no good model or template can be defined for the highly variable targets. This paper explores an automatic approach to detect and classify targets in high-resolution broad-area satellite images, which relies on detecting statistical signatures of targets, in terms of a set of biologically-inspired low-level visual features. Broad-area images are cut into small image chips, analyzed in two complementary ways: \u201cattention/saliency\u201d analysis exploits local features and their interactions across space, while \u201cgist\u201d analysis focuses on global nonspatial features and their statistics. Both feature sets are used to classify each chip as containing target(s) or not, using a support vector machine. Four experiments were performed to find \u201cboats\u201d (Experiments 1 and 2), \u201cbuildings\u201d (Experiment 3) and \u201cairplanes\u201d (Experiment 4). In experiment 1, 14 416 image chips were randomly divided into training (300 boat, 300 nonboat) and test sets (13 816), and classification was performed on the test set (ROC area: 0.977 \u00b10.003). In experiment 2, classification was performed on another test set of 11 385 chips from another broad-area image, keeping the same training set as in experiment 1 (ROC area: 0.952 \u00b10.006). In experiment 3, 600 training chips (300 for each type) were randomly selected from 108 885 chips, and classification was conducted (ROC area: 0.922 \u00b10.005). In experiment 4, 20 training chips (10 for each type) were randomly selected to classify the remaining 2581 chips (ROC area: 0.976 \u00b10.003). The proposed algorithm outperformed the state-of-the-art SIFT, HMAX, and hidden-scale salient structure methods, and previous gist-only features in all four experiments. This study shows that the proposed target search method can reliably and effectively detect highly variable target objects in large image datasets.","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2010.2099128","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","startPage":"2017","endPage":"2029","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2010.2099128","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5876607","pdfPath":"/iel5/83/5876607/05665771.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Feature extraction","Satellites","Visualization","Object detection","Humans","Computational modeling","Biological system modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital signal processing chips","geographic information systems","object detection","statistical analysis","support vector machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["gist features","saliency features","target detection","satellite images","object detection","statistical signatures","image chips","support vector machine","SIFT","HMAX"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Gist features","saliency features","satellite images","target detection"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Saliency and Gist Features for Target Detection in Satellite Images","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5665771/","volume":"20","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/5665771/","accessionNumber":"12063094","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"pubMedId":"21156392","dateOfInsertion":"16 June 2011","publicationDate":"July 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 December 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2011","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Saliency and Gist Features for Target Detection in Satellite Images","sourcePdf":"tip-li-2099128-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.082325S","chronDate":"July  2011","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"5876607","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"108","xplore-issue":"5876607","articleId":"5665771","onlineDate":"13 December 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5665773,"authors":[{"name":"Yanchao Dong","affiliation":["Graduate School of Science and Technology, Kumamoto University, Kumamoto, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6979/5779921/5665773/5665773-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yanchao Dong received the B.Eng. and M.Eng. degrees from Shanghai Tongji University, Shanghai, China, in 2005 and 2008.

Driver inattention is a major factor in most traffic accidents. Research and development has actively been carried out for decades, with the goal of precisely determining the drivers' state of mind. In this paper, we summarize these approaches by dividing them into the following five different types of measures: 1) subjective report measures; 2) driver biological measures; 3) driver physical measures; 4) driving performance measures; and 5) hybrid measures. Among these approaches, subjective report measures and driver biological measures are not suitable under real driving conditions but could serve as some rough ground-truth indicators. The hybrid measures are believed to give more reliable solutions compared with single driver physical measures or driving performance measures, because the hybrid measures minimize the number of false alarms and maintain a high recognition rate, which promote the acceptance of the system. We also discuss some nonlinear modeling techniques commonly used in the literature.","doi":"10.1109/TITS.2010.2092770","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/6979/5779921/05665773.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TITS.2010.2092770","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5779921","startPage":"596","endPage":"614","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Driver Inattention Monitoring System for Intelligent Vehicles: A Review","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5665773","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Driver Inattention Monitoring System for Intelligent Vehicles: A Review","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5665773/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 December 2010","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"12","issue":"2","publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12032313","dateOfInsertion":"31 May 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5665773/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Driver Inattention Monitoring System for Intelligent Vehicles: A Review","sourcePdf":"tits-dong-2092770-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.167558S","chronDate":"June  2011","xplore-pub-id":"6979","isNumber":"5779921","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6979","citationCount":"370","xplore-issue":"5779921","articleId":"5665773","onlineDate":"13 December 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":5665777,"authors":[{"name":"Christian Wessels","affiliation":["Institute for Power Electronics and Electrical Drives, Christian-Albrechts-University of Kiel, Kaiserstr. 2, Germany"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/5767815/5665777/5665777-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Christian Wessels (S'08) was born in Hamburg, Germany, in 1981.

In this paper, we propose a context-aware system that reduces the energy consumption by controlling the sampling frequency of wearable sensors. Even if the sampling frequency changes, no extra configuration is required because the missing data for the controlled sensors are complemented by our proposed algorithm. The evaluation results confirmed a power-reduction of 34.28% with keeping the accuracy. The energy consumption can be reduced without a large loss in accuracy using our system.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wrist"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy conservation","sensors","ubiquitous computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy saving method","context-aware system","data complement","sampling frequency control","wearable sensors"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ISWC.2010.5665860","publicationTitle":"International Symposium on Wearable Computers (ISWC) 2010","displayPublicationTitle":"International Symposium on Wearable Computers (ISWC) 2010","pdfPath":"/iel5/5648406/5665849/05665860.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5665849","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISWC.2010.5665860","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A method for energy saving on context-aware system by sampling control and data complement","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5665860","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A method for energy saving on context-aware system by sampling control and data complement","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5665860/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5665860/","accessionNumber":"11697590","conferenceDate":"10-13 Oct. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"13 December 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 Oct. 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A method for energy saving on context-aware system by sampling control and data complement","confLoc":"Seoul, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"156.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.03815S","chronDate":"10-13 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5648406","isNumber":"5665849","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5648406","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5665849","articleId":"5665860","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5665869,"authors":[{"name":"Ulf Blanke","affiliation":["Computer Science, Technical University of Darmstadt, Germany"],"firstName":"Ulf","lastName":"Blanke","id":"37393034500"},{"name":"Bernt Schiele","affiliation":["MPI Informatics, Saarbruecken, Germany"],"firstName":"Bernt","lastName":"Schiele","id":"37265607300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9045-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9046-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2376-8541"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-4816"}],"articleNumber":"5665869","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":30,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":492},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hidden Markov models","Training data","Training","Mirrors","Data models","Knowledge transfer","Joints"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image motion analysis","image recognition","learning (artificial intelligence)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["activity spotting","activity recognition approach","machine learning technique","training data"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5665869","abstract":"Activity recognition approaches have shown to enable good performance for a wide variety of applications. Most approaches rely on machine learning techniques requiring significant amounts of training data for each application. Consequently they have to be retrained for each new application limiting the real-world applicability of today's activity recognition methods. This paper explores the possibility to transfer learned knowledge from one application to others thereby significantly reducing the required training data for new applications. To achieve this transferability the paper proposes a new layered activity recognition approach that lends itself to transfer knowledge across applications. Besides allowing to transfer knowledge across applications this layered approach also shows improved recognition performance both of composite activities as well as of activity events.","doi":"10.1109/ISWC.2010.5665869","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISWC.2010.5665869","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","displayPublicationTitle":"International Symposium on Wearable Computers (ISWC) 2010","pdfPath":"/iel5/5648406/5665849/05665869.pdf","publicationTitle":"International Symposium on Wearable Computers (ISWC) 2010","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5665849","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Remember and transfer what you have learned - recognizing composite activities based on activity spotting","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 Oct. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Remember and transfer what you have learned - recognizing composite activities based on activity spotting","conferenceDate":"10-13 Oct. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"13 December 2010","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5665869/","accessionNumber":"11697578","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5665869/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Remember and transfer what you have learned - recognizing composite activities based on activity spotting","confLoc":"Seoul, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"143.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076683S","chronDate":"10-13 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5648406","isNumber":"5665849","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5648406","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"5665849","articleId":"5665869","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-24"},{"_id":5665994,"authors":[{"name":"Rui Morais","affiliation":["Department of Electronics, Telecommunications and Informatics, University of Aveiro, Aveiro, Portugal"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4563700/5730117/5665994/5665994-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Rui Manuel Morais was born in Gouveia, Portugal.

Power quality (PQ) disturbances analysis is the focus of power quality control. The characteristics of PQ disturbances include short duration, variety of types and so on. Power quality disturbances classification is the foundation of power quality control automation. Different types of Neural network, such as BP neural networks, RBF neural networks and probabilistic neural network etc, is already applied in the area of PQ disturbances classification and recognition. The researches about the neural network for PQ disturbances recognition are mainly focused on the optimizing for the signal type of neural network. But the accuracy rate of the classification is still needed to be improved. Ensemble and hybrid algorithms research is currently flourishing in pattern classification machine learning and decision sciences. Compare to traditional NN, the ensemble and hybrid NN classifier achieves higher classification rate. In this paper, a novel PQ classification system using S-transform and ensemble and hybrid NN is designed. There are 2 stages in the novel system. Firstly, the PQ disturbances signals are transformed by S-transform and the subset of features extracted from the result of S-transform is used as the input vector of the ensemble and hybrid NN. Secondly in the pattern classification process, BP network and RBF neural network are utilized as two classification agents. Through choosing different parameters and different samples, every agent includes a group of neural networks. The classification results, generated by different agents, are fuzzified into fuzzy numbers. The centroid of all fuzzy numbers is compared with the threshold. Finally we obtain the classification results. In the simulation, 6 types of disturbances signals which are simulated by Matlab 7.0 use for test the new classification system. Simulation result shows that when the new system has better classification rate especially at the high noising environment.","doi":"10.1109/POWERCON.2010.5666027","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Power System Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/5645358/5666013/05666027.pdf","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Power System Technology","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/POWERCON.2010.5666027","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5666013","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Power quality disturbances classification by ensemble and hybrid Neural networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Artificial neural networks","Chemicals","Harmonic analysis","Pattern recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fault diagnosis","fuzzy set theory","learning (artificial intelligence)","neural nets","power engineering computing","power supply quality"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power quality disturbances classification","hybrid neural networks","ensemble neural network structure","power quality control automation","BP neural networks","PQ disturbances recognition","pattern classification machine learning","decision sciences","S-transform","fuzzy numbers","Matlab 7.0"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["power quality","power quality disturbances","neural network","ensemble","hybrid"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Geoscience"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5666027/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 Oct. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Power quality disturbances classification by ensemble and hybrid Neural networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5666027/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"13 December 2010","conferenceDate":"24-28 Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11700532","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power quality disturbances classification by ensemble and hybrid Neural networks","confLoc":"Zhejiang, China","sourcePdf":"CP0872FF.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062933S","chronDate":"24-28 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5645358","isNumber":"5666013","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5645358","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5666013","articleId":"5666027","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5666062,"authors":[{"name":"Robert C.

This methodology improves performance of MCS by pruning state spaces in such a manner that a new state space with a higher density of failure states than the original state space is created. We have previously proposed using Population-based Intelligent Search (PIS), specifically Genetic Algorithms (GA) and Binary Particle Swarm Optimization (BPSO), to prune the state space. This paper reexamines these techniques, suggests improvements, examines the extension of these techniques to a larger test system, and extends the method to include both Repulsive Binary Particle Swarm Optimization (RBPSO) and Binary Ant Colony Optimization (BACO).

However, these power generations cannot supply constant electric power output and sometimes cause the imbalance between supply and demand. To alleviate the mentioned problem, Battery Energy Storage System (BESS), which is significantly expensive, is indispensable. A new idea of Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) is that a battery of Electric-Vehicle (EV) can be used as an equivalent large-scale BESS in a power system. Thus, the deployment of EVs can reduce the required capacity of BESS. This paper proposes a V2G model considering EV customers' convenience and the State Of Charge (SOC) control method by the local control centers which enables the SOCs of the EVs to be synchronized. The simulation results show that the EVs equipped with the V2G controller can help the conventional thermal power plants suppress the system frequency fluctuation.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/POWERCON.2010.5666064","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5666013","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Power System Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/5645358/5666013/05666064.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Load Frequency Control in power system using Vehicle-to-Grid system considering the customer convenience of Electric Vehicles","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Geoscience"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5666064/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 Oct. 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5666064/","displayDocTitle":"Load Frequency Control in power system using Vehicle-to-Grid system considering the customer convenience of Electric Vehicles","conferenceDate":"24-28 Oct. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11700152","dateOfInsertion":"13 December 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Load Frequency Control in power system using Vehicle-to-Grid system considering the customer convenience of Electric Vehicles","confLoc":"Zhejiang, China","sourcePdf":"FP0658FF.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.079077S","chronDate":"24-28 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5645358","isNumber":"5666013","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5645358","citationCount":"76","xplore-issue":"5666013","articleId":"5666064","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5666080,"authors":[{"name":"Amit Jain","affiliation":["Power Systems Research Center, Hyderabad, Andhra Pradesh, India"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5645358/5666013/5666080/5666080-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Amit Jain graduated from KNIT, India in Electrical Engineering.

Distributed Antenna Systems using Fiber-optics distribution (F-DAS) represent a suitable method of extending multiple-operator radio coverage into indoor premises, tunnels, etc. Another key point is the adoption of MIMO (Multiple Input-Multiple Output) transmission techniques which can exploit the multipath nature of the radio link to ensure reliable, high-speed wireless communication in hostile environments. In this paper novel indoor deployment solutions based on Radio over Fiber (RoF) and distributed-antenna MIMO techniques are presented and discussed, highlighting their potential in different cases.","doi":"10.1109/LAPC.2010.5666190","publicationTitle":"2010 Loughborough Antennas & Propagation Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 Loughborough Antennas & Propagation Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5655388/5665995/05666190.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LAPC.2010.5666190","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5665995","startPage":"505","endPage":"508","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Characterization of an Interleaved F-DAS MIMO indoor propagation channel","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5666190","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Characterization of an Interleaved F-DAS MIMO indoor propagation channel","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-9 Nov. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5666190/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"8-9 Nov. 2010","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2010","accessionNumber":"11696274","dateOfInsertion":"13 December 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5666190/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Characterization of an Interleaved F-DAS MIMO indoor propagation channel","confLoc":"Loughborough, UK","sourcePdf":"120Tarlazzi.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045944S","chronDate":"8-9 Nov. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5655388","isNumber":"5665995","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5655388","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"5665995","articleId":"5666190","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":5666191,"authors":[{"name":"Qian Li","affiliation":["Wireless Communications Research Group, Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, Loughborough University, UK"],"firstName":"Qian","lastName":"Li","id":"37536134300"},{"name":"Alexandres P.

Measured input response data show agreement in resonant frequency with FDTD simulations to within 1%. The single element is highly linearly polarised, has a maximum gain of 10dB and an estimated efficiency of 95% (all the errors in measurement having been identified systematically).

Compressed sensing is a technique for acquiring and reconstructing a signal or image utilizing the prior knowledge that is sparse or compressible. During the past several decades scholars have made all sorts of guesses about the prior Pr(x) for images in order to find its sparse representation and also proposed some available algorithms like matching pursuit (MP) and orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) algorithms. Some reconstruction algorithms used the convex relaxation method, but the conjugate gradient is a method with simpler iterative process and less memory requirement compared with the least square and Newton iteration. Simulation results show that this image reconstruction algorithm based on compressed sensing using conjugate gradient gets better performance on time and PSNR than OMP algorithm.","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 4th International Universal Communication Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/5654670/5666004/05666245.pdf","startPage":"374","endPage":"377","publicationTitle":"2010 4th International Universal Communication Symposium","doi":"10.1109/IUCS.2010.5666245","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IUCS.2010.5666245","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5666004","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5666245","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An image reconstruction algorithm based on compressed sensing using conjugate gradient","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Compressed sensing","Matching pursuit algorithms","Image reconstruction","Image coding","PSNR","Dictionaries","Reconstruction algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["conjugate gradient methods","image matching","image reconstruction","least squares approximations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compressed sensing","conjugate gradient method","image reconstruction algorithm","sparse representation","orthogonal matching pursuit algorithm","convex relaxation method","iterative process","least square","Newton iteration","PSNR"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["image reconstruction","compressed sensing","OMP","conjugate gradient"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5666245/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-19 Oct. 2010","displayDocTitle":"An image reconstruction algorithm based on compressed sensing using conjugate gradient","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5666245/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11697783","dateOfInsertion":"13 December 2010","conferenceDate":"18-19 Oct. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An image reconstruction algorithm based on compressed sensing using conjugate gradient","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"Paper063.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062748S","chronDate":"18-19 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5654670","isNumber":"5666004","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5654670","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5666004","articleId":"5666245","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":5666251,"authors":[{"name":"Huilan Wang","affiliation":["PLA University of Foreign languages Luoyang, China"],"firstName":"Huilan","lastName":"Wang","id":"37599273600"},{"name":"Keliang Zhang","affiliation":["PLA University of Foreign languages Luoyang, China"],"firstName":"Keliang","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37595716500"},{"name":"Yali Li","affiliation":["PLA University of Foreign languages Luoyang, China"],"firstName":"Yali","lastName":"Li","id":"37405734900"},{"name":"YongHong Yan","affiliation":["PLA University of Foreign languages Luoyang, China"],"firstName":"YongHong","lastName":"Yan","id":"37274724000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7820-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7821-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-7819-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5666251","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":275},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5666251","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Pragmatics","Artificial neural networks","Correlation","Grammar","Statistical analysis","Feature extraction","Computational modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational linguistics","correlation methods","grammars","natural language processing","statistical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automated essay scoring system","linguistic feature-thematic feature","functional grammar","thematic structure","correlation analysis","AES corpus","statistical analysis","RB-PRP ratio extraction","natural language processing"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["linguistic feature","theme","Automated Essay Scoring"]}],"abstract":"This study reviews the features used in the previous Automated Essay Scoring (AES) system, and attempts to develop a new linguistic feature-thematic feature for AES systems. According to Functional Grammar, theme is the point of departure for message, the element with which the clause is concerned. The thematic structure is an important method to promote essay coherence, and to present the message structure of essays. In order to find out whether the thematic feature distinguish the differences between those essays that were rated as high and those rated as low, or the feature is a valid predictor for AES system, we conduct a correlation analysis on the AES corpus, which consists of 2,000 expert-graded College English Test essays. Based on the statistical analysis, we extract the RB-PRP ratio as the formalized form of the thematic feature. Findings of the study indicate that the thematic feature has a significant positive correlation with the human-assigned essay scores. And the performance results indicate that the thematic feature promotes the performance of the AES baseline system. The findings of the study also indicate that linguistic research in traditional linguistic area is valuable for constructing a statistical model in the area of natural language processing (NLP), especially in the process of selecting intelligent linguistic features which are predictable for NLP systems.","doi":"10.1109/IUCS.2010.5666251","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5666004","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IUCS.2010.5666251","publicationTitle":"2010 4th International Universal Communication Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 4th International Universal Communication Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/5654670/5666004/05666251.pdf","startPage":"340","endPage":"344","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new linguistic feature for Automated Essay Scoring","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"18-19 Oct. 2010","displayDocTitle":"A new linguistic feature for Automated Essay Scoring","isConference":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"18-19 Oct. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"13 December 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5666251/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11697788","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5666251/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new linguistic feature for Automated Essay Scoring","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"Paper057.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.148614S","chronDate":"18-19 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5654670","isNumber":"5666004","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5654670","xplore-issue":"5666004","articleId":"5666251","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5666262,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

In order to send command information from master controller to slave controller, centralized control must have a high bandwidth communication channel, which is not suitable to execute the peer-to-peer and plug-play control. And when a new micro-source is interconnected to the micro-grid, the master controller will have to adjust all the micro-source once more. Decentralised control is operated using only local information, but, because without reference from the global pattern, the global optimal performance can't be guaranteed as firmly as with global controllers. In this paper, a novel hierarchical control for micro-grid is proposed, this control method still have a certain degree of decentralisation but also keep a degree of centralization through a higher level control layer that controls lower level units. The hierarchical control is mainly consisted of three control levels: primary control, secondary control and tertiary control. Experimental results are provided to show the feasibility of the hierarchical control method.","doi":"10.1109/POWERCON.2010.5666418","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Power System Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Power System Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/5645358/5666013/05666418.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/POWERCON.2010.5666418","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5666013","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hierarchical control techniques applied in micro-grid","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5666418","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Geoscience"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Hierarchical control techniques applied in micro-grid","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 Oct. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5666418/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"24-28 Oct. 2010","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11700538","dateOfInsertion":"13 December 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5666418/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hierarchical control techniques applied in micro-grid","confLoc":"Zhejiang, China","sourcePdf":"CP0320.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068542S","chronDate":"24-28 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5645358","isNumber":"5666013","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5645358","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"5666013","articleId":"5666418","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5666422,"authors":[{"name":"Hua Ye","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Shandong University, Jinan, China"],"firstName":"Hua","lastName":"Ye","id":"37398677700"},{"name":"Yutian Liu","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Shandong University, Jinan, China"],"firstName":"Yutian","lastName":"Liu","id":"37279423700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5940-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5938-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5939-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5666422","dbTime":"16 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":282},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5666422","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Adaptation model","Optimization","Noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive control","closed loop systems","optimal control","power system control","predictive control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wide-area model predictive damping controller","online recursive closed-loop subspace identification","adaptive damping controller design method","integrating online recursive closed-loop subspace model identification","predictive control theory","closed-loop optimal control","system parameters","multi-machine power systems","power system damping controllers"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["closed-loop identification","subspace identification","damping control","model predictive control"]}],"abstract":"This paper proposes an adaptive damping controller design method by integrating online recursive closed-loop subspace model identification with model predictive control theory.

The strategy overcomes the inherent shortcomings of controllers with fixed parameters based on offline identification thus solves the problem of the control performance degradation due to variation of the complex operation conditions and time-varying and uncertain characteristic of system parameters.

The previous researches of LCC technology are reviewed. The cost breakdown structure is described in detail particularly from the device layer and the system layer. The maintenance costs combining with Reliability Centered Maintenance (RCM) and the failure costs combining with outage costs are analyzed significantly.

UPQC is used to mitigate both voltage and current power quality (PQ) problems. During the process of mitigation, UPQC is supposed to inject real and reactive power into the system to mitigate current (shunt) and voltage (series) power quality (PQ) problems. As per the sensitive load concerns, deep and long duration sags are more vulnerable than shallow and short duration sags. To resolve these issues a new methodology is proposed with optimal Volt-Ampere (VA) loading on UPQC to mitigate deep and long duration unbalanced sag with phase jumps. Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is utilized as a tool for evaluating the optimal VA loading of UPQC with constraints like magnitude of injected voltage from Series active power filter, Total Harmonic Distortion (THD) of source current and terminal voltage. The proposed methodology ensures optimal VA loading on UPQC without compromising mitigation capability of the UPQC. The proposed method has been validated through detailed simulation studies.","doi":"10.1109/POWERCON.2010.5666492","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Power System Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Power System Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/5645358/5666013/05666492.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/POWERCON.2010.5666492","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5666013","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal VA loading of UPQC during mitigation of unbalanced voltage sags with phase jumps in three-phase four-wire distribution system","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5666492","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Geoscience"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Optimal VA loading of UPQC during mitigation of unbalanced voltage sags with phase jumps in three-phase four-wire distribution system","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 Oct. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5666492/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"24-28 Oct. 2010","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11700259","dateOfInsertion":"13 December 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5666492/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal VA loading of UPQC during mitigation of unbalanced voltage sags with phase jumps in three-phase four-wire distribution system","confLoc":"Zhejiang, China","sourcePdf":"FP0049FF.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056545S","chronDate":"24-28 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5645358","isNumber":"5666013","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5645358","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5666013","articleId":"5666492","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":5666532,"authors":[{"name":"W.

Based on binary particle swarm optimization, a novel method is proposed to identify the backbone-grid in power grid. First, the concept of the backbone-grid is defined for mathematically describing the critical lines and important topology structure which are crucial for power system to prevent the blackout caused by cascading failures. On this basis, the problem of exploring backbone-grid is further formulated as a mixed integer nonlinear programming problem which is to be solved with binary particle swarm optimization. The problem just needs to be optimized only once. The backbone-grid essential to the safe and stable operation of power grid can be obtained. Simulation on IEEE RTS-79 system verifies that the proposed method can identify backbone-grid with high computational efficiency.","doi":"10.1109/POWERCON.2010.5666532","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Power System Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/5645358/5666013/05666532.pdf","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Power System Technology","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/POWERCON.2010.5666532","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5666013","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Identification of backbone-grid in power grid based on binary particle swarm optimization","keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["integer programming","nonlinear programming","particle swarm optimisation","power grids","power system faults"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["backbone-grid identification","power grid","binary particle swarm optimization","power system","mixed integer nonlinear programming","IEEE RTS-79 system","cascading failures"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["backbone-grid","binary particle swarm optimization","cascading failures","power grid"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Geoscience"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5666532/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 Oct. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Identification of backbone-grid in power grid based on binary particle swarm optimization","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5666532/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"13 December 2010","conferenceDate":"24-28 Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11700442","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Identification of backbone-grid in power grid based on binary particle swarm optimization","confLoc":"Zhejiang, China","sourcePdf":"CP1320FF.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.102615S","chronDate":"24-28 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5645358","isNumber":"5666013","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5645358","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5666013","articleId":"5666532","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":5666534,"authors":[{"name":"F.

Although wide-area measurement system (WMAS) is being widely applied to monitor and control the interconnected power systems, which can enable the use of measured signals from remote locations for centralized control purpose, the impact of time delays introduced by remote signal transmission and processing in WAMS cannot be ignored. So this paper describes the TCSC wide-area damping controller design problem of power system as a public time-delay feedback control problem. Based on the established time-delay power system model, the TCSC wide-area damping controller is proposed by the free-weighting matrices method, which is expressed with a set of linear matrix inequality (LMI) constraints, and the pole placement method. Finally, the simulation results on a two-area four-machine test system are illustrated by comparing with various time delays of wide-area signals. It demonstrates that the designed TCSC damping controller not only inhibits inter-area oscillation evidently, but also is robust to various time delays.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5666013","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/POWERCON.2010.5666534","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Power System Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Power System Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/5645358/5666013/05666534.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doi":"10.1109/POWERCON.2010.5666534","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"TCSC wide-area damping controller to enhance the damping of inter-area oscillation for power systems with considering the time delay of wide-area signals","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Geoscience"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 Oct. 2010","displayDocTitle":"TCSC wide-area damping controller to enhance the damping of inter-area oscillation for power systems with considering the time delay of wide-area signals","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"24-28 Oct. 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5666534/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11700255","dateOfInsertion":"13 December 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5666534/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"TCSC wide-area damping controller to enhance the damping of inter-area oscillation for power systems with considering the time delay of wide-area signals","confLoc":"Zhejiang, China","sourcePdf":"FP0541FF.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067631S","chronDate":"24-28 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5645358","isNumber":"5666013","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5645358","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5666013","articleId":"5666534","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5666543,"authors":[{"name":"Gwo-Ching Liao","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Fortune Institute of Technology, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5645358/5666013/5666543/5666543-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Gwo-Ching Liao (M'04) He received his MS-EE from the National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan in 1991 and the Ph.D degree from National Sun Yat-Sen University, Kaohsiung.

Economic Dispatch determines the electrical power to be generated by the committed generating units in a power system so that the generation cost can minimized, while satisfying various load demands simultaneously. The model of Bid-Based Dynamic Economic Dispatch is proposed in order to maximize the social profit under the competitive environment of electricity market. This model synthetically considers various constraints on ramp rates, transmission line capacity and polluting gas emission constraints etc. The Isolation Niche Immune Genetic Algorithm was induced as a new solution for this model. With the introduction of niche technology, the capability of the immune genetic algorithm in dealing with the optimization of multi-peak model function was enhanced. This paper proposed the Niche based on Isolation mechanism which possesses with biological basis. It not only effectively ensures the diversity solutions of the group, but also has a strong ability to guide evolution. On the other hand, the use of immune genetic algorithm itself is a very good and innovative method in the solution for multi-peak model function. A new improving method for this algorithm was also presented in this paper. This research integrated the applications of these two methods to enhance the evolutionary capability in seeking a more optimal solution for solving nonlinear programming. The result of the application of this integrated method for the proposed test had been very good.","doi":"10.1109/POWERCON.2010.5666543","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Power System Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/5645358/5666013/05666543.pdf","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Power System Technology","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/POWERCON.2010.5666543","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5666013","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Application novel Immune Genetic Algorithm for solving Bid-Based Dynamic Economic power load dispatch","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Biological system modeling","Load modeling","Computational modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["commerce","genetic algorithms","nonlinear programming","power generation dispatch","power generation economics","power markets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bid-based dynamic economic power load dispatch","algorithm-isolation niche immune genetic algorithm","INIGA-BDED","power generation dispatch","electricity market","multipeak model function","nonlinear programming"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Isolation Niche","Immune Genetic Algorithm","Dynamic Economic Dispatch","Bid-Based"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Geoscience"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5666543/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 Oct. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Application novel Immune Genetic Algorithm for solving Bid-Based Dynamic Economic power load dispatch","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5666543/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"13 December 2010","conferenceDate":"24-28 Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11700202","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Application novel Immune Genetic Algorithm for solving Bid-Based Dynamic Economic power load dispatch","confLoc":"Zhejiang, China","sourcePdf":"FP0547FF.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.086906S","chronDate":"24-28 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5645358","isNumber":"5666013","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5645358","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5666013","articleId":"5666543","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5666546,"authors":[{"name":"Ming-Tang Tsai","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Shiu University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Ming-Tang Tsai","id":"37593964800"},{"name":"Chin-Wei Yen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Shiu University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Chin-Wei Yen","id":"37593999300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5940-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5938-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5939-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5666546","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":372},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5666546","abstract":"This paper presents an Improved Particles Swarm Optimization(IPSO) to the economic dispatch problems with carbon tax consideration.

Firstly, the basic design concept and the related design flow are presented. Then, the general wide-area power system model with the time-delay characteristic is described by the linearization modeling method. The practical reduced-order algorithm is introduced to further obtain the reduced system state-space model that maintains the low-frequency oscillation mode. Furthermore, considering the inevitable time delay in the wide-area feedback control signals transmitted by the wide-area measurement system (WAMS), the improved linear matrix inequality (LMI) method is applied to design the robust supplementary damping controller associated to the HVDC converter pole-control. Such controller can efficiently suppress the negative effect of time delay of the wide-area control signals on the oscillation damping performance. In addition, the iterative algorithm is proposed to search the optimal overall gain matrix for the state feedback control, and the state observer is also designed based on the classic pole-placement method to realize the observability on the state variables of the reduced system. Finally, a case study on a benchmark system of small signal stability study is performed to validate the proposed HVDC wide-area time-delay damping control strategy.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Geoscience"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5666549/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 Oct. 2010","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"24-28 Oct. 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5666549/","dateOfInsertion":"13 December 2010","publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11700268","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Wide-area time-delay damping control to prevent power oscillations in HVDC/AC interconnected power systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wide-area time-delay damping control to prevent power oscillations in HVDC/AC interconnected power systems","confLoc":"Zhejiang, China","sourcePdf":"FP0559FF.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.080054S","chronDate":"24-28 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5645358","isNumber":"5666013","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5645358","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"5666013","articleId":"5666549","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5666564,"authors":[{"name":"Peter Ah\u010din","affiliation":["ETH Zurich, Switzerland"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5645358/5666013/5666564/5666564-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Peter Ah\u010din was born in Ljubljana, Slovenia.

The mentioned approach, called the energy hub, developed at the ETH Zurich, is used to simulate energy generation and storage units of an energy system and is particularly suitable for hourly or quarter-hourly unit dispatch cost optimization. The paper's first contribution is to show how the model of the generation and storage units of a system can be extended through demand response, to include the energy consumption side as an active participant in the system. The demand response schemes have a similar effect as energy storage and are defined as an analogue to energy storage units. The modeling approach and its utility are demonstrated through examples based on a city quarter of around 1.000 households in which buildings are currently heated with gas and oil boilers. The examples show how heat load management in combination with heat pumps and different cogeneration systems can influence load behaviour and total energy costs. For each system setting, energy inputs into the system are optimized for each hour of the chosen day. Fuel costs are naturally constant through the day and the whole dynamics of the system is determined by the changes in the electricity spot market price. In the end a comparison is given, of the original system of only gas and oil boilers with possible alternative heating systems including heat pumps, micro gasification CHP units and two different district heating systems. These systems are compared with one another with and without the use of heat load management according to their fuel and electricity costs as well as the ensuing greenhouse gas emissions.","doi":"10.1109/POWERCON.2010.5666564","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Power System Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Power System Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/5645358/5666013/05666564.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/POWERCON.2010.5666564","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5666013","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Simulating demand response and energy storage in energy distribution systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5666564","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Geoscience"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Simulating demand response and energy storage in energy distribution systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 Oct. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5666564/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"24-28 Oct. 2010","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11700453","dateOfInsertion":"13 December 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5666564/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Simulating demand response and energy storage in energy distribution systems","confLoc":"Zhejiang, China","sourcePdf":"FP1011FF.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042188S","chronDate":"24-28 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5645358","isNumber":"5666013","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5645358","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"5666013","articleId":"5666564","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5666600,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Optimal coordination of over current relays has been usually solved using linear and nonlinear programming. Also genetic algorithm and particle swarm optimization methods are used to fined the optimal solution of the problem. In this paper a new hybrid approach will be used for optimal coordination of over current relays. In this work, both time setting multiplier (TMS) and current setting (IP) are taken into account in the optimization procedure. The former is consider as a continues parameter and the later is assumed to be discrete parameter. The novelty of this paper is that quantizing IP parameter is taken into account as a part of optimization producer in the particle swarm optimization iterations. After that, we can calculate the optimum TMS with linear programming at the end of each iteration of PSO optimization algorithm. To increase the accuracy of proposed algorithm, first particle positions of swarms was calculated with linear approaches. Both near-end and far-end faults are taken into account in the constraint of the optimal coordination problem and the results are compared with the other methods. The obtained results are quite encouraging and will be useful as an effective method for coordination of over current relays.","doi":"10.1109/POWERCON.2010.5666600","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Power System Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/5645358/5666013/05666600.pdf","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Power System Technology","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/POWERCON.2010.5666600","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5666013","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new hybrid particle swarm optimization for optimal coordination of over current relay","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Gallium","Relays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["concave programming","genetic algorithms","nonlinear programming","overcurrent protection","particle swarm optimisation","relay protection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hybrid particle swarm optimization","directional overcurrent relay","DOCR coordination problem","nonconvex problem","linear programming","nonlinear programming","genetic algorithm","time setting multiplier","IMS","current setting","near-end fault","far-end fault"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Over current relay","hybrid PSO","linear programming","relay coordination"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Geoscience"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5666600/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 Oct. 2010","displayDocTitle":"A new hybrid particle swarm optimization for optimal coordination of over current relay","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5666600/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"13 December 2010","conferenceDate":"24-28 Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11700495","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new hybrid particle swarm optimization for optimal coordination of over current relay","confLoc":"Zhejiang, China","sourcePdf":"FP1332FF.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067244S","chronDate":"24-28 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5645358","isNumber":"5666013","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5645358","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"5666013","articleId":"5666600","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5666603,"authors":[{"name":"O.

The impacts on forecasting accuracy of input data, such as solar irradiance, air temperature, cloud, humidity and sun position, for these two models are presented. Best input data models are founded for these two methods. Finally, the comparison of performance of the two forecasting models is investigated by a case study of a 1MW PV station. The nRMSE over one month of these two models are very close, i.e. around 10%-13%. The impacts of seasons on forecasting performance are presented. Moreover, by comparison, we found that the main origin of forecasting errors comes from the accuracy of weather prediction information, NWP. Thus, future improvement of power forecasting methods mainly relies on improvement of weather forecast in short-term forecasting application. Furthermore, real-time measured irradiance data can be considered to modify the model input to further improve super-short-term forecasting performance.","doi":"10.1109/POWERCON.2010.5666688","pdfPath":"/iel5/5645358/5666013/05666688.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Power System Technology","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Power System Technology","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/POWERCON.2010.5666688","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5666013","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Comparative study of power forecasting methods for PV stations","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Geoscience"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5666688/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 Oct. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Comparative study of power forecasting methods for PV stations","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"13 December 2010","accessionNumber":"11700493","publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5666688/","conferenceDate":"24-28 Oct. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparative study of power forecasting methods for PV stations","confLoc":"Zhejiang, China","sourcePdf":"CP1105FF.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055058S","chronDate":"24-28 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5645358","isNumber":"5666013","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5645358","citationCount":"59","xplore-issue":"5666013","articleId":"5666688","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":5666772,"authors":[{"name":"Minqi Zhou","affiliation":["Software Engineering Institute, East China Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Minqi","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37592164100"},{"name":"Rong Zhang","affiliation":["National Institute of Information and Communications Technology, Kyoto, Japan"],"firstName":"Rong","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37592955100"},{"name":"Dadan Zeng","affiliation":["Software Engineering Institute, East China Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Dadan","lastName":"Zeng","id":"37587442400"},{"name":"Weining Qian","affiliation":["Software Engineering Institute, East China Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Weining","lastName":"Qian","id":"37416694800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7820-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7821-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-7819-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5666772","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":63,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":4037},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Services in the Cloud Computing era: A survey","abstract":"Cloud Computing is becoming a well-known buzzword nowadays.

Based on their overwhelming predominance in traditional service provisions and capital accumulation, most of these IT companies have more chance to adapt their services into such a new environment earlier, say Cloud Computing systems. On the other hand, a large number of new companies are spawned with competitive services relayed on those provided Cloud Computing systems. In terms of their provisions, we divide those services into six categories in this paper, say Data as a Service (Daas), Software as a Service (SaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), Identity and Policy Management as a Service (IPMaaS), Network as a Service (NaaS), Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS).

The FEC scheme uses serially concatenated Reed-Solomon (RS) codes with hard-decision decoding, using shortening and puncturing to vary the code rate. An inner repetition code with soft combining provides further rate variation. While suboptimal, repetition coding allows operation at very low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) with minimal increase in complexity. A rate adaptation algorithm uses the SNR or the FEC decoder input bit-error ratio (BER) estimated by a receiver to determine the combination of RS-RS and repetition codes that maximizes the information bit rate while satisfying a target FEC decoder output BER and providing a specified SNR margin. This FEC scheme is combined here with single-carrier polarization-multiplexed quadrature phase-shift keying (PM-QPSK) and digital coherent detection, achieving 100-Gbit/s peak information bit rate in a nominal 50-GHz channel bandwidth. We simulate variable-rate single-channel transmission through a long-haul system incorporating numerous optical switches, evaluating the impact of fiber nonlinearity and bandwidth narrowing. With zero SNR margin, achievable information bit rates vary from 100 Gbit/s at 2000 km, to about 60 Gbit/s at 3000 km, to about 35 Gbit/s at 4000 km. Compared to an ideal coding scheme achieving information-theoretic limits on an AWGN channel, the proposed coding scheme exhibits a performance gap ranging from about 5.9 dB at 2000 km to about 7.5 dB at 5000 km. Much of the increase in the gap arises from the inefficiency of the repetition coding used beyond 3280 km. Rate-adaptive transmission can extend reach when regeneration sites are not available, helping networks adapt to changing traffic demands. It is likely to become more important with the continued evolution toward optically switched mesh networks, which make signal quality more variable.","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2010.2099208","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/50/5680666/05667034.pdf","startPage":"222","endPage":"233","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2010.2099208","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5680666","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Rate-Adaptive Coding for Optical Fiber Transmission Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5667034","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 December 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.15,  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5667034/","displayDocTitle":"Rate-Adaptive Coding for Optical Fiber Transmission Systems","volume":"29","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Jan.15, 2011","accessionNumber":"11775743","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5667034/","dateOfInsertion":"28 January 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Rate-Adaptive Coding for Optical Fiber Transmission Systems","sourcePdf":"jlt-gho-2099208-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.117074S","chronDate":"Jan.15,  2011","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"5680666","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"46","xplore-issue":"5680666","articleId":"5667034","onlineDate":"13 December 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5667059,"authors":[{"name":"Keith A.

Fifteen feature parameters, associated with shape, position, orientation, brightness, contrast and line density are calculated for each candidate segment. Based on these features, each segment is categorized as normal or abnormal using a support vector machine (SVM) classifier. The system was trained and tested by cross-validation using 38 images with new vessels and 71 normal images from two diabetic retinal screening centers and one hospital eye clinic. The discrimination performance of the fifteen features was tested against a clinical reference standard. Fourteen features were found to be effective and used in the final test. The area under the receiver operator characteristic curve was 0.911 for detecting images with new vessels on the disc. This accuracy may be sufficient for it to play a useful clinical role in an automated retinopathy analysis system.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Detection of New Vessels on the Optic Disc Using Retinal Photographs","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","doi":"10.1109/TMI.2010.2099236","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","pdfPath":"/iel5/42/5741236/05667059.pdf","startPage":"972","endPage":"979","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMI.2010.2099236","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5741236","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5667059","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5667059/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 December 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2011","displayDocTitle":"Detection of New Vessels on the Optic Disc Using Retinal Photographs","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"30","issue":"4","dateOfInsertion":"05 April 2011","publicationDate":"April 2011","accessionNumber":"11909927","pubMedId":"21156389","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Detection of New Vessels on the Optic Disc Using Retinal Photographs","sourcePdf":"tmi-goatman-2099236-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.05047S","chronDate":"April  2011","isNumber":"5741236","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"42","citationCount":"74","articleId":"5667059","onlineDate":"13 December 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-02"},{"_id":5667061,"authors":[{"name":"Sunyeong Lee","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Kookmin University, Seoul, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7729/6011606/5667061/5667061-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Sunyeong Lee received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electrical engineering from Kookmin University, Seoul, Korea, in 2007 and 2010, respectively.","From September 2007 to August 2008, he was with the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of California, Berkeley, where he was involved in the characterization of multibit nitride-based charge trapping flash memory as well as the design and development of 3-D nanoscale FETs.

In frequency division duplexing, the transmitter typically learns about the channel conditions using a small amount of feedback (called limited feedback) sent on the reverse link. While feedback is well studied, there has been only limited work addressing how feedback techniques should be modified depending on the amount of mobility. This paper concerns a signaling scheme for limited feedback multiple antenna wireless communications taking the temporal correlation into account during feedback design. We refer to this as using an adaptive feedback period (AFP) scheme. In the AFP scheme, the transmitter and receiver reuse the past channel state information (CSI) as side information. Feedback to be used for several channel uses is sent from the receiver to the transmitter using a predetermined feedback update period. The feedback update period is determined by characterizing the temporal correlation statistic, so that the proposed AFP scheme outperforms the traditional limited feedback approach, which we refer to as the minimal feedback period (MFP) scheme. To measure the performance, the average effective SNR is considered. Bounds on the feedback update period, correlation coefficient, and feedback rate needed for the AFP scheme to outperform the MFP scheme are derived. Moreover, criteria to initiate the control of the feedback update period are obtained. Results on the average effective SNR are used to develop bounds on the feedback update period using the capacity loss. It is also shown that in the large system limit the feedback update periods required for both the average effective SNR and capacity loss converge to the same bound. These results verify that infrequent high resolution feedback is sometimes preferable to frequent low resolution feedback.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Does Frequent Low Resolution Feedback Outperform Infrequent High Resolution Feedback for Multiple Antenna Beamforming Systems?","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2010.2099222","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/5725269/05667063.pdf","startPage":"1654","endPage":"1669","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2010.2099222","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5725269","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5667063","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5667063/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 December 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2011","displayDocTitle":"Does Frequent Low Resolution Feedback Outperform Infrequent High Resolution Feedback for Multiple Antenna Beamforming Systems?","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"59","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/5667063/","dateOfInsertion":"07 March 2011","publicationDate":"April 2011","accessionNumber":"11851193","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Does Frequent Low Resolution Feedback Outperform Infrequent High Resolution Feedback for Multiple Antenna Beamforming Systems?","sourcePdf":"tsp-kim-2099222-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.109597S","chronDate":"April  2011","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"5725269","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"43","xplore-issue":"5725269","articleId":"5667063","onlineDate":"13 December 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5667064,"authors":[{"name":"Yu-Han Yang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Graduate Institute of Communication Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan","Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Maryland, College Park, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/5725269/5667064/5667064-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yu-Han Yang (S'06) received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering in 2004 and two M.S. degrees in computer science and communication engineering in 2007, from the National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan, R.O.C.

Each user is assigned multiple data streams and has multiple antennas at its receiver. Efficient solutions to the joint transmit-receive beamforming and power allocation problem based on iterative methods are proposed. We adopt the group maximum signal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio (SINR) filter bank (GSINR-FB) as our beamformer which exploits receiver diversity through cooperation between the data streams of a user. The data streams for each user are subject to an average SINR constraint, which has many important applications in wireless communication systems and serves as a good metric to measure the quality of service (QoS).

Based on the GSINR-FB beamformer, we find an SINR balancing structure for optimal power allocation which simplifies the complicated power allocation problem to a linear one.

We focus on the following architectural question: Is there a significant performance improvement when we allow such a message broadcast? We consider the error exponent (asymptotically, in the limit of a large number of sensors) for the Neyman-Pearson formulation of the detection problem.

We previously introduced an efficient algorithm for implementing an unconditionally stable 2-D Laguerre-based FDTD method. We numerically verified that the efficient algorithm can save CPU time and memory storage greatly while maintaining comparable computational accuracy. This paper presents new efficient algorithm for implementing unconditionally stable 3-D Laguerre-based FDTD method. To do so, a factorization-splitting scheme using two sub-steps is adopted to solve the produced huge sparse matrix equation. For a full update cycle, the presented scheme solves six tri-diagonal matrices for the electric field components and computes three explicit equations for the magnetic field components. A perfectly matched layer absorbing boundary condition is also extended to this approach. In order to demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method, numerical examples are given.","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.2010.2091206","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel5/22/5685336/05667070.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.2010.2091206","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5685336","startPage":"56","endPage":"64","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient Implementation for 3-D Laguerre-Based Finite-Difference Time-Domain Method","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5667070","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Efficient Implementation for 3-D Laguerre-Based Finite-Difference Time-Domain Method","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5667070/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 December 2010","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"59","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2011","accessionNumber":"11733599","dateOfInsertion":"10 January 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5667070/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient Implementation for 3-D Laguerre-Based Finite-Difference Time-Domain Method","sourcePdf":"tmtt-duan-2091206-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.094442S","chronDate":"Jan.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"5685336","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"33","xplore-issue":"5685336","articleId":"5667070","onlineDate":"13 December 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5667071,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaolei Liu","affiliation":["University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada"],"bio":{"p":["Xiaolei Liu (S'07) received the B.Sc. degree from the Qingdao University of Science and Technology, Qingdao, China, in 2005 and is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree at the University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada.","His interests include digital protection relaying, digital signal processing, neural networks, and HVDC systems."]},"firstName":"Xiaolei","lastName":"Liu","id":"37406533100"},{"name":"Ahmed H.

Signal integrity issues, such as inter-symbol interference (ISI) and crosstalk between the differential pair, however, still cause significant timing jitter and amplitude noise and heavily limit the performance of the differential link. The pre-emphasis filter is commonly used to reduce ISI but may potentially change the crosstalk behavior. In this paper, we first propose formula-based jitter and noise models considering the combined effect of ISI, crosstalk, and pre-emphasis filter. With the same set of input patterns, experiment shows our models achieve within 5% difference compared with SPICE simulation. By utilizing these formula-based models, we then develop algorithms to directly find out the input patterns for worst-case jitter and worst-case amplitude noise through pseudo-Boolean optimization (PBO) and mathematical programming. In addition, a heuristic algorithm is proposed to further reduce runtime. Experiments show our algorithms obtain more reliable worst-case jitter and noise compared with pseudorandom bit sequences simulation and, meanwhile, reduce runtime by 25\u00d7 when using a general PBO solver and by 150\u00d7 when using our proposed heuristic algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/TVLSI.2010.2090544","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVLSI.2010.2090544","startPage":"89","endPage":"97","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/92/6099858/05667076.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6099858","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Worst-Case Estimation for Data-Dependent Timing Jitter and Amplitude Noise in High-Speed Differential Link","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 December 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2012","displayDocTitle":"Worst-Case Estimation for Data-Dependent Timing Jitter and Amplitude Noise in High-Speed Differential Link","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2011","volume":"20","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5667076/","accessionNumber":"12409681","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5667076/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Worst-Case Estimation for Data-Dependent Timing Jitter and Amplitude Noise in High-Speed Differential Link","sourcePdf":"tvlsi-yao-2090544-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.083606S","chronDate":"Jan.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"6099858","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6099858","articleId":"5667076","onlineDate":"13 December 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5667109,"authors":[{"name":"Zhenglin Wang","affiliation":["School of Computer and Information Science, University of South Australia, Australia"],"firstName":"Zhenglin","lastName":"Wang","id":"37597976800"},{"name":"Ivan Lee","affiliation":["School of Computer and Information Science, University of South Australia, Australia"],"firstName":"Ivan","lastName":"Lee","id":"37279664200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9043-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4272-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5667109","dbTime":"20 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":458},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sensors","Image reconstruction","Recycling","Redundancy","Video sequences","Encoding","Video coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["motion estimation","video coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["video coding","compressive sensing measurements","video codec applications","low-complexity encoding procedure","inter-frame redundancy"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["compressive sensing","video codec","motion estimation"]}],"abstract":"Compressive Sensing (CS) is gaining popularity in video codec applications because of its low-complexity encoding procedure. However, traditional motion estimation is unable to be adopted to reduce the inter-frame redundancy in CS. Therefore, how to reduce the inter-frame redundancy is becoming the top priority for CS. In this article, similar redundancy is also discovered in excessive CS measurements via analyzing the relationship between the CS measurements and the original signal. Consequently, a proposed scheme is to conditionally reuse CS measurements to reduce the redundancy among CS measurements and increase video compression ratio. The experimental results show the proposed scheme can increase 20% compression rate. At the same time, the proposed scheme still maintains the low-complexity characteristic.","doi":"10.1109/UIC-ATC.2010.38","publicationTitle":"2010 7th International Conference on Ubiquitous Intelligence & Computing and 7th International Conference on Autonomic & Trusted Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 7th International Conference on Ubiquitous Intelligence & Computing and 7th International Conference on Autonomic & Trusted Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5666992/5667097/05667109.pdf","startPage":"64","endPage":"69","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/UIC-ATC.2010.38","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5667097","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Study of Video Coding by Reusing Compressive Sensing Measurements","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5667109","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 Oct. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5667109/","displayDocTitle":"A Study of Video Coding by Reusing Compressive Sensing Measurements","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11697311","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5667109/","conferenceDate":"26-29 Oct. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"13 December 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Study of Video Coding by Reusing Compressive Sensing Measurements","confLoc":"Xi'an, China","sourcePdf":"4272a064.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068664S","chronDate":"26-29 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5666992","isNumber":"5667097","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5666992","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5667097","articleId":"5667109","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5667162,"authors":[{"name":"Sheikh Mahbub Habib","affiliation":["Center for Advanced Security Research Darmstadt(CASED), Technische Universit\u00e4t Darmstadt, Germany"],"firstName":"Sheikh Mahbub","lastName":"Habib","id":"37594215300"},{"name":"Sebastian Ries","affiliation":["Center for Advanced Security Research Darmstadt(CASED), Technische Universit\u00e4t Darmstadt, Germany"],"firstName":"Sebastian","lastName":"Ries","id":"37585829400"},{"name":"Max Muhlhauser","affiliation":["Center for Advanced Security Research Darmstadt(CASED), Technische Universit\u00e4t Darmstadt, Germany"],"firstName":"Max","lastName":"Muhlhauser","id":"37328724600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9043-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4272-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5667162","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":66,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":2028},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cloud Computing Landscape and Research Challenges Regarding Trust and Reputation","abstract":"Cloud Computing is an emerging computing paradigm.

Since conventional MOSFETs are already operating in the sub-100 nm range, new physical effects and principles begin to determine the transport characteristics and the validity of conventional current transport models is in question. The classical drift-diffusion model of carrier transport in electronic devices has been widely employed in TCAD tools. However, it must be generalized to include hot-carrier effects. This motivated the development of higher-order moments transport models such as the hydrodynamic transport model, the energy transport model, and the six-moments model. With scaling continuing quantum mechanical effects begin to affect the transport properties. Parallel to the search for new technological solutions for MOSFET scaling, the development of conceptually new devices and architectures is becoming increasingly important. New nanoelectronic structures, such as carbon nanotubes, nanowires, and even molecules, are considered to be prominent candidates for the post-CMOS era. At this small device size the geometrical spread of the carrier wave packet in transport direction can no longer be ignored. When the device size becomes shorter than the coherence length, the complete information about the carrier dynamics inside the device including the phase of the wave function is needed and one has to resort to a full quantum mechanical description including scattering. Transport in advanced nanodevices is determined by the interplay between coherent propagation and scattering. Numerical methods for dissipative quantum transport based on the non-equilibrium Green's function formalism, the Liouville/von-Neumann equation for the density matrix, and the kinetic equation for the Wigner function are attaining relevance. In this work we review semi-classical and quantum mechanical modeling of carrier transport in nanoscale semiconductor devices.","doi":"10.1109/ICSICT.2010.5667336","pdfPath":"/iel5/5658734/5667273/05667336.pdf","startPage":"1737","endPage":"1740","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 10th IEEE International Conference on Solid-State and Integrated Circuit Technology","publicationTitle":"2010 10th IEEE International Conference on Solid-State and Integrated Circuit Technology","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSICT.2010.5667336","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5667273","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Transport modeling for nanoscale semiconductor devices","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5667336/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-4 Nov. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Transport modeling for nanoscale semiconductor devices","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"13 December 2010","accessionNumber":"11697120","publicationDate":"Nov. 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5667336/","conferenceDate":"1-4 Nov. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Transport modeling for nanoscale semiconductor devices","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"542I1404.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.148732S","chronDate":"1-4 Nov. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5658734","isNumber":"5667273","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5658734","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"5667273","articleId":"5667336","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5667337,"authors":[{"name":"Chaoli Zhong","affiliation":["Beijing Embedded System Key Laboratory, Beijing University of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Chaoli","lastName":"Zhong","id":"37586056300"},{"name":"Di Zhu","affiliation":["Beijing Embedded System Key Laboratory, Beijing University of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Di","lastName":"Zhu","id":"37591905700"},{"name":"Guanzhong Huang","affiliation":["Beijing Embedded System Key Laboratory, Beijing University of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Guanzhong","lastName":"Huang","id":"37592801700"},{"name":"Peiyuan Wan","affiliation":["Beijing Embedded System Key Laboratory, Beijing University of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Peiyuan","lastName":"Wan","id":"37593432600"},{"name":"Ping Lin","affiliation":["Beijing Embedded System Key Laboratory, Beijing University of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Ping","lastName":"Lin","id":"37597162500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5798-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5797-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5800-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5667337","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":606},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5667337","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Electronics packaging","Band pass filters","Resistors","Gain","Transceivers","Power line communications","Bandwidth"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplifiers","carrier transmission on power lines","CMOS integrated circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["programmable gain amplifier","DC-offset cancellation","power line communication","speed-enhanced method","low-noisy method","current-mode feedback","master-slave configuration","CMOS technology","size 0.18 mum"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents an improved DC-offset cancellation (DCOC) circuit for programmable-gain amplifier (PGA) in power line communication.

This PA achieves saturation power of 18.3 dBm and peak PAE of 24.3% at 60 GHz in simulation.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5667377/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-4 Nov. 2010","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"1-4 Nov. 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5667377/","dateOfInsertion":"13 December 2010","publicationDate":"Nov. 2010","accessionNumber":"11697160","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A high efficiency 60GHz power amplifier in 90nm CMOS","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A high efficiency 60GHz power amplifier in 90nm CMOS","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"222O0317.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039221S","chronDate":"1-4 Nov. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5658734","isNumber":"5667273","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5658734","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5667273","articleId":"5667377","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-17"},{"_id":5667390,"authors":[{"name":"Wenlong Yang","affiliation":["Department of Microelectronics, Fudan University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Wenlong","lastName":"Yang","id":"37595458400"},{"name":"Lingli Wang","affiliation":["Department of Microelectronics, Fudan University, Shanghai, China"],"lastName":"Lingli Wang","id":"37600175900"},{"name":"Xuegong Zhou","affiliation":["Department of Microelectronics, Fudan University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Xuegong","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37559473400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5798-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5797-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5800-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5667390","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":261},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5667390","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Random access memory","Read only memory","Error correction codes","Single event upset","Tunneling magnetoresistance","Error analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","SRAM chips"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CRC circuit design","SRAM-based FPGA configuration bit correction","field programmable gate arrays","single event upset","configuration memory","catastrophic consequence","SEU mitigation"]}],"abstract":"Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) are used in a variety of applications. However, the SRAM-based FPGAs can be easily influenced by single event upset (SEU) in the configuration memory. SEU could lead to a series of catastrophic consequence ranging from unwanted functional, data loss, or failure of the whole systems. So it's very important to find a way to mitigating the SEU effect. In this paper, the existing techniques for SEU mitigation are introduced, and their shortcomings are pointed out. A new mitigation algorithm is proposed. Experimental results indicate that our algorithm is both feasible and effective.","publicationTitle":"2010 10th IEEE International Conference on Solid-State and Integrated Circuit Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 10th IEEE International Conference on Solid-State and Integrated Circuit Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/5658734/5667273/05667390.pdf","startPage":"1660","endPage":"1664","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSICT.2010.5667390","doi":"10.1109/ICSICT.2010.5667390","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5667273","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"CRC circuit design for SRAM-Based FPGA configuration bit correction","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"CRC circuit design for SRAM-Based FPGA configuration bit correction","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5667390/","conferenceDate":"1-4 Nov. 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5667390/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"13 December 2010","publicationDate":"Nov. 2010","accessionNumber":"11697173","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-4 Nov. 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"CRC circuit design for SRAM-Based FPGA configuration bit correction","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"518P1303.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049456S","chronDate":"1-4 Nov. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5658734","isNumber":"5667273","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5658734","xplore-issue":"5667273","articleId":"5667390","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5667404,"authors":[{"name":"Shilei Hao","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of ASIC and Systems, Fudan University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Shilei","lastName":"Hao","id":"37591278500"},{"name":"Jian Fu","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of ASIC and Systems, Fudan University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Jian","lastName":"Fu","id":"37595790600"},{"name":"Yumei Huang","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of ASIC and Systems, Fudan University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Yumei","lastName":"Huang","id":"37291620100"},{"name":"Zhiliang Hong","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of ASIC and Systems, Fudan University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Zhiliang","lastName":"Hong","id":"37276342300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5798-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5797-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5800-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5667404","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":576},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Gain","Noise","Noise measurement","Frequency measurement","CMOS integrated circuits","Impedance matching","Receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS integrated circuits","code division multiple access","differential amplifiers","low noise amplifiers","radio receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high linearity variable gain LNA","WCDMA receiver front-end","low noise amplifier","power constrained simultaneous noise and input matching technique","capacitive divider","current steering technique","SMIC CMOS technology","differential amplifier","size 0.13 mum","noise figure 2.65 dB","gain 15.9 dB","current 8 mA","voltage 1.5 V"]}],"abstract":"A high linearity variable gain low noise amplifier (VGLNA) used for WCDMA receiver is presented.

A common material in fabricating memristors is titanium oxide. The growth of titanium oxide has so far been focused on atomic layer deposition or sputtering, which is expensive.

Both the high and low resistance states of the device can be continually modulated by the successive voltage sweeps. Moreover, multilevel storage can be achieved in the device by using various maximum voltages during the set process.","publicationTitle":"2010 10th IEEE International Conference on Solid-State and Integrated Circuit Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 10th IEEE International Conference on Solid-State and Integrated Circuit Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/5658734/5667273/05667581.pdf","startPage":"1148","endPage":"1150","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A low-cost memristor based on titanium oxide","doi":"10.1109/ICSICT.2010.5667581","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5667273","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSICT.2010.5667581","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5667581","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5667581/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-4 Nov. 2010","displayDocTitle":"A low-cost memristor based on titanium oxide","dateOfInsertion":"13 December 2010","publicationDate":"Nov. 2010","accessionNumber":"11696894","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"1-4 Nov. 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5667581/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A low-cost memristor based on titanium oxide","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"362P0710.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048226S","chronDate":"1-4 Nov. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5658734","isNumber":"5667273","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5658734","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"5667273","articleId":"5667581","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5667582,"authors":[{"name":"Sheng Yang","affiliation":["ASIC and System State Key Lab, Department of Microelectronics, Fudan University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Sheng","lastName":"Yang","id":"37598418200"},{"name":"Yiting Wang","affiliation":["ASIC and System State Key Lab, Department of Microelectronics, Fudan University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Yiting","lastName":"Wang","id":"37601131000"},{"name":"Xiangyu Zeng","affiliation":["ASIC and System State Key Lab, Department of Microelectronics, Fudan University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Xiangyu","lastName":"Zeng","id":"37306269900"},{"name":"Jia Zhou","affiliation":["ASIC and System State Key Lab, Department of Microelectronics, Fudan University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Jia","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37291310900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5798-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5797-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5800-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5667582","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":226},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Zinc oxide","Surface treatment","Surface topography","Microfluidics","Films","Surface impedance","Surface roughness"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["contact angle","electrochemistry","hydrophobicity","II-VI semiconductors","microfabrication","microfluidics","water","wide band gap semiconductors","zinc compounds"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["microfluidic devices","superhydrophobic ZnO film","electrochemical deposition","superhydrophobic ZnO surface","contact angle","water","teflon 1600 modification","ZnO"]}],"abstract":"A simple method of electrochemical deposition was adopted to fabricate super-hydrophobic ZnO surface.

The devices show reproducible nonpolar resistive switching. The formation and annihilation of localized conductive filaments is suggested to be responsible for the resistive switching characteristics according to a series of convincing evidences. Temperature-dependent resistive switching behaviors show that a metallic conductive channel is responsible for the low resistance state. Further analysis reveals that the physical origin of this metallic channel is the nanoscale Cu conductive filament. The metal filaments are observed by TEM and the component is also confirmed.

Moreover, to reduce the precharge/active frequency during SDRAM accessing, a command-reordering method is adopted to achieve 60% reduction in average.

This paper proposes a novel implementation of a 300MHz direct digital frequency based on modified CORDIC in 0.35\u03bcm CMOS technology.

In this paper, an improved redundant method is employed and the rotation directions can be predicted directly from the binary values of the initial input angle. This method allows the parallel CORDIC to making a much faster implementation possible. At the same time, pipelined accumulator and carry-save arithmetic are employed to achieve the maximum speed. The DDFS is fabricated in 0.35um N-well 2P3M CMOS process, occupied an area of 3.2\u00d73.6mm2.

The network consists of IAF neurons and weight adaption circuit which represents the interaction between neurons. The IAF neurons exhibit the electrochemical dynamics of natural biological neurons. According to achieve the adaption of both weights between two neurons, the weight adaption circuit can adjust the frequency and phase of the pulse stream generated by the neurons. Then the network can implemented for image segmentation. The HSPICE simulation results show that the frequency and phase of the pulse stream generated by the neurons with similar inputs are able to be synchronized, which indicates that this network may provide substantial advantages for image segmentation.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-4 Nov. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5667747/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11696719","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5667747/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"13 December 2010","conferenceDate":"1-4 Nov. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"An analog CMOS pulse coupled neural network for image segmentation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An analog CMOS pulse coupled neural network for image segmentation","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"586P1415.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067431S","chronDate":"1-4 Nov. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5658734","isNumber":"5667273","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5658734","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5667273","articleId":"5667747","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5667749,"authors":[{"name":"Zili Yu","affiliation":["Electronic Instrumentation Laboratory, Delft University of Technnology, Delft, Netherlands"],"firstName":"Zili","lastName":"Yu","id":"37402462400"},{"name":"Michiel A.P.

The proposed ADC is realized by using two-step conversion scheme: the voltage-to-time conversion (VTC) and the digital-to-time conversion (TDC). In VTC, the classic Wilkinson-type architecture are adopted. Both the high-precise ramp generator and the high-resolution high-speed comparator are presented. In TDC, counter-based circuits and the time interpolation based on a digital delay-locked loop (DLL) are proposed. A eight-channel prototype has been designed in AMS 0.35 #m technology. The typical resolution of the ADC is 12 bits. The typical sampling rate is about 1 Msample/s while the clock is 100 MHz. The power dissipation is 3 mW + 0.8 mW/channel.

With technology scaling to the nanometer, the device mismatch increases and the distribution effect induces unstable signal injection, thus affecting the reliability of memory system.

This paper proposes a distributed compressive spectrum sensing scheme, in which the modulated wide-band converter can apply compressed sensing (CS) directly to analog signals at the sub-Nyquist rate and the central fusion receives signals from multiple CRs and exploits the multiple-measurements-vectors (MMV) subspace pursuit (M-SP) algorithm to jointly reconstruct the spectral support of the wide-band signal. This support is then used to detect whether the licensed bands are occupy or not. Finally, extensive simulation results show the advantages of the proposed scheme. Besides, we also compare the performance of M-SP with M-orthogonal matching pursuit (M-OMP) algorithms.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel and efficient mixed-signal compressed sensing for wide-band cognitive radio","publicationTitle":"International Forum on Strategic Technology 2010","doi":"10.1109/IFOST.2010.5668104","displayPublicationTitle":"International Forum on Strategic Technology 2010","pdfPath":"/iel5/5647051/5667899/05668104.pdf","startPage":"27","endPage":"32","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IFOST.2010.5668104","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5667899","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5668104","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5668104/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 Oct. 2010","displayDocTitle":"A novel and efficient mixed-signal compressed sensing for wide-band cognitive radio","conferenceDate":"13-15 Oct. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5668104/","dateOfInsertion":"13 December 2010","publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11697486","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel and efficient mixed-signal compressed sensing for wide-band cognitive radio","confLoc":"Ulsan, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"3309.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.105335S","chronDate":"13-15 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5647051","isNumber":"5667899","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5647051","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5667899","articleId":"5668104","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5668105,"authors":[{"name":"Ha Nguyen Vu","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, University of Ulsan, Ulsan, South Korea"],"lastName":"Ha Nguyen Vu","id":"38241501000"},{"name":"Hyung Yun Kong","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, University of Ulsan, Ulsan, South Korea"],"lastName":"Hyung Yun Kong","id":"37289512100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9038-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-9036-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5668105","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":170},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Artificial neural networks","Signal to noise ratio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","cooperative communication","Monte Carlo methods","spread spectrum communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["overlap cooperative spectrum sensing","cognitive radio network","cooperation multiple secondary user","cognitive radio user","Monte Carlo simulation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cognitive radio","spectrum sensing","energy detection","Energy comparing with timer"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Overlap cooperative spectrum sensing with energy comparing in cognitive radio networks","doi":"10.1109/IFOST.2010.5668105","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5667899","endPage":"235","publicationTitle":"International Forum on Strategic Technology 2010","displayPublicationTitle":"International Forum on Strategic Technology 2010","pdfPath":"/iel5/5647051/5667899/05668105.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IFOST.2010.5668105","startPage":"230","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5668105","abstract":"In cognitive radio network, cooperation multiple secondary users can improve the performance of spectrum sensing. However, the sensing process duration is generally increasing because the number of the local decisions needing to be sent to the fusion center. Most alternative works consider a general time frame structure in which all the cognitive radio users (CRs) sense the signal in the same time and then each user must waits for its turn to report its observation. Hence, there is a waste of the time here and this time consumed by waiting can contribute little to the performance of spectrum sensing. In this paper, we propose an overlap spectrum sensing, the CRs keep collecting and fusing the signal while another is reporting to FC. By making use of the waiting time for sensing, the new framework provides a much wider observing window for spectrum measurement, which results in a performance improvement of spectrum sensing. Besides, we also apply the energy comparing to choose the good CR to send its local decision in each reporting time slot. The sensing performances of this sensing strategy are analyzed and confirmed by the Monte-Carlo simulation results.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5668105/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 Oct. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"13 December 2010","accessionNumber":"11697487","htmlLink":"/document/5668105/","conferenceDate":"13-15 Oct. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Overlap cooperative spectrum sensing with energy comparing in cognitive radio networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Overlap cooperative spectrum sensing with energy comparing in cognitive radio networks","confLoc":"Ulsan, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"3310.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052853S","chronDate":"13-15 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5647051","isNumber":"5667899","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5647051","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5667899","articleId":"5668105","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5668238,"authors":[{"name":"Roozbeh Yaghoobi","affiliation":["Department of Industrial Engineering, Islamic Azad University, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Roozbeh","lastName":"Yaghoobi","id":"37589453600"},{"name":"Mir B.

In this paper, a reentrant scheduling problem is considered as a practical problem which has been addressed by our previous works. MCTS introduced by Coulom is a best-first search where the pseudorandom simulations guide the solution of problem. Recent improvements on MCTS have produced strong computer Go program, which has a large search space, and the success is a hot topic for selecting the best move. So far, most of reports about MCTS have been on two-player game, and MCTS has been applied rarely in one-player perfect-information games. MCTS does not need an admissible heuristic, so the application of MCTS for one-player games might be an interesting alternative. Additionally, one-player games like puzzles are determinately operated only by one player's decision, so sequences of changes in state are describable as a network diagram of interdependence of operations. Therefore if MCTS for one-player games is considered as a meta-heuristic algorithm, we can use this algorithm for not only many practical problems, but also combinatorial optimization problems. Especially as MCTS does not fully depend on evaluation function, so the solutions based on MCTS remain effective if objective function of problem is modified. This paper firstly investigated on the application of Single Player MCTS (SP-MCTS) introduced by Schadd et al. Next this paper showed the effectiveness of new simulation strategies on SP-MCTS by numerical experiments. Based on the results, this paper discussed the application potentiality of SP-MCTS for a practical reentrant scheduling problem.","pdfPath":"/iel5/5658183/5668158/05668320.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"The 40th International Conference on Computers & Indutrial Engineering","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5668158","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCIE.2010.5668320","doi":"10.1109/ICCIE.2010.5668320","displayPublicationTitle":"The 40th International Conference on Computers & Indutrial Engineering","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5668320","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Proposals"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer games","decision theory","game theory","Monte Carlo methods","network theory (graphs)","optimisation","printing","scheduling","tree searching"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["reentrant scheduling problem","best-first search","pseudorandom simulation","computer Go program","search space","two-player game","one-player perfect-information games","puzzles","one player decision","network diagram","meta-heuristic algorithm","combinatorial optimization problem","single player Monte-Carlo tree search","printing process"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 July 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5668320/","displayDocTitle":"Monte-Carlo Tree Search for a reentrant scheduling problem","accessionNumber":"11696506","dateOfInsertion":"13 December 2010","publicationDate":"July 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5668320/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"25-28 July 2010","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Monte-Carlo Tree Search for a reentrant scheduling problem","confLoc":"Awaji, Japan","sourcePdf":"cie125jp1.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059756S","chronDate":"25-28 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5658183","isNumber":"5668158","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5658183","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5668158","articleId":"5668320","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5668346,"authors":[{"name":"Zhili Zhou","affiliation":["School of Management, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Zhili","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37597258900"},{"name":"Yan Zhang","affiliation":["School of Management, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Yan","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37089082632"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7297-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7295-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-7296-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5668346","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":63},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5668346","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Printing","Biological cells","Job shop scheduling","Approximation algorithms","Approximation methods","Assembly"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","invoicing","scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiobjective hybrid genetic algorithm","invoice printing scheduling problem","multiobjective order scheduling problem","multipage invoice printing system","printing lines","multipage invoices","minimization","average flowtime","maximum tardiness","invoice orders"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["order scheduling problem","multi-objective optimization","genetic algorithm"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICCIE.2010.5668346","pdfPath":"/iel5/5658183/5668158/05668346.pdf","publicationTitle":"The 40th International Conference on Computers & Indutrial Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"The 40th International Conference on Computers & Indutrial Engineering","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5668158","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCIE.2010.5668346","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A multi-objective hybrid genetic algorithm for solving invoice printing scheduling problem","abstract":"This paper considers a multi-objective order scheduling problem in a multi-page invoice printing system which contains four main stages.

The optimal maintenance periods for all components in the system are determined efficiently. The proposed IPSO considers maintainable properties of a seriesparallel system. The importance measure of components is utilized to evaluate the effects of components on system reliability when maintaining a component. Furthermore, an adjustment mechanism is developed to deal with the problem in which particles move into an infeasible area. A replacement mechanism is implemented that replaces the first n particles ranked in descending order of total maintenance cost with randomly generated particles in the feasible area. The purpose of doing so is to overcome the weakness in that a typical PSO is easily trapped in local solutions when optimizing a complex problem. Additionally, this study employs response surface methodology (RSM) via systematic parameters experiments to determine the optimal settings of IPSO parameters. Finally, a case demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed IPSO.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 July 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5668350/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11696536","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5668350/","publicationDate":"July 2010","dateOfInsertion":"13 December 2010","conferenceDate":"25-28 July 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Optimizing minimize periodic preventive maintenance model for series-parallel systems based on particle swarm optimization","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimizing minimize periodic preventive maintenance model for series-parallel systems based on particle swarm optimization","confLoc":"Awaji, Japan","sourcePdf":"cie084tw1.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061877S","chronDate":"25-28 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5658183","isNumber":"5668158","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5658183","xplore-issue":"5668158","articleId":"5668350","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5668353,"authors":[{"name":"Kwei-Long Huang","affiliation":["Institute of Industrial Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Kwei-Long","lastName":"Huang","id":"37086012828"},{"name":"Bang-Woei Hung","affiliation":["Institute of Industrial Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Bang-Woei","lastName":"Hung","id":"37588432600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7297-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7295-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-7296-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5668353","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":104},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5668353","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Biological cells","Machining","Job shop scheduling","Robots","Loading","Algorithm design and analysis","Heuristic algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","machine shops","materials handling","scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hybrid genetic algorithm","flowshop scheduling","synchronous material movement","automated machining center","loading/unloading station","rotary table"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["hybrid genetic algorithm","flowshop scheduling","meta-heuristics","material handling"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICCIE.2010.5668353","pdfPath":"/iel5/5658183/5668158/05668353.pdf","publicationTitle":"The 40th International Conference on Computers & Indutrial Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"The 40th International Conference on Computers & Indutrial Engineering","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5668158","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCIE.2010.5668353","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hybrid genetic algorithms for flowshop scheduling with synchronous material movement","abstract":"This paper considers a flowshop scheduling problem with synchronous material movement in an automated machining center. This automated machining center consists of a loading/unloading (L/U) station, m processing machines, and a rotary table. The L/U station and the processing machines surround the rotary table which transports jobs between machines. The table rotates to simultaneously move jobs when all machines finish with their jobs, including the loading and unloading operations at the L/U station. The cycle time of each rotation is determined by the longest operation on machines. Finding an optimal sequence which minimizes its makespan in this type of machining centers has been shown to be strongly NP-hard. A genetic algorithm combined with a local search is proposed to solve the problem in a large scale. For a given sequence, the local search is applied to the cycle with the largest deviation of completion times. A numerical result shows that the proposed algorithm finds a better solution against other algorithms such as Tabu search, a particle swarm optimization algorithm, and genetic algorithms.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 July 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5668353/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11696538","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5668353/","publicationDate":"July 2010","dateOfInsertion":"13 December 2010","conferenceDate":"25-28 July 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Hybrid genetic algorithms for flowshop scheduling with synchronous material movement","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hybrid genetic algorithms for flowshop scheduling with synchronous material movement","confLoc":"Awaji, Japan","sourcePdf":"cie082tw1.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060155S","chronDate":"25-28 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5658183","isNumber":"5668158","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5658183","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5668158","articleId":"5668353","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":5668363,"authors":[{"name":"Iraj Mahdavi","affiliation":["Department of Industrial Engineering, Mazandaran University of Science and Technology, Babol, Iran"],"firstName":"Iraj","lastName":"Mahdavi","id":"37593806200"},{"name":"Mohsen Arabmaghsudi","affiliation":["Department of Industrial Engineering, Mazandaran University of Science and Technology, Babol, Iran"],"firstName":"Mohsen","lastName":"Arabmaghsudi","id":"38278087700"},{"name":"Farzin Taghipourian","affiliation":["Mazandaran Gas Company, Sari, Iran"],"firstName":"Farzin","lastName":"Taghipourian","id":"37591155000"},{"name":"Amir Mohajeri","affiliation":["Mazandaran Gas Company, Sari, Iran"],"firstName":"Amir","lastName":"Mohajeri","id":"37593469800"},{"name":"M.

Researchers have developed a wide variety of procedures and heuristics for solving these scheduling problems, called rescheduling. Most proposed approaches are often derived by making simplifying assumptions. As a consequence, the approach is not in accordance with functioning of the real manufacturing system. Such approaches are frequently not suitable and flexible enough to respond efficiently to fast changes in the environment. In this paper, we focus on a practical solution of rescheduling by using mathematical modeling and interactive adaptive-weight evolutionary algorithm. We extend the rescheduling problem to a multi-objective optimization model. We formulate several objectives for corresponding requirement, such as due date, capability, transportation cost, set up cost and available resources etc. We can select the necessary one objective or some objectives for the manufacturing flexibility. However, for traditional approaches of multi-objective optimization problems, researchers focused on the solutions diversity. For the multi-objective rescheduling problem (moJSRS), we have to consider not only the solutions diversity, but also adapting the objectives alternative. We will propose an interactive adaptive-weight evolutionary algorithm with adapting the characteristics of a multi-objective job shop rescheduling problem. Some practical test instances will be demonstrated the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed algorithm.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 July 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5668422/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11696605","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5668422/","publicationDate":"July 2010","dateOfInsertion":"13 December 2010","conferenceDate":"25-28 July 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Job shop rescheduling by using multi-objective genetic algorithm","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Job shop rescheduling by using multi-objective genetic algorithm","confLoc":"Awaji, Japan","sourcePdf":"OrgSsn132.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05739S","chronDate":"25-28 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5658183","isNumber":"5668158","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5658183","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5668158","articleId":"5668422","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5668477,"authors":[{"name":"Krishna Balachandran","affiliation":["Bell Laboratories, Alcatel-Lucent, Murray Hill, NJ, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/5711712/5668477/5668477-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Krishna Balachandran is the Director of Wireless Technologies and Systems Research in Bell Labs, Alcatel-Lucent, Murray Hill, NJ.

It has been observed that on the uplink, significant improvements in interference rejection can be attained by exchanging complex-valued received signal samples across a cluster of cells and employing joint multi-antenna receiver processing. However, such processing incurs substantial increases in backhaul overhead, exceeding the actual information delivered by at least an order of magnitude. In this paper, we propose and describe a signal processing approach based on a novel Network Interference Cancellation Engine (NICE), which opportunistically cancels out-of-cell interference by exchanging decoded dominant interferer data among cooperating cells and reconstructing interfering signals. Simulation results with NICE processing in cellular networks show that substantial improvements (5-7 dB) in signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio may be achieved over current non-cooperative multi-antenna receiver processing techniques while allowing backhaul overhead to be reduced by factors on the order of 40 to 50 relative to joint processing techniques employing the exchange of complex-valued received signal samples.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2010.120610.100169","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2010.120610.100169","startPage":"540","endPage":"549","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/5711712/05668477.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5711712","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"NICE: A Network Interference Cancellation Engine for Opportunistic Uplink Cooperation in Wireless Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 December 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"February  2011","displayDocTitle":"NICE: A Network Interference Cancellation Engine for Opportunistic Uplink Cooperation in Wireless Networks","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"February 2011","dateOfInsertion":"10 February 2011","volume":"10","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5668477/","accessionNumber":"11805090","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5668477/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"NICE: A Network Interference Cancellation Engine for Opportunistic Uplink Cooperation in Wireless Networks","sourcePdf":"540-tw1102-balachandran.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.05574S","chronDate":"February  2011","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"5711712","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"41","xplore-issue":"5711712","articleId":"5668477","onlineDate":"13 December 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5668481,"authors":[{"name":"Chee Yen Leow","affiliation":["Department of Electrical & Electronic Engineering, Imperial College London, UK","Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Universiti Teknologi Malaysia, Malaysia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/5711712/5668481/5668481-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Chee Yen Leow obtained his B.

In this paper, we investigate cognitive transmissions with multiple relays by jointly considering the two phases over Rayleigh fading channels. We study a selective fusion spectrum sensing and best relay data transmission (SFSS-BRDT) scheme in multiple-relay cognitive radio networks. Specifically, in the spectrum sensing phase, only the initial spectrum sensing results, which are received from the cognitive relays and decoded correctly at a cognitive source, are selected and used for fusion. In the data transmission phase, only the best relay is utilized to assist the cognitive source for data transmissions. Under the constraint of satisfying a required probability of false alarm of spectrum holes (for the protection of the primary user), we derive an exact closed-form expression of the spectrum hole utilization efficiency for the SFSS-BRDT scheme, which is used as a measure to quantify the percentage of spectrum holes utilized by the cognitive source for its successful data transmissions. For the comparison purpose, we also examine the spectrum hole utilization efficiency for a fixed fusion spectrum sensing and best relay data transmission (FFSS-BRDT) scheme, where all the initial spectrum sensing results are used for fusion without any refined selection. Numerical results show that, under a target probability of false alarm of spectrum holes, the SFSS-BRDT scheme outperforms the FFSS-BRDT scheme in terms of the spectrum hole utilization efficiency. Moreover, the spectrum hole utilization efficiency of the SFSS-BRDT scheme always improves as the number of cognitive relays increases, whereas the FFSS-BRDT scheme's performance improves initially and degrades eventually after a critical number of cognitive relays. It is also shown that a maximum spectrum hole utilization efficiency can be achieved through an optimal allocation of the time durations between the spectrum sensing and data transmission phases for both the FFSS-BRDT and SFSS-BRDT schemes.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cognitive Transmissions with Multiple Relays in Cognitive Radio Networks","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2010.120610.100830","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/5711712/05668484.pdf","startPage":"648","endPage":"659","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2010.120610.100830","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5711712","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5668484","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5668484/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 December 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"February  2011","displayDocTitle":"Cognitive Transmissions with Multiple Relays in Cognitive Radio Networks","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"10","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/5668484/","dateOfInsertion":"10 February 2011","publicationDate":"February 2011","accessionNumber":"11805097","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cognitive Transmissions with Multiple Relays in Cognitive Radio Networks","sourcePdf":"648-tw1102-zou.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.065517S","chronDate":"February  2011","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"5711712","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"98","xplore-issue":"5711712","articleId":"5668484","onlineDate":"13 December 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5668488,"authors":[{"name":"Nelson J.

Both TDM and WDM based polarization control schemes are analyzed. It is shown that TDM presents some important advantages when compared with the WDM control scheme. In WDM, the polarization decorrelation between the reference and data signals is an intrinsic and very limitative impairment. This effect has a contribution to quantum BER that increases with the propagation distance, and is highly dependent on the fiber polarization mode dispersion. In the TDM control scheme, the polarization decorrelation is less critical and other issues, like the single photon detector and feedback polarization control system performance tend to dominate. We show that for long distances the fiber losses represent the main contribution to the total quantum BER.

We apply two approaches to the wireless channel modeling: Saleh and Valenzuela (S-V) method for UWB channel modeling and CLEAN method for narrowband and UWB channel modeling. We validated that UWB echo signals (within a burst) do not hold self-similarity, which means the future signals cannot be forecasted based on the received signals and channel modeling is necessary from statistical point of view. Based on the S-V method for UWB channel modeling, in foliage UWB channel, the multipath contributions arriving at the receiver are grouped into clusters. The time of arrival of clusters can be modeled as a Poisson arrival process, while within each cluster, subsequent multipath contributions or rays also arrive according to a Poisson process. At different distance (near distance, medium distance, and far distance), we observe that the Poisson process parameters are quite different. We also observe that the amplitude of channel coefficient at each path follows Rician distribution for medium and far distance, and it is non-stationary for paths from short distance (one of two Rician distributions), and these observations are quite different with the IEEE indoor UWB channel model and S-V indoor channel model. Based on the CLEAN method, the narrowband (200 and 400 MHz) and UWB channel impulse responses have many similarities: both can be modeled as linear time-variant filter channel. We also studied the large-scale fading using path-loss and log-normal shadowing model for foliage enviroment, and observed that the path-loss exponent is very high because it has rich scattering.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5668491/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 December 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"11","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","dateOfInsertion":"19 April 2011","accessionNumber":"11960619","htmlLink":"/document/5668491/","displayDocTitle":"Radar Sensor Wireless Channel Modeling in Foliage Environment: UWB Versus Narrowband","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Radar Sensor Wireless Channel Modeling in Foliage Environment: UWB Versus Narrowband","sourcePdf":"jsen-liang-2097586-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.08056S","chronDate":"June  2011","xplore-pub-id":"7361","isNumber":"5752398","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7361","citationCount":"63","xplore-issue":"5752398","articleId":"5668491","onlineDate":"17 December 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5668502,"authors":[{"name":"Yasser Abdel-Rady I.

A direct-load control algorithm is presented to aggregate the water heater load for the purpose of regulation. A dual-element electric water heater model is developed, which accounts for both thermal dynamics and users' water consumption. A realistic regulation signal was used to evaluate the number of water heaters needed and the operational characteristics of a water heater when providing 2-MW regulation service. Modeling results suggest that approximately 33 000 water heaters are needed to provide a 2-MW regulation service 24 hours a day. However, if water heaters only provide regulation from 6:00 to 24:00, approximately 20 000 will be needed. Because the control algorithm has considered the thermal setting of the water heater, customer comfort is maintained. Therefore, the aggregated regulation service provided by water heater loads can become a major source of revenue for load-serving entities when the smart grid enables the direct load control.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Evaluation of the Water Heater Load Potential for Providing Regulation Service","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","doi":"10.1109/TPWRS.2010.2090909","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/59/5958775/05668519.pdf","startPage":"1309","endPage":"1316","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRS.2010.2090909","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5958775","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5668519","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5668519/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 December 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2011","displayDocTitle":"An Evaluation of the Water Heater Load Potential for Providing Regulation Service","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"26","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/5668519/","dateOfInsertion":"22 July 2011","publicationDate":"Aug. 2011","accessionNumber":"12175110","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Evaluation of the Water Heater Load Potential for Providing Regulation Service","sourcePdf":"tpwrs-kondoh-2090909-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.064299S","chronDate":"Aug.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"59","isNumber":"5958775","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"181","xplore-issue":"5958775","articleId":"5668519","onlineDate":"17 December 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5668521,"authors":[{"name":"Shih-Fu Liu","affiliation":["Universidad Antonio de Nebrija, Madrid, Spain"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/92/6099858/5668521/5668521-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Shih-Fu Liu received the B.Sc. degree in electronic engineering from Carinthian Tech Institute, Austria, in 2003, and the M.Sc. degree in computer system engineering from the Technical University of Denmark, Lyngby, Denmark, in 2005.

These systems use stereo video coding for pictures delivered by two input cameras. Typically, such stereo systems only reproduce these two camera views at the receiver and stereoscopic displays for multiple viewers require wearing special 3-D glasses. On the other hand, emerging autostereoscopic multiview displays emit a large numbers of views to enable 3-D viewing for multiple users without requiring 3-D glasses. For representing a large number of views, a multiview extension of stereo video coding is used, typically requiring a bit rate that is proportional to the number of views. However, since the quality improvement of multiview displays will be governed by an increase of emitted views, a format is needed that allows the generation of arbitrary numbers of views with the transmission bit rate being constant. Such a format is the combination of video signals and associated depth maps. The depth maps provide disparities associated with every sample of the video signal that can be used to render arbitrary numbers of additional views via view synthesis. This paper describes efficient coding methods for video and depth data. For the generation of views, synthesis methods are presented, which mitigate errors from depth estimation and coding.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Video signal

The method is based on a multiscale representation for both thickness and width of the superconducting domains. A couple of test cases were successfully simulated and further investigations were made by means of structured (mapped) meshes. Here, large aspect ratio elements were used to simulate thin material layers with a reduced number of elements. Hence, more complex geometries can be studied at considerable lower computational time. Several test cases were simulated including transport current, externally applied magnetic field and a combination of both. The results are in good agreement with recently published numerical simulations. The computational time to solve the present multiscale approach in 2D is estimated as two orders of magnitude faster than other 2D methods.","doi":"10.1109/TASC.2010.2091388","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Applied Superconductivity","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Applied Superconductivity","pdfPath":"/iel5/77/5776789/05668901.pdf","startPage":"3273","endPage":"3276","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TASC.2010.2091388","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5776789","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Towards Faster FEM Simulation of Thin Film Superconductors: A Multiscale Approach","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5668901/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 December 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2011","displayDocTitle":"Towards Faster FEM Simulation of Thin Film Superconductors: A Multiscale Approach","volume":"21","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12023120","htmlLink":"/document/5668901/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"27 May 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Towards Faster FEM Simulation of Thin Film Superconductors: A Multiscale Approach","sourcePdf":"tasc-rodriguezzermeno-2091388-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.048136S","chronDate":"June  2011","xplore-pub-id":"77","isNumber":"5776789","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"77","citationCount":"65","xplore-issue":"5776789","articleId":"5668901","onlineDate":"17 December 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5668904,"authors":[{"name":"Gui Gao","affiliation":["School of Electronic Science and Engineering, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Gui","lastName":"Gao","id":"37535450400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1545-598X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0571"}],"articleNumber":"5668904","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":56,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1258},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Society","url":"http://www.grss-ieee.org/"}],"abstract":"This letter proposes a Parzen-window-kernel-based algorithm for ship detection in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images.

Also, the S+N-ESC scheme for MPSK and 16-quadrature amplitude modulation (16-QAM) signaling in Nakagami-m and Rician fading channels is studied by computer simulations. The S+N-ESC selects the branch with the maximum S+N energy for detection. The advantage of the S+N-ESC scheme is that it requires no explicit channel estimation for diversity branch selection. We show that the symbol error probability (SEP) of the S+N-ESC is the same as that of classical selection combining (SC) for MPSK signaling in independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) Rayleigh fading channels. Also, we show that the SEP of a weighted S+N-ESC scheme is the same as that of classical SC for MPSK signaling in independent and nonidentically distributed (i.n.d.)

It is shown by computer simulations that the S+N-ESC scheme provides a smaller SEP than classical SC for MPSK signaling in nondispersive fading channels such as Nakagami-m fading channels with Nakagami parameter m >; 1 and Rician fading channels with Rician parameter K >; 0. On the other hand, the S+N-ESC scheme is shown by computer simulations to have a larger SEP than classical SC for 16-QAM signaling in Nakagami-m and Rician fading channels.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2011.120710.090512","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/5713793/05668917.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2011.120710.090512","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5713793","startPage":"448","endPage":"453","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"S+N Energy Selection Combining for MPSK and 16-QAM Signaling in Nakagami-m and Rician Fading Channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5668917","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"S+N Energy Selection Combining for MPSK and 16-QAM Signaling in Nakagami-m and Rician Fading Channels","chronOrPublicationDate":"February  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5668917/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 December 2010","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"59","issue":"2","publicationDate":"February 2011","accessionNumber":"11807437","dateOfInsertion":"14 February 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5668917/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"S+N Energy Selection Combining for MPSK and 16-QAM Signaling in Nakagami-m and Rician Fading Channels","sourcePdf":"448-tc1102-kim.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.143353S","chronDate":"February  2011","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"5713793","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5713793","articleId":"5668917","onlineDate":"17 December 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5668918,"authors":[{"name":"Li Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California, Davis, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/5713793/5668918/5668918-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Li Zhang received the B.E. and M.E. degrees from the National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University, Nanjing, China, in 2004 and 2006, respectively.

In 2001, Kou, Lin and Fossorier showed that the one-step majority-logic decodable finite geometry codes form a class of cyclic LDPC codes whose Tanner graphs are free of cycles of length 4. These cyclic finite geometry LDPC codes perform very well over the AWGN channel using iterative decoding based on belief propagation (IDBP) and have very low error-floors. However, the standard IDBP is not effective for decoding other cyclic finite geometry codes because their Tanner graphs contain too many short cycles of length 4 which severely degrade the decoding performance. This paper investigates iterative decoding of two-step majority-logic decodable finite geometry codes. Three effective algorithms for decoding these codes are proposed. These algorithms are devised based on the orthogonal structure of the parity-check matrices of the codes to avoid or reduce the degrading effect of the short cycles of length 4. These decoding algorithms provide significant coding gains over the standard IDBP using either the sum-product or the min-sum algorithms.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/5713793/05668918.pdf","startPage":"416","endPage":"427","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2010.120710.090624","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2010.120710.090624","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5713793","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5668918","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Iterative Algorithms for Decoding a Class of Two-Step Majority-Logic Decodable Cyclic Codes","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Iterative decoding","Decoding","Geometry","Polynomials","Reliability","Generators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["AWGN channels","cyclic codes","geometry","iterative decoding","parity check codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["tanner graph","LDPC code","AWGN channel","iterative decoding based on belief propagation","two-step majority-logic decodable cyclic finite geometry codes","parity-check matrix"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Finite geometry code","iterative decoding","two-fold EG-code","cyclic code"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5668918/","chronOrPublicationDate":"February  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 December 2010","displayDocTitle":"Iterative Algorithms for Decoding a Class of Two-Step Majority-Logic Decodable Cyclic Codes","volume":"59","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/5668918/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"February 2011","accessionNumber":"11807438","dateOfInsertion":"14 February 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Iterative Algorithms for Decoding a Class of Two-Step Majority-Logic Decodable Cyclic Codes","sourcePdf":"416-tc1102-zhang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.067922S","chronDate":"February  2011","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"5713793","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5713793","articleId":"5668918","onlineDate":"17 December 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5668919,"authors":[{"name":"Tao Cui","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/5713793/5668919/5668919-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Tao Cui (S'04) received the M.Sc. degree in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada, in 2005, and the M.S. degree from the Department of Electrical Engineering, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, USA, in 2006.

In this paper, we consider a practical scenario when these two parameters are unknown and are needed to be estimated before the spectrum sensing. This task is non-trivial without knowing the status of the primary user, and we categorize the related spectrum sensing as a blind one. We develop the estimation algorithms for unknown parameters by exploiting the signal constellation of the primary user. Three different parameter estimators that do not require any training are then proposed based on the moments of the received signals. Since the secondary user may not know the primary user's signal constellation, we develop a robust approach that approximates a finite quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) constellation by a continuous uniform distribution. We also derive the modified Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) for noise variance estimation. Then the optimal moment pair is found from minimizing the mean squared error (MSE) of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). The method of choosing the spectrum sensing threshold by taking into consideration the estimation error is also discussed.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2010.120710.090667","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/5713793/05668919.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2010.120710.090667","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5713793","startPage":"613","endPage":"623","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Moment-Based Parameter Estimation and Blind Spectrum Sensing for Quadrature Amplitude Modulation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5668919","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Moment-Based Parameter Estimation and Blind Spectrum Sensing for Quadrature Amplitude Modulation","chronOrPublicationDate":"February  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5668919/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 December 2010","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"59","issue":"2","publicationDate":"February 2011","accessionNumber":"11807439","dateOfInsertion":"14 February 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5668919/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Moment-Based Parameter Estimation and Blind Spectrum Sensing for Quadrature Amplitude Modulation","sourcePdf":"613-tc1102-cui.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.125301S","chronDate":"February  2011","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"5713793","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"5713793","articleId":"5668919","onlineDate":"17 December 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5668921,"authors":[{"name":"Nihar Jindal","affiliation":["University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/5713793/5668921/5668921-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Nihar Jindal (S'99-M'04) received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering and computer science from the University of California at Berkeley in 1999 and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from Stanford University, Stanford, CA, in 2001 and 2004, respectively.

This is in contrast to a large body of prior work in single-user, multiuser, and ad hoc wireless networks that have shown linear scaling is achievable when multiple receive and transmit antennas (i.e., MIMO transmission) are employed, but that throughput increases logarithmically or sublinearly with N_r when only a single transmit antenna (i.e., SIMO transmission) is used. The linear gain is achieved by using the receive degrees of freedom to simultaneously suppress interference and increase the power of the desired signal, and exploiting the subsequent performance benefit to increase the density of simultaneous transmissions instead of the transmission rate. This result is proven in the transmission capacity framework, which presumes single-hop transmissions in the presence of randomly located interferers, but it is also illustrated that the result holds under several relaxations of the model, including imperfect channel knowledge, multihop transmission, and regular networks (i.e., interferers are deterministically located on a grid).","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5668921/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 December 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"February  2011","publicationDate":"February 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5668921/","dateOfInsertion":"14 February 2011","accessionNumber":"11807441","volume":"59","issue":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Multi-Antenna Communication in Ad Hoc Networks: Achieving MIMO Gains with SIMO Transmission","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-Antenna Communication in Ad Hoc Networks: Achieving MIMO Gains with SIMO Transmission","sourcePdf":"529-tc1102-jindal.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.074805S","chronDate":"February  2011","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"5713793","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"135","xplore-issue":"5713793","articleId":"5668921","onlineDate":"17 December 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5668922,"authors":[{"name":"Gianluigi Liva","affiliation":["Institute of Communications and Navigation Digital Networks Section, German Aerospace Center, Wessling, Germany"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/5713793/5668922/5668922-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Gianluigi Liva was born in Spilimbergo, Italy, on July 23rd, 1977.

CRDSA relies on MAC bursts repetition and on interference cancellation (IC), achieving a peak throughput T \u2245 0.55, whereas for slotted ALOHA T \u2245 0.37. In this paper we show that the IC process of CRDSA can be conveniently described by a bipartite graph, establishing a bridge between the IC process and the iterative erasure decoding of graph-based codes. Exploiting this analogy, we show how a high throughput can be achieved by selecting variable burst repetition rates according to given probability distributions, leading to irregular graphs. A framework for the probability distribution optimization is provided. Based on that, we propose a novel scheme, named irregular repetition slotted ALOHA, that can achieve a throughput T \u2245 0.97 for large frames and near to T \u2245 0.8 in practical implementations, resulting in a gain of ~ 45% w.r.t. CRDSA. An analysis of the normalized efficiency is introduced, allowing performance comparisons under the constraint of equal average transmission power. Simulation results, including an IC mechanism described in the paper, substantiate the validity of the analysis and confirm the high efficiency of the proposed approach down to a signal-to-noise ratio as a low as E\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">b</sub>\n/N\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">0</sub>\n=2 dB.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2010.120710.100054","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5713793","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2010.120710.100054","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/5713793/05668922.pdf","startPage":"477","endPage":"487","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Graph-Based Analysis and Optimization of Contention Resolution Diversity Slotted ALOHA","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 December 2010","displayDocTitle":"Graph-Based Analysis and Optimization of Contention Resolution Diversity Slotted ALOHA","volume":"59","issue":"2","chronOrPublicationDate":"February  2011","dateOfInsertion":"14 February 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5668922/","publicationDate":"February 2011","accessionNumber":"11807442","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5668922/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Graph-Based Analysis and Optimization of Contention Resolution Diversity Slotted ALOHA","sourcePdf":"477-tc1102-liva.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.105883S","chronDate":"February  2011","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"5713793","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"379","xplore-issue":"5713793","articleId":"5668922","onlineDate":"17 December 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5668982,"authors":[{"name":"Fazirulhisyam Hashim","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Information Engineering, University of Sydney, NSW, Australia"],"bio":{"p":["Fazirulhisyam Hashim (S'07) is a Ph.D. candidate at the School of Electrical and Information Engineering, the University of Sydney, Australia.

This vision can be accomplished by integrating the existing and emerging access networks via a common Internet Protocol (IP) based platform. Nevertheless, owing to the inter-worked infrastructure, a malicious security threat in such a heterogeneous network is no more confined to its originating network domain, but can easily be propagated to other access networks. To address these security concerns, this paper proposes a biologically inspired security framework that governs the cooperation among network entities to identify security attacks, to perform security updates, and to inhibit attacks propagation in the heterogeneous network. The proposed framework incorporates two principal security components, in the form of anomaly detection framework and security control framework. Several plausible principles from two fields of biology, in particular the human immune system (HIS) and epidemiology have been adopted into the proposed security framework. Performance evaluation demonstrates the efficiency of the proposed biologically inspired security framework in detecting malicious anomalies such as denial-of-service (DoS), distributed DoS (DDoS), and worms, as well as restricting their propagations in the heterogeneous network.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Biologically Inspired Anomaly Detection and Security Control Frameworks for Complex Heterogeneous Networks","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Network and Service Management","doi":"10.1109/TNSM.2010.1012.0360","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Network and Service Management","pdfPath":"/iel5/4275028/5668974/05668982.pdf","startPage":"268","endPage":"281","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNSM.2010.1012.0360","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5668974","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5668982","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5668982/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 December 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"December  2010","displayDocTitle":"Biologically Inspired Anomaly Detection and Security Control Frameworks for Complex Heterogeneous Networks","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"7","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/5668982/","dateOfInsertion":"17 December 2010","publicationDate":"December 2010","accessionNumber":"11698257","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Biologically Inspired Anomaly Detection and Security Control Frameworks for Complex Heterogeneous Networks","sourcePdf":"268-tn1012-hashim.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.071593S","chronDate":"December  2010","xplore-pub-id":"4275028","isNumber":"5668974","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4275028","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"5668974","articleId":"5668982","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5668992,"authors":[{"name":"Bin Yu","firstName":"Bin","lastName":"Yu"},{"name":"Yan Zhang","firstName":"Yan","lastName":"Zhang"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8627-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5668992","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":40},"abstract":"The increasing protein sequences from the genome project require theoretical methods to predict transmembrane helical segments (TMHs).

Also, an improved receiver based on soft interference cancellation and MMSE filtering is proposed: The posterior information not extrinsic information is fed back from outer decoder to inner detector.

In this paper, we propose a novel method for lung sounds feature extraction based on AR model bispectrum estimation. By the bispectral cross correlation analysis, select AR model orders and apply them to estimate the parametric bispectrum of the lung sound signals. Then extract bispectrum features of lung sound signals (normal, pneumonia and asthma) and compare them in bi-frequency domain. To get more information of bispectrum, the method presented divides a cycle into inspiration phase and expiration phase. Peaks of bispectrum, normalized bispectral entropy and parameters of slice spectrum are selected to form the feature vector for lung sounds classification. The results show that bispectrum analysis of lung sounds is applicable and effective. And our work will provide assistant information for early diagnosis of lung-thorax disease.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Lungs","Feature extraction","Estimation","Mathematical model","Time domain analysis","Entropy","Signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["acoustic signal processing","diseases","entropy","feature extraction","Gaussian processes","lung","medical signal processing","spectral analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feature extraction","lung sounds","bispectrum analysis","higher-order spectral techniques","nonGaussian signal processing","AR model bispectrum estimation","bispectral cross correlation analysis","asthma","pneumonia","bispectral entropy","slice spectrum","lung-thorax disease"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["feature extraction","bispectrum","lung sounds","AR model"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ISIP.2010.136","publicationTitle":"2010 Third International Symposium on Information Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 Third International Symposium on Information Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5668579/5668972/05669122.pdf","startPage":"393","endPage":"397","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5668972","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIP.2010.136","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Feature Extraction of Lung Sounds Based on Bispectrum Analysis","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5669122","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Feature Extraction of Lung Sounds Based on Bispectrum Analysis","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5669122/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5669122/","accessionNumber":"11699025","conferenceDate":"15-17 Oct. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"17 December 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 Oct. 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Feature Extraction of Lung Sounds Based on Bispectrum Analysis","confLoc":"Qingdao, China","sourcePdf":"4261a393.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046087S","chronDate":"15-17 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5668579","isNumber":"5668972","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5668579","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"5668972","articleId":"5669122","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5669143,"authors":[{"name":"Shen-Fu Hsiao","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, National Sun Yat-sen University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Shen-Fu","lastName":"Hsiao","id":"37274340300"},{"name":"Chia-Shen Wen","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, National Sun Yat-sen University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chia-Shen","lastName":"Wen","id":"37599505400"},{"name":"Hsin-Mau Lee","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, National Sun Yat-sen University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Hsin-Mau","lastName":"Lee","id":"37599330400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6694-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6693-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6692-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2378-8593"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2378-8607"}],"articleNumber":"5669143","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":271},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Accuracy","Lead","CMOS integrated circuits","Adders"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adders","digital arithmetic","read-only storage","table lookup"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["floating-point CORDIC rotation","multipliers","floating-point CORDIC operations","microrotation stages","hardware components","high-precision arithmetic operations","3D graphic acceleration","ROM","adders"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["CORDIC","arithmetic","look up table","floating-point operations","function approximation"]}],"abstract":"A unified design is presented that can execute floating-point CORDIC operations in both rotation and vectoring modes with significantly reduced computation latency.

Unfortunately, ultra-low power SRAM encounters serious timing uncertainty. One of the major problems is that the conventional voltage-clamping circuits cannot work when the bitlines have serious with-in-die variations. The full swing, usually required on the bitline, causes unwanted power dispassion. Therefore, this work proposes a novel SRAM cell that can clamp the bitline voltage autonomously. This voltage clamping is also independent in each bitline and is adapted automatically under dynamic voltage scaling. The dynamic power on bitline discharge can be saved by 75% by using the proposed structure, with an acceptable overhead in access time.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5669177/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-19 Nov. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"Nov. 2010","accessionNumber":"11699319","htmlLink":"/document/5669177/","dateOfInsertion":"17 December 2010","conferenceDate":"18-19 Nov. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A subthreshold SRAM cell with autonomous bitline-voltage clamping","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A subthreshold SRAM cell with autonomous bitline-voltage clamping","confLoc":"Kaohsiung, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"40ISNE0118.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061238S","chronDate":"18-19 Nov. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5658190","isNumber":"5669130","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5658190","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5669130","articleId":"5669177","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":5669180,"authors":[{"name":"Cheng-Hsin Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Sun Yat-sen University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Cheng-Hsin","lastName":"Chen","id":"37539294600"},{"name":"Jyi-Tsong Lin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Sun Yat-sen University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Jyi-Tsong","lastName":"Lin","id":"37349898000"},{"name":"Yi-Chuen Eng","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Sun Yat-sen University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yi-Chuen","lastName":"Eng","id":"37540406400"},{"name":"Po-Hsieh Lin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Sun Yat-sen University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Po-Hsieh","lastName":"Lin","id":"37536676900"},{"name":"Hsien-Nan Chiu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Sun Yat-sen University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Hsien-Nan","lastName":"Chiu","id":"37309414100"},{"name":"Tzu-Feng Chang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Sun Yat-sen University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Tzu-Feng","lastName":"Chang","id":"37292028600"},{"name":"Chih-Hsuan Tai","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Sun Yat-sen University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chih-Hsuan","lastName":"Tai","id":"37528451300"},{"name":"Kuan-Yu Lu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Sun Yat-sen University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Kuan-Yu","lastName":"Lu","id":"37535454300"},{"name":"Yi-Hsuan Fan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Sun Yat-sen University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yi-Hsuan","lastName":"Fan","id":"37539939300"},{"name":"Yu-Che Chang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Sun Yat-sen University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yu-Che","lastName":"Chang","id":"37537830800"},{"name":"Hsuan-Hsu Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Sun Yat-sen University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Hsuan-Hsu","lastName":"Chen","id":"37539858800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6694-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6693-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6692-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2378-8593"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2378-8607"}],"articleNumber":"5669180","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":256},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Random access memory","Logic gates","Writing","Oxidation","Performance evaluation","Implants","Fabrication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DRAM chips","MOSFET"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["vertical MOSFET","bMPI structure","1T-DRAM application","middle partial insulation and block oxide","pseudo-neutral region","double gate structure","short-channel effects","electrical characteristics"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Vertical","bMPI","1T-DRAM","Capacitorless"]}],"abstract":"This paper proposes a novel vertical MOSFET with the middle partial insulation and block oxide (bMPI) structure for 1T-DRAM application.

Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm is robust for a wide SNR range, and performs better in the estimation of the IQ imbalance.","doi":"10.1109/ISNE.2010.5669203","publicationTitle":"2010 International Symposium on Next Generation Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Symposium on Next Generation Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/5658190/5669130/05669203.pdf","startPage":"52","endPage":"55","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISNE.2010.5669203","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5669130","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"LS-based joint estimation of carrier frequency offset and IQ imbalance in OFDM systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5669203","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-19 Nov. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5669203/","displayDocTitle":"LS-based joint estimation of carrier frequency offset and IQ imbalance in OFDM systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2010","accessionNumber":"11703482","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5669203/","conferenceDate":"18-19 Nov. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"17 December 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"LS-based joint estimation of carrier frequency offset and IQ imbalance in OFDM systems","confLoc":"Kaohsiung, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"14ISNE0066.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05062S","chronDate":"18-19 Nov. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5658190","isNumber":"5669130","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5658190","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"5669130","articleId":"5669203","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5669231,"authors":[{"name":"Hu Jin","affiliation":["Department of EE, KAIST, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/5711712/5669231/5669231-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Hu Jin (S'07) received the B.S. degree in Electronic Engineering and Information Science from University of Science and Technology of China (USTC), China, in 2004 and the M.S. degree in Electrical Engineering from Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), Korea, in 2006.

It may result in a significant decrease in the spectral efficiency. In order to overcome this drawback, recently, a persistent scheduling scheme has been standardized in standard bodies. In order to reduce the signaling overhead, the modulation and coding scheme (MCS) is set to be fixed during a burst period for the persistent scheduling procedure and an incomplete transmission, if it occurs, is recovered by a hybrid automatic repeat request (HARQ) scheme. In this paper, considering the HARQ retransmissions, we propose a rate selection scheme for the persistent scheduling satisfying given quality of service (QoS) requirements. In our proposed rate selection scheme, we consider two important factors which were not considered in previous HARQ-related work: time-correlations of the wireless channel in the HARQ retransmissions and the resource usage of signaling overhead. Numerical results show that the proposed rate selection scheme can efficiently enhance the utilization of radio resources compared to the conventional schemes.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/5711712/05669231.pdf","startPage":"637","endPage":"647","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2011.120810.100634","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2011.120810.100634","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5711712","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5669231","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal Rate Selection for Persistent Scheduling with HARQ in Time-Correlated Nakagami-m Fading Channels","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fading","Wireless communication","Resource management","Signal to noise ratio","Dynamic scheduling","Approximation methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automatic repeat request","encoding","frequency division multiple access","Nakagami channels","OFDM modulation","quality of service","scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimal rate selection","persistent scheduling","HARQ scheme","time-correlated Nakagami-m fading channels","orthogonal frequency division multiple access","3GPP long term evolution","voice over IP service","LTE","VoIP service","modulation and coding scheme","MCS","hybrid automatic repeat request scheme","quality of service","QoS","wireless channel"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["HARQ","rate selection","persistent scheduling","time-correlated channel"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5669231/","chronOrPublicationDate":"February  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 December 2010","displayDocTitle":"Optimal Rate Selection for Persistent Scheduling with HARQ in Time-Correlated Nakagami-m Fading Channels","volume":"10","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/5669231/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"February 2011","accessionNumber":"11805100","dateOfInsertion":"10 February 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal Rate Selection for Persistent Scheduling with HARQ in Time-Correlated Nakagami-m Fading Channels","sourcePdf":"637-tw1102-jin.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.101251S","chronDate":"February  2011","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"5711712","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"5711712","articleId":"5669231","onlineDate":"17 December 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-28"},{"_id":5669232,"authors":[{"name":"Yupeng Jia","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Rochester, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Yupeng","lastName":"Jia","id":"37399277600"},{"name":"Azadeh Vosoughi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Rochester, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Azadeh","lastName":"Vosoughi","id":"37284729900"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1536-1276"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2248"}],"articleNumber":"5669232","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":18,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":783},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/organizations/society/sp/index.html#pub"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Training","Channel estimation","Resource management","Mutual information","Noise","Fading"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplify and forward communication","optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["transmission resource allocation","amplify-and-forward relay systems","training-based mutual information","optimal power allocation","joint optimization problem"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Amplify-and-forward (AF) cooperation","block transmission","channel estimation error","fading channels","mutual information lower bound","relay channels","relay location","power allocation","training design"]}],"abstract":"For a three node amplify-and-forward (AF) relay system in which only destination D is equipped with a channel estimator, we derive lower bound on training-based mutual information per transmission block.

Wireless networks can benefit significantly from NC due to their broadcast nature and the opportunity of enhancing bandwidth utilization. In this paper, we develop Multi-Generation Mixing (MGM), which is a generalized approach for generation based network coding. With traditional generation based NC sender packets are grouped in generations where encoding and decoding are performed on packets that belong to the same generation. In scenarios where losses cause insufficient reception of encoded packets, NC losses occur. NC losses are expensive; the minimum unit of loss is the loss of one generation. The proposed MGM framework allows the encoding among generations for the purpose of enhancing NC decodability. With MGM in scenarios where insufficient number of encodings received of a generation, it is still possible to recover the generation using data encoded in other generations. We develop MGM encoding and decoding approaches, and demonstrate the improvements in performance achieved by MGM. Further, a canonical analytical model for MGM network coding is developed, and, extensive simulations over random wireless networks experiencing random packet losses are presented.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/5711712/05669233.pdf","startPage":"466","endPage":"473","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2011.120810.090280","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2011.120810.090280","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5711712","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5669233","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Network Coding with Multi-Generation Mixing: A Generalized Framework for Practical Network Coding","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Encoding","Decoding","Indexes","Network coding","Receivers","Wireless networks","Vectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decoding","network coding","packet radio networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multi-generation mixing","MGM encoding","MGM decoding","practical network coding","NC sender packets","NC decodability","random wireless networks","broadcast nature","bandwidth utilization","random packet losses"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Network coding","generation based network coding","multi-generation mixing","mixing set","position index"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5669233/","chronOrPublicationDate":"February  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 December 2010","displayDocTitle":"Network Coding with Multi-Generation Mixing: A Generalized Framework for Practical Network Coding","volume":"10","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/5669233/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"February 2011","accessionNumber":"11805102","dateOfInsertion":"10 February 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Network Coding with Multi-Generation Mixing: A Generalized Framework for Practical Network Coding","sourcePdf":"466-tw1102-halloush.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.045302S","chronDate":"February  2011","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"5711712","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"5711712","articleId":"5669233","onlineDate":"17 December 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5669234,"authors":[{"name":"Daiming Qu","affiliation":["Wuhan National Laboratory for Optoelectronics, Department of Electronics and Information Engineering, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/5711712/5669234/5669234-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Daiming Qu received a Ph.D. degree in information and communication engineering from Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, P.

In this paper, we propose two novel detection schemes, i.e., hard-decision-based detection (HDD) and soft-decision-based detection (SDD) schemes, to detect NC-OFDM symbols without the information of out-of-band spectrum synchronization. The key idea of the proposed schemes is to employ the received training symbol to calculate a posterior probability (APP) of each subchannel's being active. Specifically, for the proposed HDD scheme, the secondary receiver detects whether a subchannel is active or not based on its APP. When the APP of a subchannel is larger than a preset threshold, it will be employed for the data detection. Moreover, we derive the miss detection and false alarm probabilities of the hard decision based detection of active subchannels, respectively. For the proposed SDD scheme, all subchannels are employed for the data detection, in which as a priori information of the subchannels' being active, all APPs are taken into account in the bit metric calculation. Theoretical analysis and simulation results show that the proposed schemes can provide satisfactory performance.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2011.120810.101324","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/5711712/05669234.pdf","startPage":"693","endPage":"701","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2011.120810.101324","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5711712","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Detection of Non-Contiguous OFDM Symbols for Cognitive Radio Systems without Out-of-Band Spectrum Synchronization","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5669234","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 December 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"February  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5669234/","displayDocTitle":"Detection of Non-Contiguous OFDM Symbols for Cognitive Radio Systems without Out-of-Band Spectrum Synchronization","volume":"10","issue":"2","publicationDate":"February 2011","accessionNumber":"11805103","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5669234/","dateOfInsertion":"10 February 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Detection of Non-Contiguous OFDM Symbols for Cognitive Radio Systems without Out-of-Band Spectrum Synchronization","sourcePdf":"693-tw1102-qu.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073338S","chronDate":"February  2011","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"5711712","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"5711712","articleId":"5669234","onlineDate":"17 December 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5669235,"authors":[{"name":"Qiuliang Xie","affiliation":["Tsinghua National Laboratory for Information Science and Technology (TNList), Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/5711712/5669235/5669235-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Qiuliang Xie was born in Hunan, China.

This paper investigates issues of combining SSD with coded modulation systems (CMSs), e.g., bit-interleaved coded modulation (BICM) and its iterative version, BICM-ID. It demonstrates that the average mutual information (AMI) between the signal after rotated constellation mapping and the signal before or after the soft demapper varies with the rotation angle. A new criterion for determining the optimal rotation angle by maximizing such AMI is therefore proposed. Specific considerations of combining SSD with BICM (BICM-SSD) and BICM-ID (BICM-ID-SSD) are addressed. The demapper's extrinsic information transfer (EXIT) curve in traditional BICM-ID systems exhibits different slopes under different channels, which consequently prevents traditional BICM-ID systems from having simultaneously excellent performance under different channels. It is shown that such a different-slope problem can be simply mitigated by a proper use of SSD. Analysis and simulation show that the proposed BICM-ID-SSD systems hold a near-capacity performance under both additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) and Rayleigh fading channels simultaneously.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Coded Modulation with Signal Space Diversity","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2011.120810.100951","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/5711712/05669235.pdf","startPage":"660","endPage":"669","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2011.120810.100951","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5711712","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5669235","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5669235/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 December 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"February  2011","displayDocTitle":"Coded Modulation with Signal Space Diversity","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"10","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/5669235/","dateOfInsertion":"10 February 2011","publicationDate":"February 2011","accessionNumber":"11805104","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Coded Modulation with Signal Space Diversity","sourcePdf":"660-tw1102-xie.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.076548S","chronDate":"February  2011","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"5711712","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"37","xplore-issue":"5711712","articleId":"5669235","onlineDate":"17 December 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5669236,"authors":[{"name":"Wonjae Shin","affiliation":["Samsung Advanced Institute of Technology, Samsung Electronics Company Limited, South Korea"],"firstName":"Wonjae","lastName":"Shin","id":"37595072100"},{"name":"Namyoon Lee","affiliation":["Samsung Advanced Institute of Technology, Samsung Electronics Company Limited, South Korea"],"firstName":"Namyoon","lastName":"Lee","id":"37403846100"},{"name":"Jong-Bu Lim","affiliation":["Samsung Advanced Institute of Technology, Samsung Electronics Company Limited, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jong-Bu","lastName":"Lim","id":"37290232400"},{"name":"Changyong Shin","affiliation":["Samsung Advanced Institute of Technology, Samsung Electronics Company Limited, South Korea"],"firstName":"Changyong","lastName":"Shin","id":"37275053000"},{"name":"Kyunghun Jang","affiliation":["Samsung Advanced Institute of Technology, Samsung Electronics Company Limited, South Korea"],"firstName":"Kyunghun","lastName":"Jang","id":"37331813900"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1536-1276"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2248"}],"articleNumber":"5669236","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":138,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":2948},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/organizations/society/sp/index.html#pub"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference","Array signal processing","Receiving antennas","MIMO","Transmitting antennas","Signal to noise ratio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","broadcast channels","Gaussian channels","interference suppression","MIMO communication","receiving antennas","transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["two-cell MIMO interfering broadcast channels","interference alignment scheme","interference mitigation","wireless communication","Gaussian interfering broadcast channels","MIMO-IFBC","transmit antennas","receive antennas","cellular networks","base stations","beamforming vectors"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Degrees of freedom","MIMO interfering broadcast channels","interference alignment","multiple antenna systems"]}],"abstract":"The interference alignment (IA) is a promising technique to effectively mitigate interferences in wireless communication systems. To show the potential benefits of such an IA scheme, this letter focuses on a two-cell multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) Gaussian interfering broadcast channels (MIMO-IFBC) with M transmit antennas and N receive antennas. It corresponds to a downlink scenario for cellular networks with two base stations (BSs) with M transmit antennas per BS, and two users with N receive antennas per user, on the cell-boundary of each BS. In this scenario, we propose a novel IA technique jointly designing transmit and receive beamforming vectors in a closed-form expression without iterative computation. It is also analytically shown that the proposed IA algorithm achieves the optimal degrees of freedom (DoF) of 2N in the case of [\u00beN] \u2264 M <; 2N.

The optimal minimum power beamformers can be obtained locally at each base station (BS) relying on limited backhaul information exchange between BSs. The original centralized problem is reformulated such that the BSs are coupled by real-valued inter-cell interference terms. The coupling is handled by taking local copies of the interference terms at each BS and enforcing consistency between them. The consistency constraints are then decoupled by a standard dual decomposition approach leading to a distributed algorithm. The proposed method is able to guarantee feasible solutions even if the interference information is outdated or incomplete. In addition, the proposed approach allows for a number of special cases, where the backhaul information exchange is reduced at the cost of somewhat sub-optimal performance. The performance of the proposed coordinated multi-cell transmission is compared with the coherent multi-cell beamforming and with inter-cell interference nulling in different scenarios with varying interference. A near-optimal performance can be achieved even with significantly reduced backhaul information exchange and with relatively high velocities and/or low backhaul signaling rates.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2011.120810.100363","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/5711712/05669237.pdf","startPage":"570","endPage":"580","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2011.120810.100363","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5711712","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Decentralized Minimum Power Multi-Cell Beamforming with Limited Backhaul Signaling","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5669237","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 December 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"February  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5669237/","displayDocTitle":"Decentralized Minimum Power Multi-Cell Beamforming with Limited Backhaul Signaling","volume":"10","issue":"2","publicationDate":"February 2011","accessionNumber":"11805106","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5669237/","dateOfInsertion":"10 February 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Decentralized Minimum Power Multi-Cell Beamforming with Limited Backhaul Signaling","sourcePdf":"570-tw1102-tolli.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.063366S","chronDate":"February  2011","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"5711712","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"114","xplore-issue":"5711712","articleId":"5669237","onlineDate":"17 December 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5669238,"authors":[{"name":"Hideki Ochiai","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Yokohama National University, Yokohama, Kanagawa, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/5711712/5669238/5669238-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Hideki Ochiai (S'97, M'01) received the B.E. degree in communication engineering from Osaka University, Osaka, Japan, in 1996, and the M.E. and Ph.D. degrees in information and communication engineering from the University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan, in 1998 and 2001, respectively.","From 1994 to 1995, he was with the Department of Electrical Engineering, University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), CA, under the scholarship of the Ministry of Education, Science, and Culture.

Our second approach is thus based on approximation, which is valid only for M-ary phase shift keying (MPSK) or phase-shifted MPSK constellations, but requires substantially less computation. The validity of the proposed approaches is confirmed by numerical analysis.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2011.120810.100755","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/5711712/05669238.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2011.120810.100755","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5711712","startPage":"682","endPage":"692","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Exact and Approximate Distributions of Instantaneous Power for Pulse-Shaped Single-Carrier Signals","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5669238","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Exact and Approximate Distributions of Instantaneous Power for Pulse-Shaped Single-Carrier Signals","chronOrPublicationDate":"February  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5669238/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 December 2010","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"10","issue":"2","publicationDate":"February 2011","accessionNumber":"11805107","dateOfInsertion":"10 February 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5669238/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Exact and Approximate Distributions of Instantaneous Power for Pulse-Shaped Single-Carrier Signals","sourcePdf":"682-tw1102-ochiai.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.114134S","chronDate":"February  2011","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"5711712","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"5711712","articleId":"5669238","onlineDate":"17 December 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5669239,"authors":[{"name":"Zhihang Yi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Queen's University, Kingston, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Zhihang","lastName":"Yi","id":"37304115700"},{"name":"MinChul Ju","affiliation":["Korea Electronics and Technology Institute, Seoul, South Korea","Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Queen's University, Kingston, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"MinChul","lastName":"Ju","id":"37339310500"},{"name":"Il-Min Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Queen's University, Kingston, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Il-Min","lastName":"Kim","id":"37278943200"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1536-1276"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2248"}],"articleNumber":"5669239","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":119,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2153},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/organizations/society/sp/index.html#pub"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Protocols","Resource management","Signal to noise ratio","Mutual information","Relays","Diversity methods","Multiplexing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplify and forward communication","multiplexing","network coding","power aware computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["outage probability","optimum power allocation","analog network coding","amplify-and-forward-based bidirectional protocol","bidirectional network","information exchange","half-duplex mode","finite-SNR diversity-multiplexing","ANC protocol"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Amplify-and-forward (AF)","analog network coding (ANC)","bidirectional network","power allocation","outage probability"]}],"abstract":"We study the analog network coding (ANC), which is a well-known amplify-and-forward (AF)-based bidirectional protocol, for a bidirectional network consisting of two different sources and a relay. In this protocol, the two sources exchange information with the help of the relay during two time slots in a half-duplex mode. For this system, we first derive a tight lower bound of outage probability, which is very close to the exact outage probability in the whole signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) range irrespective of the values of channel variances. Using the tight lower bound, we obtain finite-SNR diversity-multiplexing tradeoff of the ANC protocol. Furthermore, we propose an optimum power allocation scheme, which simultaneously minimizes the outage probability and maximizes the total mutual information of the ANC protocol.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2011.120810.100873","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/5711712/05669239.pdf","startPage":"407","endPage":"412","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2011.120810.100873","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5711712","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Outage Probability and Optimum Power Allocation for Analog Network Coding","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5669239","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 December 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"February  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5669239/","displayDocTitle":"Outage Probability and Optimum Power Allocation for Analog Network Coding","volume":"10","issue":"2","publicationDate":"February 2011","accessionNumber":"11805108","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5669239/","dateOfInsertion":"10 February 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Outage Probability and Optimum Power Allocation for Analog Network Coding","sourcePdf":"407-tw1102-yi.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.060178S","chronDate":"February  2011","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"5711712","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"119","xplore-issue":"5711712","articleId":"5669239","onlineDate":"17 December 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5669241,"authors":[{"name":"Jinsong Wu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, ONT, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/5711712/5669241/5669241-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jinsong Wu received the B.Eng. degree from Changsha Railway University (now part of Central South University), Changsha, China, in 1990, the M.A.Sc. degree from Dalhousie University, Halifax, NS, Canada, in 2001, the Ph.D. degree from Queen's University, Kingston, ON, Canada, in 2006, all in electrical engineering.

We analyze diversity gains of DSTFCs through both conditional and average pairwise error probability (PEP), and we proposes better design criteria based on one-side channel conditional PEP. We show that the difference between the frequency-selective channel orders of source-to-relay and relay-to-destination links may provide extra diversity advantages, thus additional performance gains.

Existing data path merging techniques based on resource sharing can be deployed to improve area efficiency of custom instructions. However, these techniques lead to large increase in the critical path delay. In this paper, we propose a novel strategy that takes into account the architectural constraints of the FPGA device in order to realize custom instructions with low-area delay product. The proposed strategy is based on partitioning the custom instruction data paths into a set of basic clusters such that they can be combined using a heuristic-based cluster merging process to maximize the utilization of FPGA logic blocks. Unlike the resource sharing method, the proposed cluster merging process does not maximize sharing of common resources and this leads to lesser reliance on multiplexers for implementing custom instructions. Resource sharing is only applied sparingly at the final stage to increase utilization of logic blocks. We show that the proposed technique leads to more than 34 percent, 34 percent, and 42 percent average reduction in area costs for Spartan-3, Virtex-4, and Virtex-5 architectures, respectively, when compared to optimizations achieved through commercial synthesis tool. We have also shown that the proposed technique leads to more than 18 percent, 17 percent, and 13 percent average reduction in area costs for Spartan-3, Virtex-4, and Virtex-5, respectively, when compared to results obtained using one of the most efficient resource sharing-based method reported in the literature. In addition, the proposed technique outperforms the resource sharing-based method in terms of area-delay product, with average reductions of more than 27 percent, 34 percent, and 19 percent for Spartan-3, Virtex-4, and Virtex-5, respectively.","doi":"10.1109/TC.2010.237","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/12/5739139/05669259.pdf","startPage":"680","endPage":"692","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5739139","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.2010.237","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Architecture-Aware Technique for Mapping Area-Time Efficient Custom Instructions onto FPGAs","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 December 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5669259/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2011","displayDocTitle":"Architecture-Aware Technique for Mapping Area-Time Efficient Custom Instructions onto FPGAs","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5669259/","dateOfInsertion":"24 March 2011","publicationDate":"May 2011","accessionNumber":"11883139","isJournal":true,"volume":"60","issue":"5","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Architecture-Aware Technique for Mapping Area-Time Efficient Custom Instructions onto FPGAs","sourcePdf":"ttc2011050680.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.114884S","chronDate":"May  2011","xplore-pub-id":"12","isNumber":"5739139","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"5739139","articleId":"5669259","onlineDate":"17 December 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5669260,"authors":[{"name":"Ping Xu","affiliation":["Illinois Institute of Technology, Chicago, IL, US"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/12/5721121/5669260/5669260-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ping Xu received the BS and MS degrees in electronic engineering from Shanghai Jiaotong University, China, in 1999 and 2003, respectively.

We assume that each secondary user will bid a certain value for exclusive usage of some spectrum channels for a certain time period or for a certain time duration. A secondary user may also require the exclusive usage of a subset of channels, or require the exclusive usage of a certain number of channels. Thus, several versions of problems are formulated under various different assumptions. For the majority of problems, we design PTAS or efficient constant-approximation algorithms such that overall profit is maximized. Here, the profit is defined as the total bids of all satisfied secondary users. As a side product of our algorithms, we are able to show that a previously studied Scheduling Split Interval Problem (SSIP), in which each job is composed of t intervals, cannot be approximated within O(t\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1-\u2208</sup>\n) for any small \u2208 >; 0 unless NP = ZPP. Opportunistic spectrum usage, although a promising technology, could suffer from the selfish behavior of secondary users. In order to improve opportunistic spectrum usage, we then propose to combine the game theory with wireless modeling. We show how to design a truthful mechanism based on all of these algorithms such that the best strategy of each secondary user to maximize its own profit is to truthfully report its actual bid.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.2010.241","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5721121","startPage":"580","endPage":"593","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/12/5721121/05669260.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient and Strategyproof Spectrum Allocations in Multichannel Wireless Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5669260/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 December 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5669260/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Efficient and Strategyproof Spectrum Allocations in Multichannel Wireless Networks","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2011","accessionNumber":"11837635","dateOfInsertion":"28 February 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"60","issue":"4","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient and Strategyproof Spectrum Allocations in Multichannel Wireless Networks","sourcePdf":"ttc2011040580.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.084789S","chronDate":"April  2011","xplore-pub-id":"12","isNumber":"5721121","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"33","xplore-issue":"5721121","articleId":"5669260","onlineDate":"17 December 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5669261,"authors":[{"name":"Derek Pao","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/12/6029369/5669261/5669261-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Derek Pao received the BSc(Eng) degree in electrical engineering from the University of Hong Kong, and the MCompSc and PhD degrees in computer science from Concordia University, Canada.

The proposed QSV method is based on quick sampling of the input stream against fixed-length pattern prefixes, and on-demand verification of variable-length pattern suffixes. Patterns handled by the QSV method are required to have at least 16 bytes, and possess distinct 16-byte prefixes. The latter requirement can be fulfilled by a preprocessing procedure. The search engine uses the pipelined Aho-Corasick (P-AC) architecture developed by the first author to process 4 to 15-byte short patterns and a small number of exception cases. Our design was evaluated using the ClamAV virus database having 82,888 strings with a total size that exceeds 8 Mbyte. In terms of byte count, 99.3 percent of the pattern set is handled by the QSV method and 0.7 percent of the pattern set is handled by P-AC. A pattern with distinct 16-byte prefix only occupies up to three lookup table entries in QSV. The overall memory cost of our system is about 1.4 Mbyte, i.e., 1.4 bit per character of the ClamAV pattern set. The proposed method is memory-based, hence, updates to the pattern set can be accommodated by modifying the contents of the lookup tables without reconfiguring the hardware circuits.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.2010.250","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6029369","startPage":"1596","endPage":"1609","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/12/6029369/05669261.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"String Searching Engine for Virus Scanning","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5669261/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 December 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5669261/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"String Searching Engine for Virus Scanning","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2011","accessionNumber":"12244791","dateOfInsertion":"26 September 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"60","issue":"11","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"String Searching Engine for Virus Scanning","sourcePdf":"ttc2011111596.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.110979S","chronDate":"Nov.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"12","isNumber":"6029369","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"6029369","articleId":"5669261","onlineDate":"17 December 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-27"},{"_id":5669262,"authors":[{"name":"Chun-Lung Hsu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Dong Hwa University, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chun-Lung","lastName":"Hsu","id":"37290471700"},{"name":"Yu-Sheng Huang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Dong Hwa University, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yu-Sheng","lastName":"Huang","id":"37291625700"},{"name":"Ming-Da Chang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Dong Hwa University, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Ming-Da","lastName":"Chang","id":"37596554900"},{"name":"Hung-Yen Huang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Dong Hwa University, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Hung-Yen","lastName":"Huang","id":"37593439900"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9340"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9956"},{"format":"CD","value":"2326-3814"}],"articleNumber":"5669262","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":617},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Discrete wavelet transforms","Transform coding","Image coding","Filter bank","Low pass filters","Numerical models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data compression","discrete wavelet transforms","error detection","image coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discrete wavelet transform","JPEG 2000 encoder","image compression","signal analysis","computer-induced errors","equivalent check value","error detection time","error tolerance capability"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["JPEG 2000","DWT","error detection","error tolerance."]}],"abstract":"The JPEG 2000 image compression standard is designed for a broad range of data compression applications. The discrete wavelet transformation (DWT), central to the signal analysis and important in the JPEG 2000, is quite susceptible to computer-induced errors. The errors can be spread to many output transform coefficients if the DWT is implemented by using lifting scheme. This paper proposes an efficient error tolerance scheme (ETS) to detect errors occurring in DWT. A pipeline-based DWT structure is also developed in this paper to speed up the error detection process. The proposed ETS design uses weighting sums of the DWT coefficients at the output compared with an equivalent check value derived from the input-data. With the proposed ETS design, the errors introduced at DWT can be effectively detected. Additionally, the results of error detection can be further analyzed and evaluated to show the capability of error tolerance. Some standard images are used as test samples to verify the feasibility of the proposed ETS design. Experimental results and comparisons show that the proposed ETS has good performance in error detection time and error tolerance capability.","doi":"10.1109/TC.2010.239","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/12/5739139/05669262.pdf","startPage":"628","endPage":"638","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.2010.239","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5739139","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of an Error-Tolerance Scheme for Discrete Wavelet Transform in JPEG 2000 Encoder","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5669262","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 December 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5669262/","displayDocTitle":"Design of an Error-Tolerance Scheme for Discrete Wavelet Transform in JPEG 2000 Encoder","volume":"60","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 2011","accessionNumber":"11883140","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"24 March 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of an Error-Tolerance Scheme for Discrete Wavelet Transform in JPEG 2000 Encoder","sourcePdf":"ttc2011050628.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.068298S","chronDate":"May  2011","isNumber":"5739139","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"8","articleId":"5669262","onlineDate":"17 December 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5669264,"authors":[{"name":"Miaoqing Huang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Computer Engineering, University of Arkansas, Fayetteville, AR, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/12/5779908/5669264/5669264-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Miaoqing Huang received the BS degree in electronics and information systems from Fudan University, China, in 1998, and the PhD degree in computer engineering from The George Washington University in 2009.

At CHES 1999, Tenca and Ko\u00e7 proposed the Multiple-Word Radix-2 Montgomery Multiplication (MWR2MM) algorithm and introduced a now-classic architecture for implementing Montgomery multiplication in hardware. With parameters optimized for minimum latency, this architecture performs a single Montgomery multiplication in approximately 2n clock cycles, where n is the size of operands in bits. In this paper, we propose two new hardware architectures that are able to perform the same operation in approximately n clock cycles with almost the same clock period. These two architectures are based on precomputing partial results using two possible assumptions regarding the most significant bit of the previous word. These two architectures outperform the original architecture of Tenca and Ko\u00e7 in terms of the product latency times area by 23 and 50 percent, respectively, for several most common operand sizes used in cryptography. The architecture in radix-2 can be extended to the case of radix-4, while preserving a factor of two speedup over the corresponding radix-4 design by Tenca, Todorov, and Ko\u00e7 from CHES 2001. Our optimization has been verified by modeling it using Verilog-HDL, implementing it on Xilinx Virtex-II 6000 FPGA, and experimentally testing it using SRC-6 reconfigurable computer.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5669264/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 December 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2011","volume":"60","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"31 May 2011","publicationDate":"July 2011","accessionNumber":"12031642","htmlLink":"/document/5669264/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"New Hardware Architectures for Montgomery Modular Multiplication Algorithm","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"New Hardware Architectures for Montgomery Modular Multiplication Algorithm","sourcePdf":"ttc2011070923.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.080364S","chronDate":"July  2011","xplore-pub-id":"12","isNumber":"5779908","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"64","xplore-issue":"5779908","articleId":"5669264","onlineDate":"17 December 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5669267,"authors":[{"name":"Woochul Kang","affiliation":["Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute, Daejeon, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/12/6085621/5669267/5669267-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Woochul Kang received the PhD degree from the University of Virginia in 2009.

Currently, databases for embedded systems are best effort, providing no guarantees on their timeliness and data freshness. Existing real-time database (RTDB) technology cannot be applied to these embedded databases since it hypothesizes that the main memory of a system is large enough to hold the entire database. This, however, might not be true in data-intensive real-time applications. QeDB uses a novel feedback control scheme to support QoS in such embedded systems without requiring all data to reside in main memory. In particular, our approach is based on simultaneous control of both I/O and CPU resources to guarantee the desired timeliness. Unlike existing work on feedback control of RTDB performance, we implement and evaluate the proposed scheme on a modern embedded device. The experimental results show that our approach supports the desired timeliness of transactions while still maintaining high data freshness compared to baseline approaches.","doi":"10.1109/TC.2010.240","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/12/6085621/05669267.pdf","startPage":"45","endPage":"59","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.2010.240","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6085621","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design, Implementation, and Evaluation of a QoS-Aware Real-Time Embedded Database","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5669267/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 December 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2012","displayDocTitle":"Design, Implementation, and Evaluation of a QoS-Aware Real-Time Embedded Database","volume":"61","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2012","accessionNumber":"12388237","htmlLink":"/document/5669267/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"28 November 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design, Implementation, and Evaluation of a QoS-Aware Real-Time Embedded Database","sourcePdf":"ttc2012010045.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.160774S","chronDate":"Jan.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"12","isNumber":"6085621","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"6085621","articleId":"5669267","onlineDate":"17 December 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5669268,"authors":[{"name":"Ashkan Hosseinzadeh Namin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Ashkan","lastName":"Hosseinzadeh Namin","id":"37294693900"},{"name":"Huapeng Wu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Windsor, Windsor, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Huapeng","lastName":"Wu","id":"37292237900"},{"name":"Majid Ahmadi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Windsor, Windsor, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Majid","lastName":"Ahmadi","id":"37276374600"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9340"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9956"},{"format":"CD","value":"2326-3814"}],"articleNumber":"5669268","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":20,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":607},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Niobium","Logic gates","Computer architecture","Complexity theory","Polynomials","Hardware","Clocks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["circuit complexity","digital arithmetic","public key cryptography"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["word-level finite field multiplier","d clock cycles","optimal normal basis","circuit complexities"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Finite field multiplier","normal basis","optimal normal basis","elliptic curve cryptography."]}],"abstract":"Hardware implementations of finite field arithmetic using normal basis are advantageous due to the fact that the squaring operation can be done at almost no cost.

The proposed architecture takes d clock cycles to compute the product bits, where the value for d, 1 \u2264 d \u2264 m, can be arbitrarily selected by the designer to set the tradeoff between area and speed. When there exists an optimal normal basis, it is shown that the proposed design has a smaller critical path delay than other word-level normal basis multipliers found in the literature, while its circuit complexities are moderate and comparable to the others. Different word size multipliers were implemented in hardware, and implementation results are also presented.","doi":"10.1109/TC.2010.235","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/12/5754649/05669268.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.2010.235","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5754649","startPage":"890","endPage":"895","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Word-Level Finite Field Multiplier Using Normal Basis","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5669268","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Word-Level Finite Field Multiplier Using Normal Basis","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5669268/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 December 2010","isJournal":true,"volume":"60","issue":"6","publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"11960634","dateOfInsertion":"21 April 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5669268/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Word-Level Finite Field Multiplier Using Normal Basis","sourcePdf":"ttc2011060890.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.076952S","chronDate":"June  2011","xplore-pub-id":"12","isNumber":"5754649","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"5754649","articleId":"5669268","onlineDate":"17 December 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5669272,"authors":[{"name":"Irem Tumer","affiliation":["School of Mechanical, Industrial, and Manufacturing Engineering, Oregon State University, Corvallis, OR, USA"],"firstName":"Irem","lastName":"Tumer","id":"38329076500"},{"name":"Carol Smidts","affiliation":["Mechanical Engineering Department, Ohio State Uinversity, Columbus, OH, USA"],"firstName":"Carol","lastName":"Smidts","id":"37299308600"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9340"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9956"},{"format":"CD","value":"2326-3814"}],"articleNumber":"5669272","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":32,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1325},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Software","Hardware","Reliability engineering","Software reliability","Analytical models","Redundancy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["aerospace computing","hardware-software codesign","safety-critical software","space vehicles"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["design-stage failure analysis","software-driven hardware systems","software-driven hardware configuration","safety-critical complex systems","software component","product life cycle","high-level system modeling","model-based reasoning approach","failure propagation model","function-failure identification and propagation analysis","FFIP analysis framework","reaction control system jet selection","NASA space shuttle","redundancy management system"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Integrated design-stage analysis","software-hardware reliability","formalisms","failure propagation analysis","safety-critical systems."]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5669272","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/12/5929503/05669272.pdf","startPage":"1072","endPage":"1084","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.2010.245","doi":"10.1109/TC.2010.245","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5929503","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Integrated Design-Stage Failure Analysis of Software-Driven Hardware Systems","abstract":"Software-driven hardware configurations account for the majority of modern safety-critical complex systems. The often costly failures of such systems can be attributed to software specific, hardware specific, or software/hardware interaction failures. The understanding of how failures propagate in such complex systems might provide critical information to designers, because, while a software component may not fail in terms of loss of function, a software operational state can cause an associated hardware failure. The least expensive phase of the product life cycle to address failures is during the design stage. This research presents a means to evaluate how a combined software/hardware system behaves and how such failures propagate to result in potential failures downstream, during the conceptual design stage. In particular, this paper proposes the use of high-level system modeling and model-based reasoning approaches to model failure propagation in combined software-hardware systems, introducing the Function-Failure Identification and Propagation (FFIP) analysis framework to help formalize the design of safety-critical systems. The fact that the hardware and software designers do not share the same background, knowledge, methods, or language contributes significantly to software/hardware interaction failures. A high-level systems analysis method, such as FFIP, is geared toward the unification of language and modeling concepts and may help to more seamlessly bridge such a gap. The technique is applied to the design of the Reaction Control System Jet Selection of the NASA space shuttle to evaluate failure propagation within the Reaction Control System Jet selection, specifically for the redundancy management system. The paper concludes with the extensions and mappings to the software domain that are required for a truly integrated methodology.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5669272/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 December 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2011","volume":"60","issue":"8","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12072894","dateOfInsertion":"23 June 2011","publicationDate":"Aug. 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5669272/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Integrated Design-Stage Failure Analysis of Software-Driven Hardware Systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Integrated Design-Stage Failure Analysis of Software-Driven Hardware Systems","sourcePdf":"ttc2011081072.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.128159S","chronDate":"Aug.  2011","isNumber":"5929503","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"32","articleId":"5669272","onlineDate":"17 December 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5669274,"authors":[{"name":"Valeria Garofalo","affiliation":["Department of Biomedical, Electronic and Telecommunication Engineering, University of Napoli Federico II, Napoli, Italy"],"firstName":"Valeria","lastName":"Garofalo","id":"37543168600"},{"name":"Nicola Petra","affiliation":["Department of Biomedical, Electronic and Telecommunication Engineering, University of Napoli Federico II, Napoli, Italy"],"firstName":"Nicola","lastName":"Petra","id":"37268574900"},{"name":"Ettore Napoli","affiliation":["Department of Biomedical, Electronic and Telecommunication Engineering, University of Napoli Federico II, Napoli, Italy"],"firstName":"Ettore","lastName":"Napoli","id":"37268558100"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9340"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9956"},{"format":"CD","value":"2326-3814"}],"articleNumber":"5669274","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":17,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":641},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org"}],"abstract":"A truncated multiplier is a multiplier with two n bit operands that produces a n bit result. Truncated multipliers discard some of the partial products of a complete multiplier to trade off accuracy with hardware cost. Compared with a conventional multiplier, a truncated multiplier introduces an error on the output whose magnitude depends on the input bits. The maximum value of the error is hardly computable, since it isn't possible to test every possible input and nonexhaustive simulations are very unlikely to provide the actual maximum absolute error value. It is therefore extremely useful to develop methods that provide the maximum error for a truncated multiplier. This paper presents a closed form analytical calculation, for every bit width, of the maximum error for a previously proposed family of truncated multipliers. The considered family of truncated multipliers is particularly important since it is proved to be the design that gives the lowest mean square error for a given number of discarder partial products. With the contribution of this paper, the considered family of truncated multipliers is the only architecture that can be designed, for every bit width, using an analytical approach that allows the a priori knowledge of the maximum error.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Integrated circuits","Mean square error methods","Least squares approximation","Accuracy","Finite wordlength effects","Hardware","Silicon carbide"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital arithmetic","digital signal processing chips","least mean squares methods","multiplying circuits","signal processing equipment"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analytical calculation","truncated multiplier","minimum mean square error","hardware cost","nonexhaustive simulation","maximum absolute error value","lowest mean square error","partial product discarder","maximum error knowledge"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Multiplication","truncated multipliers","digital arithmetic","error compensation","error analysis","maximum error."]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5669274","doi":"10.1109/TC.2010.236","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/12/5962399/05669274.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.2010.236","startPage":"1366","endPage":"1371","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5962399","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analytical Calculation of the Maximum Error for a Family of Truncated Multipliers Providing Minimum Mean Square Error","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Analytical Calculation of the Maximum Error for a Family of Truncated Multipliers Providing Minimum Mean Square Error","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5669274/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 December 2010","volume":"60","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/5669274/","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"29 July 2011","publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12175364","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analytical Calculation of the Maximum Error for a Family of Truncated Multipliers Providing Minimum Mean Square Error","sourcePdf":"ttc2011091366.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.084731S","chronDate":"Sept.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"12","isNumber":"5962399","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"5962399","articleId":"5669274","onlineDate":"17 December 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":5669275,"authors":[{"name":"Eric P.

Traditional fault-tolerance techniques such as N-modular redundancy (NMR) employ deterministic error detection and correction, e.g., majority voter, and tend to be power hungry. This paper proposes soft NMR that nontrivially extends NMR by consciously exploiting error statistics caused by nanoscale artifacts in order to design robust and energy-efficient systems. In contrast to conventional NMR, soft NMR employs Bayesian detection techniques in the voter. Soft voter algorithms are obtained through optimization of appropriate application aware cost functions. Analysis indicates that, on average, soft NMR outperforms conventional NMR. Furthermore, unlike NMR, in many cases, soft NMR is able to generate a correct output even when all N replicas are in error. This increase in robustness is then traded-off through voltage scaling to achieve energy efficiency. The design of a discrete cosine transform (DCT) image coder is employed to demonstrate the benefits of the proposed technique. Simulations in a commercial 45 nm, 1.2 V, CMOS process show that soft NMR provides up to 10\u00d7 improvement in robustness, and 35 percent power savings over conventional NMR.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5669275/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 December 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2012","publicationDate":"March 2012","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5669275/","dateOfInsertion":"23 January 2012","accessionNumber":"12486981","volume":"61","issue":"3","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Soft N-Modular Redundancy","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Soft N-Modular Redundancy","sourcePdf":"ttc2012030323.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.100317S","chronDate":"March  2012","xplore-pub-id":"12","isNumber":"6136474","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"35","xplore-issue":"6136474","articleId":"5669275","onlineDate":"17 December 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5669284,"authors":[{"name":"Luis Entrena","affiliation":["Electronic Technology Department, Universidad Carlos III de Madrid, Madrid, Spain"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/12/6136474/5669284/5669284-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Luis Entrena received the MS degree from the Universidad de Valladolid, Spain, in 1998, and the PhD degree from the Universidad Polit\u00e9cnica de Madrid, Spain, in 1995.

In particular, the estimation of Single Event Transient (SET) effects for complex systems that include a microprocessor is challenging, due to the huge potential number of different faults and effects that must be considered, and the delay-dependent nature of SET effects. In this paper, we propose a multilevel FPGA emulation-based fault injection approach for evaluation of SET effects called AMUSE (Autonomous MUltilevel emulation system for Soft Error evaluation). This approach integrates Gate level and Register-Transfer level models of the circuit under test in a FPGA and is able to switch to the appropriate model as needed during emulation. Fault injection is performed at the Gate level, which provides delay accuracy, while fault propagation across clock cycles is performed at the Register-Transfer level for higher performance. Experimental results demonstrate that AMUSE can emulate soft error effects for complex circuits including microprocessors and memories, considering the real delays of an ASIC technology, and support massive fault injection campaigns, in the order of tens of millions of faults within acceptable time.","doi":"10.1109/TC.2010.262","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/12/6136474/05669284.pdf","startPage":"313","endPage":"322","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.2010.262","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6136474","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5669284","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Soft Error Sensitivity Evaluation of Microprocessors by Multilevel Emulation-Based Fault Injection","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Soft Error Sensitivity Evaluation of Microprocessors by Multilevel Emulation-Based Fault Injection","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5669284/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 December 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2012","volume":"61","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5669284/","dateOfInsertion":"23 January 2012","publicationDate":"March 2012","accessionNumber":"12486982","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Soft Error Sensitivity Evaluation of Microprocessors by Multilevel Emulation-Based Fault Injection","sourcePdf":"ttc2012030313.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.089613S","chronDate":"March  2012","xplore-pub-id":"12","isNumber":"6136474","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"79","xplore-issue":"6136474","articleId":"5669284","onlineDate":"17 December 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-25"},{"_id":5669291,"authors":[{"name":"Daniel Piso","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Computer Engineering, University of Santiago de Compostela, Spain"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/12/6029369/5669291/5669291-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Daniel Piso received the BS degree in physics from the University of Santiago de Compostela, in 2001, and the PhD degree, in 2009.

The algorithm is based on a new rounding method for division, square root, and their reciprocals that avoids the conventional remainder calculation in most of cases and improves previous proposals. The rounding decision is taken by checking the least significant bits of the output of the last Goldschmidt iteration without any other transformation. This helps to reduce the number of cases which need the calculation of the remainder. Additionally, we avoid the calculation of the remainder for most of those cases by using a remainder estimate that can be easily obtained from the Goldschmidt iteration. The calculation of the estimate is much simpler and less time consuming than the calculation of the remainder and this contributes to reducing the number of cases which need a large latency. The combination of both techniques allows us to define a variable latency algorithm which needs to compute the remainder in just nine percent of the total number of cases for reciprocal and division and in 12 percent for square root and square root reciprocal.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Equations","Approximation algorithms","Approximation methods","Mathematical model","Hardware","Accuracy","Computers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["floating point arithmetic","iterative methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["variable latency Goldschmidt algorithm","rounding method","remainder estimation","division","square root","reciprocals","bits checking","iteration method","square root reciprocal"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Goldschmidt algorithm","division","square root","reciprocal","square root reciprocal","rounding","variable latency."]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5669291","doi":"10.1109/TC.2010.269","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/12/6029369/05669291.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.2010.269","startPage":"1535","endPage":"1546","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6029369","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Variable Latency Goldschmidt Algorithm Based on a New Rounding Method and a Remainder Estimate","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Variable Latency Goldschmidt Algorithm Based on a New Rounding Method and a Remainder Estimate","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5669291/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 December 2010","volume":"60","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/5669291/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"26 September 2011","publicationDate":"Nov. 2011","accessionNumber":"12244796","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Variable Latency Goldschmidt Algorithm Based on a New Rounding Method and a Remainder Estimate","sourcePdf":"ttc2011111535.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.110173S","chronDate":"Nov.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"12","isNumber":"6029369","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6029369","articleId":"5669291","onlineDate":"17 December 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5669293,"authors":[{"name":"Earl E.

However, a better system performance, e.g., in terms of a lower overall frame loss ratio (FLR), can be achieved if BER and FDR are jointly optimized. In this paper, we propose a cross-layer optimization scheme called traffic-adaptive scheme for multicode CDMA operating over a time division multiple access (TDMA) channel. Based on the traffic condition and buffer status, this scheme employs a Markov Decision Process (MDP) to determine the optimal value of the maximum number of simultaneous data frames that can be transmitted in each time slot of a TDMA frame so as to minimize the overall FLR of the system. To facilitate implementation, we also propose an approximation scheme named the rate-adaptive scheme to reduce the computation cost. Simulation and analytical results show that both the traffic-adaptive scheme and rate-adaptive scheme can significantly reduce FLR, increase the system throughput, and optimize the packet access delay of the system. Furthermore, the rate-adaptive scheme can achieve a performance close to the traffic-adaptive scheme when the traffic load in the system is high.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/7755/5752265/05669316.pdf","startPage":"810","endPage":"820","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","doi":"10.1109/TMC.2010.230","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMC.2010.230","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5752265","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5669316","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cross-Layer Optimization for Multimedia Transport over Multicode CDMA Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Time division multiple access","Multimedia communication","Adaptation model","Optimization","Markov processes","Adaptive systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["approximation theory","code division multiple access","error statistics","Markov processes","multimedia communication","optimisation","telecommunication traffic","time division multiple access"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multimedia transport","multicode CDMA networks","code division multiple access","bit error ratio","BER","physical layer","frame drop ratio","medium access control layer","frame loss ratio","cross-layer optimization scheme","traffic-adaptive scheme","time division multiple access channel","Markov decision process","traffic condition","buffer status","time slot","TDMA frame","approximation scheme","rate-adaptive scheme","system throughput","packet access delay","traffic load"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Multimedia communication","wireless","multicode code division multiple access."]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5669316/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 December 2010","displayDocTitle":"Cross-Layer Optimization for Multimedia Transport over Multicode CDMA Networks","volume":"10","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/5669316/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"11960628","dateOfInsertion":"19 April 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cross-Layer Optimization for Multimedia Transport over Multicode CDMA Networks","sourcePdf":"ttm2011060810.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.076973S","chronDate":"June  2011","xplore-pub-id":"7755","isNumber":"5752265","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7755","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5752265","articleId":"5669316","onlineDate":"17 December 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5669318,"authors":[{"name":"Juzheng Li","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Illinois, Chicago, Chicago, IL, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7755/5752265/5669318/5669318-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Juzheng Li received the bachelor's degree in software engineering from the Harbin Institute of Technology, China.

Civilian vehicles or even human beings equipped with proper wireless communication devices can be used as mobile sinks that retrieve sensor-data from sampling points within a large sensor field. A key challenge is how to gather the sensor data in a manner that is energy efficient with respect to the sensor nodes that serve as sources of the sensor data. In this paper, an algorithmic technique called Band-based Directional Broadcast is introduced to control the direction of broadcasts that originate from sensor nodes. The goal is to direct each broadcast of sensor data toward the mobile sink, thus reducing costly forwarding of sensor data packets. The technique is studied by simulations that consider energy consumption and data deliverability.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Mobile communication","Mobile computing","Scheduling","Floods","Routing protocols","Routing","Receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mobile radio","protocols","signal sampling","telecommunication control","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mobile sampling","sensor field data","controlled broadcast","wireless communication devices","mobile sinks","sensor nodes","algorithmic technique","band-based directional broadcast","sensor data packet forwarding","energy consumption","energy-efficient protocol","sensor networks"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Sensor data sampling","mobile object","directional broadcast","sensor networks."]}],"doi":"10.1109/TMC.2010.233","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/7755/5752265/05669318.pdf","startPage":"881","endPage":"896","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5752265","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMC.2010.233","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Mobile Sampling of Sensor Field Data Using Controlled Broadcast","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5669318","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Mobile Sampling of Sensor Field Data Using Controlled Broadcast","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5669318/","volume":"10","issue":"6","publicationDate":"June 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5669318/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"11960629","dateOfInsertion":"19 April 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 December 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mobile Sampling of Sensor Field Data Using Controlled Broadcast","sourcePdf":"ttm2011060881.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.082353S","chronDate":"June  2011","xplore-pub-id":"7755","isNumber":"5752265","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7755","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"5752265","articleId":"5669318","onlineDate":"17 December 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5669332,"authors":[{"name":"Seshadri Kolluri","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California, Santa Barbara, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Seshadri","lastName":"Kolluri","id":"37604776100"},{"name":"David F.

Our geospatial information retrieval and indexing system, GeoIRIS, contains 45 GB of high-resolution satellite imagery. Objects of multiple scales are automatically extracted from satellite imagery and then encoded into a bitmap shape representation. This shape encoding compresses the total size of the shape descriptors to approximately 0.34% of the imagery database size. We have developed the entropy-balanced bitmap (EBB) tree, which exploits the probabilistic nature of bit values in automatically derived shape classes. The efficiency of the shape representation coupled with the EBB tree allows us to index approximately 1.3 million objects for fast content-based retrieval of objects by shape.","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2010.2088404","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel5/36/5753065/05669345.pdf","startPage":"1603","endPage":"1616","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2010.2088404","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5753065","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Entropy-Balanced Bitmap Tree for Shape-Based Object Retrieval From Large-Scale Satellite Imagery Databases","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5669345","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 December 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5669345/","displayDocTitle":"Entropy-Balanced Bitmap Tree for Shape-Based Object Retrieval From Large-Scale Satellite Imagery Databases","volume":"49","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 2011","accessionNumber":"11960952","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5669345/","dateOfInsertion":"21 April 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Entropy-Balanced Bitmap Tree for Shape-Based Object Retrieval From Large-Scale Satellite Imagery Databases","sourcePdf":"tgrs-shyu-2088404-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.085772S","chronDate":"May  2011","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"5753065","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"60","xplore-issue":"5753065","articleId":"5669345","onlineDate":"17 December 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-28"},{"_id":5669348,"authors":[{"name":"Jieru Chi","affiliation":["School of Automation Engineering, Qingdao University of China, Qingdao, China"],"firstName":"Jieru","lastName":"Chi","id":"37409527100"},{"name":"Feng Liu","affiliation":["School of Information Technology and Electrical Engineering, University of Queensland, QLD, Australia"],"firstName":"Feng","lastName":"Liu","id":"37275918700"},{"name":"Ling Xia","affiliation":["Department of Biomedical Engineering, University of Zhejiang, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Ling","lastName":"Xia","id":"37364665800"},{"name":"Tingting Shao","affiliation":["Department of Biomedical Engineering, University of Zhejiang, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Tingting","lastName":"Shao","id":"37595281100"},{"name":"Stuart Crozier","affiliation":["School of Information Technology and Electrical Engineering, University of Queensland, QLD, Australia"],"firstName":"Stuart","lastName":"Crozier","id":"37266520800"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9464"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0069"}],"articleNumber":"5669348","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":563},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Magnetics Society","url":"http://www.ieeemagnetics.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Finite difference methods","Time domain analysis","Numerical models","Magnetic resonance imaging","Coils","Computational modeling","Equations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biological tissues","biomagnetism","biomedical MRI","computational electromagnetics","finite difference time-domain analysis","medical computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cylindrical FDTD algorithm","field-tissue interaction study","MRI","cylindrical coordinates","numerical singularity","polar axis","singularity problem","Faraday law","Ampere law","commercial electromagnetic simulation package","high-frequency RF field-human body interactions","magnetic resonance imaging"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["FDTD methods","magnetic resonance imaging","numerical analysis"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents a three-dimensional finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) scheme in cylindrical coordinates with an improved algorithm for accommodating the numerical singularity associated with the polar axis.

Our structure can multiply two N \u00d7 M matrices, using one input and one bidirectional input/output data line.

The algorithm combines the near-state PWM (NSPWM) method that has superior overall performance characteristics at high modulation index, and MAZSPWM, a modified form of the active zero-state PWM method (AZSPWM1), which is suitable for low modulation index range of operation. Since AZSPWM1 has line-to-line voltage pulse reversals with small zero-voltage time intervals, in its naive form, it causes overvoltages, in particular in long-cable motor drive applications. Obtained by reorganizing the duty cycles of the utilized voltage vectors of AZSPWM1, MAZSPWM has sufficiently long zero-voltage time intervals between pulse reversals such that during pulse reversals, overvoltages are avoided. The combined algorithm performs satisfactorily throughout the inverter operating range and the transition from NSPWM to MAZSPWM and vice versa is seamless. The performance of the proposed algorithm is proven by theory, computer simulations, and detailed laboratory experiments. The paper also shows that the proposed reduced CMV PWM algorithm is effective in reducing the motor leakage current, and it is most beneficial when a small common-mode inductor is included in the drive.","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2010.2100100","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/63/5975345/05669355.pdf","startPage":"1998","endPage":"2008","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2010.2100100","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5975345","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A High-Performance PWM Algorithm for Common-Mode Voltage Reduction in Three-Phase Voltage Source Inverters","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5669355","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 December 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5669355/","displayDocTitle":"A High-Performance PWM Algorithm for Common-Mode Voltage Reduction in Three-Phase Voltage Source Inverters","volume":"26","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 2011","accessionNumber":"12205317","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5669355/","dateOfInsertion":"04 August 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A High-Performance PWM Algorithm for Common-Mode Voltage Reduction in Three-Phase Voltage Source Inverters","sourcePdf":"tpel-hava-2100100-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.10619S","chronDate":"July  2011","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"5975345","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"178","xplore-issue":"5975345","articleId":"5669355","onlineDate":"17 December 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-28"},{"_id":5669357,"authors":[{"name":"Haiyang Ding","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Integrated Service Networks, Xidian University, Xi'an, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/5713041/5669357/5669357-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Haiyang Ding was born in Hebei Province, China, in 1980.

First, we consider a scenario where perfect channel state information (CSI) is available. For these scenarios, the respective asymptotic outage behaviors of the secondary systems are analyzed, from which the diversity and coding gains are derived and compared. Unlike the coding gain, which is shown to be very sensitive with the position of the primary receiver, the diversity gain of the secondary system is the same as the nonspectrum-sharing system. In addition, depending on the cooperative strategy employed, an increase in the number of relays may lead to severe loss of the coding gain. Afterwards, the impacts of imperfect CSI regarding the interference and transmit channels on the outage behavior of the secondary systems are analyzed. On one hand, the imperfect CSI concerning the interference channels only affects the outage performance of the primary system, whereas it has no effect on the diversity gain of the secondary system. On the other hand, the imperfect CSI concerning the transmit channels of the secondary systems may reduce the diversity gain of the three relay-selection strategies to unity, which is validated by both theoretical and numerical results.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5669357/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 December 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2011","publicationDate":"Feb. 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5669357/","dateOfInsertion":"14 February 2011","accessionNumber":"11807416","volume":"60","issue":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Asymptotic Analysis of Cooperative Diversity Systems With Relay Selection in a Spectrum-Sharing Scenario","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Asymptotic Analysis of Cooperative Diversity Systems With Relay Selection in a Spectrum-Sharing Scenario","sourcePdf":"tvt-ding-2100053-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.090593S","chronDate":"Feb.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"5713041","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"128","xplore-issue":"5713041","articleId":"5669357","onlineDate":"17 December 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5669363,"authors":[{"name":"Antonius Yudi Sendjaja","affiliation":["School of Chemical Biomedical Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/9424/5762835/5669363/5669363-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Antonius Yudi Sendjaja received the B.S. degree in chemical engineering from the University of Indonesia, Kampus UI Depok, in 2006.

A control system is needed for SOFCs to meet operational objectives and ensure safe operation. Previous studies showed that the control of SOFC is challenging due to its slow response time, tight operating constraints and unavailability of some key measurements. In this work, simple yet reliable decentralized proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controllers are systematically designed based on a benchmark nonlinear dynamic model of SOFC . The design procedure involves selection of controlled variables (CVs), input-output pairing selection, and PID controller tuning. For CV selection, a novel method is proposed such that maintaining the CVs at constant setpoints facilitates constraint satisfaction for all key variables. Closed-loop simulations demonstrate that the proposed decentralized PI controllers are able to closely meet the control objectives of SOFC even in the presence of changing operating conditions.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 December 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5669363/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2011","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"7","issue":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 2011","dateOfInsertion":"05 May 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5669363/","accessionNumber":"11973974","displayDocTitle":"Decentralized Control of Solid Oxide Fuel Cells","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Decentralized Control of Solid Oxide Fuel Cells","sourcePdf":"tii-kariwala-2097601-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.199441S","chronDate":"May  2011","xplore-pub-id":"9424","isNumber":"5762835","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9424","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"5762835","articleId":"5669363","onlineDate":"17 December 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-19"},{"_id":5669365,"authors":[{"name":"Alaaeddine Ramadan","affiliation":["XLIM Laboratory, University of Limoges, Limoges, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/5730005/5669365/5669365-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Alaaeddine Ramadan was born in Barja, Lebanon, on March 7, 1985.

Partitioning a larger die into smaller segments and then stacking them in a 3D integration can significantly reduce latency and energy consumption. Such benefits emanate from the notion that inter-wafer distances are negligible compared to intra-wafer distances which substantially reduce global wiring length in 3D chips. This progress has introduced novel architectures and new challenges for high-performance power-aware design exploration. In this paper, we outline the opportunities and challenges associated with three-dimensional networks-on-chip architectures, under consideration for different design metrics.

The studied techniques illustrate the trade-off in terms of noise-shaper and DAC implementation complexity and loss in SNR. It is found that a fair amount of improvement in SNR is achieved by maintaining low-complexity of noise shaper. The complexity of the subDAC is yet a parameter, directly related to the number of output bits from the noise shaper. Two different architectures are investigated with respect to subDAC complexity and noise shaper complexity. It is shown that the required number of DAC unit elements (DUE) can be reduced to half.","doi":"10.1109/NORCHIP.2010.5669461","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NORCHIP.2010.5669461","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","displayPublicationTitle":"NORCHIP 2010","pdfPath":"/iel5/5661642/5669423/05669461.pdf","publicationTitle":"NORCHIP 2010","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5669423","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Study of modified noise-shaper architectures for oversampled sigma-delta DACs","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"15-16 Nov. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Study of modified noise-shaper architectures for oversampled sigma-delta DACs","conferenceDate":"15-16 Nov. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"17 December 2010","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5669461/","accessionNumber":"11698887","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5669461/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Study of modified noise-shaper architectures for oversampled sigma-delta DACs","confLoc":"Tampere, Finland","sourcePdf":"48.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045498S","chronDate":"15-16 Nov. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5661642","isNumber":"5669423","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5661642","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5669423","articleId":"5669461","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5669465,"authors":[{"name":"Toru Taniguchi","affiliation":["Laboratory, Research & Development Center, Japan Radio Company Limited, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Toru","lastName":"Taniguchi","id":"37399793500"},{"name":"Kazuya Kojima","affiliation":["Laboratory, Research & Development Center, Japan Radio Company Limited, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Kazuya","lastName":"Kojima","id":"37400019900"},{"name":"Akira Matsuzawa","affiliation":["Department of Physical Electronics, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Akira","lastName":"Matsuzawa","id":"37328684600"},{"name":"Kouji Matsunaga","affiliation":["System IP Core Research Laboratories, NEC Corporation Limited, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Kouji","lastName":"Matsunaga","id":"37602304500"},{"name":"Yasutake Hirachi","affiliation":["Ammsys, Inc., Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Yasutake","lastName":"Hirachi","id":"37299438400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8973-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8972-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8971-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5669465","dbTime":"19 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":104},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["System-on-a-chip","Bit error rate","Jitter","MMICs","Wireless communication","Quadrature amplitude modulation","Throughput"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["jitter","millimetre wave devices","modems","quadrature amplitude modulation","system-on-chip"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["SoC","RF hardware","ultra high speed multi level QAM modem","gigabit Ethernet interface","millimeter wave broadband wireless system","internal clock jitter","frequency 38 GHz","frequency 200 MHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Broadband","Wireless","Millimeter wave","Multi level QAM","I/Q modulation","SoC","single carrier","TDD"]}],"abstract":"Since 2008, we have been developing the integrated SoC, which incorporates from the ultra high speed multi-level QAM modem to the gigabit Ethernet interface, in a bid to adapt to the millimeter wave broadband wireless system.

Our research is focused on partitioning the vision processing tasks between Senor node and central base station. In this paper we have added the exploration dimension to perform some of the vision tasks such as image capturing, background subtraction, segmentation and Tiff Group4 compression on FPGA while communication on microcontroller. The remaining vision processing tasks i.e. morphology, labeling, bubble remover and classification are processed on central base station. Our results show that the introduction of FPGA for some of the visual tasks will result in a longer life time for the visual sensor node while the architecture is still programmable.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NORCHIP.2010.5669490","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5669423","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","displayPublicationTitle":"NORCHIP 2010","pdfPath":"/iel5/5661642/5669423/05669490.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Exploration of target architecture for a wireless camera based sensor node","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5669490/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-16 Nov. 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5669490/","displayDocTitle":"Exploration of target architecture for a wireless camera based sensor node","conferenceDate":"15-16 Nov. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2010","accessionNumber":"11698916","dateOfInsertion":"17 December 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Exploration of target architecture for a wireless camera based sensor node","confLoc":"Tampere, Finland","sourcePdf":"102.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.105061S","chronDate":"15-16 Nov. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5661642","isNumber":"5669423","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5661642","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"5669423","articleId":"5669490","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5669494,"authors":[{"name":"Cl\u00e9ment Foucher","affiliation":["Laboratoire d \u00c9lectronique, Antennes et T\u00e9l\u00e9communications (LEAT), Universit\u00e9 de Nice-Sophia Antipolis, La Valbonne, France"],"firstName":"Cl\u00e9ment","lastName":"Foucher","id":"37597292800"},{"name":"Fabrice Muller","affiliation":["Laboratoire d \u00c9lectronique, Antennes et T\u00e9l\u00e9communications (LEAT), Universit\u00e9 de Nice-Sophia Antipolis, La Valbonne, France"],"firstName":"Fabrice","lastName":"Muller","id":"37287192700"},{"name":"Alain Giulieri","affiliation":["Laboratoire d \u00c9lectronique, Antennes et T\u00e9l\u00e9communications (LEAT), Universit\u00e9 de Nice-Sophia Antipolis, La Valbonne, France"],"firstName":"Alain","lastName":"Giulieri","id":"37545654700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8973-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8972-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8971-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5669494","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":149},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Exploring FPGAs capability to host a HPC design","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5669494","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computer architecture","Microprocessors","Field programmable gate arrays","Hardware","Benchmark testing","Kernel"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","parallel processing","reconfigurable architectures"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FPGA","HPC design","reconfigurable hardware","reconfigurable computing","high performance computer node","parallel program communication","static softcore","Xilinx Virtex 5"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["FPGA","Architecture Exploration","High Performance Reconfigurable Computing"]}],"abstract":"Reconfigurable hardware is now used in high performance computers, introducing the high performance reconfigurable computing. Dynamic hardware allows processors to devolve intensive computations to dedicated hardware circuitry optimized for that purpose. Our aim is to make larger use of hardware capabilities by pooling the hardware and software computations resources in a unified design in order to allow replacing the ones by the others depending on the application needs. For that purpose, we needed a test platform to evaluate FPGA capabilities to operate as a high performance computer node. We designed an architecture allowing the separation of a parallel program communication from its kernels computation in order to make easier the future partial dynamic reconfiguration of the processing elements. This architecture implements static softcores as test IPs, keeping in mind that the future platform implementing dynamic reconfiguration will allow changing the processing elements. In this paper, we present this test architecture and its implementation upon Xilinx Virtex 5 FPGAs. We then present a benchmark of the platform using the NAS parallel benchmark integer sort in order to compare various use cases.","doi":"10.1109/NORCHIP.2010.5669494","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NORCHIP.2010.5669494","publicationTitle":"NORCHIP 2010","displayPublicationTitle":"NORCHIP 2010","pdfPath":"/iel5/5661642/5669423/05669494.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5669423","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5669494/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-16 Nov. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Exploring FPGAs capability to host a HPC design","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"15-16 Nov. 2010","accessionNumber":"11698920","htmlLink":"/document/5669494/","dateOfInsertion":"17 December 2010","publicationDate":"Nov. 2010","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Exploring FPGAs capability to host a HPC design","confLoc":"Tampere, Finland","sourcePdf":"1.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038459S","chronDate":"15-16 Nov. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5661642","isNumber":"5669423","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5661642","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5669423","articleId":"5669494","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5669512,"authors":[{"name":"Abdullah Chami","affiliation":["Department of Complex Systems Science, Graduate School of Information Science, University of Nagoya, Nagoya, Japan"],"firstName":"Abdullah","lastName":"Chami","id":"37411562800"},{"name":"Nader Rajaei","affiliation":["Department of Complex Systems Science, Graduate School of Information Science, University of Nagoya, Nagoya, Japan"],"firstName":"Nader","lastName":"Rajaei","id":"37597808300"},{"name":"Hanafiah Bin Yussof","affiliation":["Universiti Teknologi MARA, Fukuroi, Japan"],"lastName":"Hanafiah Bin Yussof","id":"37597807900"},{"name":"Masahiro Ohka","affiliation":["Department of Complex Systems Science, Graduate School of Information Science, University of Nagoya, Nagoya, Japan"],"firstName":"Masahiro","lastName":"Ohka","id":"37295081900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7997-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7995-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-7996-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5669512","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":99},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Analytical models","Biological system modeling","Adaptation model"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["finite element analysis","haptic interfaces"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["velvet hand illusion","FEM analysis","haptic illusion","VHI","haptic display","tactile display"]}],"abstract":"We reveal the reason behind a haptic illusion called the Velvet Hand Illusion (VHI) by FEM analysis. We also investigate the possibility of using the results of the analysis to design a haptic display which utilize VHI. In VHI, a person rubs his/her hands together on both sides of wires strung through a frame and produces the sensation of rubbing a very smooth and soft surface like velvet. We focus on VHI to determine the specifications of an actuator for a tactile display enhanced by VHI. A simulated fingertip is modeled under the same contact condition that an actual finger is believed to undergo when under VHI. We collected the simulated responses of a number of SAI afferents, which are responsible for detecting the edges, to relate them to the mechanism of the illusion. Even with a simple model that treats only one finger, we noticed a considerable difference between the responses of a number of SAI receptors compared with that of a fingertip touching wires without the effect of the opposing finger. The SAI responses for the VHI case are less (some receptors' response is up to 50% less) than those for a finger touching the wires, which corresponds to a decrease of the perception of the wires. SAI might play a role in the mechanism of the VHI illusion. This study could benefit the development of a haptic display that utilizes the illusion and makes a person experience the same feeling using the proposed display.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Investigation on mechanism of Velvet Hand Illusion using FEM analysis","publicationTitle":"2010 International Symposium on Micro-NanoMechatronics and Human Science","doi":"10.1109/MHS.2010.5669512","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Symposium on Micro-NanoMechatronics and Human Science","pdfPath":"/iel5/5658189/5669496/05669512.pdf","startPage":"414","endPage":"419","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MHS.2010.5669512","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5669496","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5669512","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5669512/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Nov. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Investigation on mechanism of Velvet Hand Illusion using FEM analysis","conferenceDate":"7-10 Nov. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5669512/","dateOfInsertion":"17 December 2010","publicationDate":"Nov. 2010","accessionNumber":"11703457","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Investigation on mechanism of Velvet Hand Illusion using FEM analysis","confLoc":"Nagoya, Japan","sourcePdf":"11TP225.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048644S","chronDate":"7-10 Nov. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5658189","isNumber":"5669496","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5658189","xplore-issue":"5669496","articleId":"5669512","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5669581,"authors":[{"name":"Li Jing-Chun","affiliation":["Department of Animal Science, Graduate School of Natural Sciences and Technologies, Okayama University, Okayama, Japan"],"lastName":"Li Jing-Chun","id":"38273435700"},{"name":"Koji Matsuura","affiliation":["Research Core for Interdisciplinary Sciences, Okayama University, Okayama, Japan"],"firstName":"Koji","lastName":"Matsuura","id":"37587288800"},{"name":"Yuka Kuroda","affiliation":["Research Core for Interdisciplinary Sciences, Okayama University, Okayama, Japan"],"firstName":"Yuka","lastName":"Kuroda","id":"37596064100"},{"name":"Hiroaki Funahashi","affiliation":["Department of Animal Science, Graduate School of Natural Sciences and Technologies, Okayama University, Okayama, Japan"],"firstName":"Hiroaki","lastName":"Funahashi","id":"38271280900"},{"name":"Keiji Naruse","affiliation":["Cardiovascular Physiology, Graduate School of Medicine, Dentistry and Pharmaceutical, Okayama University, Okayama, Japan"],"firstName":"Keiji","lastName":"Naruse","id":"37295320800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7997-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7995-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-7996-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5669581","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":90},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fluids","Microfluidics","Biomembranes","Embryo"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biological fluid dynamics","biomembranes","bioMEMS","friction","gynaecology","medical control systems","microactuators","microfluidics","polymers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mechanical stimuli","microfluidic air actuating system","cultured mammalian embryos","shear stress","compression","friction force","fallopian tube","nidation","fluid dynamics","oviduct","microfluidic channels","poly(dimethylsiloxiane) membrane"]}],"abstract":"Mammalian embryos experience not only hormonal but also mechanical stimuli, such as shear stress, compression, and friction force, in the fallopian tube before nidation. We aim to develop a novel and simple system to apply mechanical stimuli (MS) similar to those generated inside the oviduct to cultured mammalian embryos. Possible MS include shear stress (SS) caused by fluid dynamics and compression of embryos due to interactions with the wall of the oviduct. A new culture system was developed to increase SS and to apply MS during in vitro embryo cultures. We developed an air actuating system with microfluidic channels to apply MS by deforming a 0.1-mm-thick poly(dimethylsiloxiane) membrane and evaluated MS applied to ICR mouse embryos inside the microfluidic channel. Using this air actuating system, we applied compression to mouse embryos inside the medium channel and estimated SS on the basis of the velocity of the embryos' motion. By changing the syringe velocity, we applied different types of MS to the embryos. These results suggested that multiple MS such as SS and compression can be applied at the same time. MS applied using this system was similar to those generated in the physiological environment of the oviduct.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Application of mechanical stimuli using a microfluidic air actuating system to cultured mammalian embryos","publicationTitle":"2010 International Symposium on Micro-NanoMechatronics and Human Science","doi":"10.1109/MHS.2010.5669581","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Symposium on Micro-NanoMechatronics and Human Science","pdfPath":"/iel5/5658189/5669496/05669581.pdf","startPage":"29","endPage":"34","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MHS.2010.5669581","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5669496","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5669581","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5669581/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Nov. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Application of mechanical stimuli using a microfluidic air actuating system to cultured mammalian embryos","conferenceDate":"7-10 Nov. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5669581/","dateOfInsertion":"17 December 2010","publicationDate":"Nov. 2010","accessionNumber":"11699274","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Application of mechanical stimuli using a microfluidic air actuating system to cultured mammalian embryos","confLoc":"Nagoya, Japan","sourcePdf":"02MP15.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.089077S","chronDate":"7-10 Nov. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5658189","isNumber":"5669496","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5658189","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5669496","articleId":"5669581","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5669626,"authors":[{"name":"Shao-I Chu","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, I-Shou University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Shao-I","lastName":"Chu","id":"37595570600"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"5669626","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":29,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1229},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Fading","Signal to noise ratio","Diversity methods","Approximation methods","Performance analysis","Numerical models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplify and forward communication","cooperative communication","diversity reception","Nakagami channels","telecommunication network routing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplify and forward cooperative communications","best relay selection","Nakagami-m fading channels","asymptotic symbol error rate","diversity gain","approximation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Amplify-and-forward (AF)","best relay","symbol error rate (SER)","Nakagami-m fading"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5669626","abstract":"This letter derives the asymptotic symbol error rate (SER) of amplify-and-forward (AF) cooperative communications with the N\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">th</sup>\n best-relay scheme over independent and non-identical Nakagami-m fading channels.

More specifically, each BS broadcasts its pre-designed interference directions, e.g., orthonormal random vectors, to all the users in other cells. Then, each user computes the amount of its generating interference, affecting the other BSs, and feedbacks it to its home cell BS.

This research incorporates such an intelligent information processing mechanism, and applies it to an autonomous agent that has three main functions that is, learning, memorization and associative recollection. In the proposed system, an actor-critic type reinforcement learning method is used for learning. For memorization, we introduce the chaotic auto-associative model that is proposed by Chartier, and that is also used like mutual associative memory system. Moreover, to deal with the increase of information, the memory part has an adaptive hierarchical layered structure of the memory module that consists of chaotic neural networks, especially for multi-valued pattern. Finally, the effectiveness of this proposed method is verified through the simulation applied to the maze-searching problem.","doi":"10.1109/ICCAS.2010.5669888","startPage":"176","endPage":"181","publicationTitle":"ICCAS 2010","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCAS.2010.5669888","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5669634","displayPublicationTitle":"ICCAS 2010","pdfPath":"/iel5/5656240/5669634/05669888.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A reinforcement learning system embedded agent with neural network-based multi-valued pattern memory structure","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5669888/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A reinforcement learning system embedded agent with neural network-based multi-valued pattern memory structure","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5669888/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11702863","publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"17 December 2010","conferenceDate":"27-30 Oct. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 Oct. 2010","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A reinforcement learning system embedded agent with neural network-based multi-valued pattern memory structure","confLoc":"Gyeonggi-do, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"TA074.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055828S","chronDate":"27-30 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5656240","isNumber":"5669634","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5656240","xplore-issue":"5669634","articleId":"5669888","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE International Conference on Control & Automation","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5669913,"authors":[{"name":"Junhee Jung","affiliation":["School of Information and Communication Engineering, Sungkyunkwan University, Suwon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Junhee","lastName":"Jung","id":"37598628500"},{"name":"Seunghun Jin","affiliation":["School of Information and Communication Engineering, Sungkyunkwan University, Suwon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Seunghun","lastName":"Jin","id":"37290425800"},{"name":"Dongkyun Kim","affiliation":["School of Information and Communication Engineering, Sungkyunkwan University, Suwon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Dongkyun","lastName":"Kim","id":"38560145900"},{"name":"Hyung Soon Kim","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Pusan University, busan, South Korea"],"firstName":"Hyung Soon","lastName":"Kim","id":"37280364400"},{"name":"Jong Suk Choi","affiliation":["Advanced Robotics Research Center, Korea Institute of Science and Technology, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jong Suk","lastName":"Choi","id":"37292544300"},{"name":"Jae Wook Jeon","affiliation":["School of Information and Communication Engineering, Sungkyunkwan University, Suwon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jae Wook","lastName":"Jeon","id":"37295879900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-89-93215-02-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7453-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5669913","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":528},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Noise","Speech recognition","Speech","Speech processing","Robustness","Hardware"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["speech coding","speech recognition","voice equipment"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["voice activity detection system","FPGA","degree of voicing","quantile signal-to-noise ratio","signal capturing","dual port RAM","speech processing","speech coding","speech recognition","time 15 ms"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Speech Processing","Voice Activity Detection","DoV","QSNR","FPGA","VHDL","Hardware Design"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we present a FPGA-based voice activity detection system.
