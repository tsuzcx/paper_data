The proposed algorithm is broad in its applicability and generalizes previous results.

Simple model simplifications are introduced to allow the use of linear programming in conjunction with a receding horizon implementation for multi-vehicle path planning. Stochastic models based on the current position of opposing vehicles are used to describe their possible future trajectories. The utility of the LP-based algorithm is tested in the RoboFlag drill, where both teams of vehicles have equal path planning capabilities using the proposed algorithm. Results show that the LP-based path planning in combination with a simple enemy model can be used for efficient multi-vehicle path planning in an adversarial environment.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2005, American Control Conference, 2005.","pdfPath":"/iel5/9861/31519/01470103.pdf","startPage":"1072","endPage":"1077 vol. 2","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2005, American Control Conference, 2005.","doi":"10.1109/ACC.2005.1470103","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACC.2005.1470103","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31519","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1470103","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Linear-programming-based multi-vehicle path planning with adversaries","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Path planning","Unmanned aerial vehicles","Remotely operated vehicles","Resource management","Testing","Mobile robots","Linear programming","Stochastic processes","Predictive models","Aerospace engineering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["linear programming","multi-robot systems","path planning","mobile robots","resource allocation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["linear programming","multi-vehicle path planning","autonomous vehicles","adversarial environment","resource allocation","RoboFlag drill"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1470103/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 June 2005","displayDocTitle":"Linear-programming-based multi-vehicle path planning with adversaries","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1470103/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8589005","dateOfInsertion":"01 August 2005","conferenceDate":"8-10 June 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Linear-programming-based multi-vehicle path planning with adversaries","confLoc":"Portland, OR, USA","sourcePdf":"01470103.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06356S","chronDate":"8-10 June 2005","xplore-pub-id":"9861","isNumber":"31519","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9861","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"31519","articleId":"1470103","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"American Automatic Control Council","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":1470117,"authors":[{"name":"Bin Zhang","affiliation":["School of EEE, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"lastName":"Bin Zhang","id":"37087254328"},{"name":"Keliang Zhou","affiliation":["Faculty of EWI, Delft University of Technnology, Delft, Netherlands"],"lastName":"Keliang Zhou","id":"37087252944"},{"name":"Yongqiang Ye","affiliation":["School of Information, Zhejiang University of Finance and Economics, Hangzhou, China"],"lastName":"Yongqiang Ye","id":"37087253030"},{"name":"Danwei Wang","affiliation":["Faculty of School of EEE, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"lastName":"Danwei Wang","id":"37087172215"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-9098-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"0-7803-9099-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0743-1619"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2378-5861"}],"articleNumber":"1470117","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":206},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of linear phase lead repetitive control for CVCF PWM DC-AC converters","abstract":"A linear phase lead repetitive controller is introduced for the constant-voltage constant-frequency (CVCF) pulse-width modulated (PWM) DC-AC converters.

During the maneuvering mode of a target, estimation accuracy of the tracker is typically worse than that during the constant velocity (benign motion) mode. Hence it is desired to have higher sampling rate during the maneuvering mode and relatively lower sampling rate for the benign motion mode. In the proposed adaptive sampling policy, we predict an expected cost function for a candidate sampling interval selected from a predefined set of sampling intervals. We then choose the largest sampling interval for which an expected performance metric is satisfied. We use a random sampling approach coupled-with switching multiple kinematic models for target motion, to generate future (pseudo-)measurements which allows computation of the relevant performance metric. The algorithm is illustrated via a simulation example involving tracking of a maneuvering target in presence of clutter and two sensors (radar and sonar). Multisensor tracking is achieved by a suboptimal filtering algorithm developed by the interacting multiple model (IMM) filtering approach combined with the probabilistic data association (PDA) technique and with the proposed adaptive sampling scheme.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sampling methods","Target tracking","Adaptive filters","Radar tracking","Personal digital assistants","Filtering","Measurement","Motion estimation","Cost function","Kinematics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sampling methods","sensor fusion","target tracking","filtering theory","radar clutter","radar tracking"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive sampling","multisensor tracking","maneuvering target","benign motion mode","random sampling","switching multiple kinematic model","clutter","interacting multiple model filtering","probabilistic data association filtering"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ACC.2005.1470138","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2005, American Control Conference, 2005.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2005, American Control Conference, 2005.","pdfPath":"/iel5/9861/31519/01470138.pdf","startPage":"1263","endPage":"1268 vol. 2","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31519","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACC.2005.1470138","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On adaptive sampling for multisensor tracking of a maneuvering target using IMM/PDA filtering","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1470138","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"On adaptive sampling for multisensor tracking of a maneuvering target using IMM/PDA filtering","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1470138/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2005","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1470138/","accessionNumber":"8589039","conferenceDate":"8-10 June 2005","dateOfInsertion":"01 August 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 June 2005","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On adaptive sampling for multisensor tracking of a maneuvering target using IMM/PDA filtering","confLoc":"Portland, OR, USA","sourcePdf":"01470138.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052098S","chronDate":"8-10 June 2005","xplore-pub-id":"9861","isNumber":"31519","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9861","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"31519","articleId":"1470138","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"American Automatic Control Council","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":1470144,"authors":[{"name":"T.

The proposed framework is Lyapunov-based and unlike standard neural network controllers guaranteeing ultimate boundedness, the framework guarantees partial asymptotic stability of the closed-loop system, that is, asymptotic stability with respect to part of the closed-loop system states associated with the system plant states. The neuro adaptive controllers are constructed without requiring explicit knowledge of the system dynamics other than the assumption that the plant dynamics are continuously differentiable and that the approximation error of uncertain system nonlinearities lie in a small gain-type norm bounded conic sector. This allows us to merge robust control synthesis tools with neural network adaptive control tools to guarantee system stability. Finally, an illustrative numerical example is provided to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 June 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1470144/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"8589045","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1470144/","publicationDate":"2005","dateOfInsertion":"01 August 2005","conferenceDate":"8-10 June 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Neural network adaptive control for nonlinear uncertain dynamical systems with asymptotic stability guarantees","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural network adaptive control for nonlinear uncertain dynamical systems with asymptotic stability guarantees","confLoc":"Portland, OR, USA","sourcePdf":"01470144.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.108659S","chronDate":"8-10 June 2005","xplore-pub-id":"9861","isNumber":"31519","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9861","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"31519","articleId":"1470144","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"American Automatic Control Council","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1470149,"authors":[{"name":"E.

The effectiveness of the resulting controller is evaluated with a regulation and a tracking control experiment, performed on a direct-drive robot of spatial kinematics.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACC.2005.1470171","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31519","startPage":"1460","endPage":"1465 vol. 2","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2005, American Control Conference, 2005.","pdfPath":"/iel5/9861/31519/01470171.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Data-based optimal control","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1470171/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 June 2005","htmlLink":"/document/1470171/","displayDocTitle":"Data-based optimal control","conferenceDate":"8-10 June 2005","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8589072","dateOfInsertion":"01 August 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Data-based optimal control","confLoc":"Portland, OR, USA","sourcePdf":"01470171.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064419S","chronDate":"8-10 June 2005","xplore-pub-id":"9861","isNumber":"31519","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9861","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"31519","articleId":"1470171","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"American Automatic Control Council","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1470215,"authors":[{"name":"Jun Oh Jang","affiliation":["Ui-Duk University, Kyongju, South Korea"],"lastName":"Jun Oh Jang","id":"37087182584"},{"name":"Hee Tae Chung","affiliation":["Pusan University of Foreign Studies, busan, South Korea"],"lastName":"Hee Tae Chung","id":"37087291217"},{"name":"Gi Joon Jeon","affiliation":["Kyungpook National University, Daegu, South Korea"],"lastName":"Gi Joon Jeon","id":"37087641552"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-9098-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"0-7803-9099-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0743-1619"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2378-5861"}],"articleNumber":"1470215","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":160},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Fuzzy logic","Actuators","Control systems","Function approximation","Nonlinear control systems","Feedback loop","Windup","Robust stability","Adaptive control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compensation","fuzzy logic","function approximation","tuning","parameter estimation","stability","control nonlinearities","neurocontrollers","fuzzy control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["saturation compensation","deadzone compensation","neural network","fuzzy logic","function approximation","tuning algorithm","bounded parameter estimates","formal nonlinear stability"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1470215","abstract":"A saturation and deadzone compensator is designed for systems by the fuzzy logic (FL) and the neural network (NN).

For alleviating the computational burden, face features are first extracted by the principal component analysis (PCA). In order to avoid the influence of outlier classes and reduce the large overlapping of neighboring classes, a new weighted Fisher linear discriminant (WFLD) criterion is presented by weighting contributions of individual class pairs according to the Euclidian distance of the respective class means. A new learning algorithm is used to train the neural networks classifier, which uses the \"sphere neighborhoods\" to cover the input samples and draw up their distributions in the original space. Thus, the training problem of neural networks may be transformed into the covering problem of a point set, which avoids the iterative process, and overcomes the problem of longtime training of classical neural networks. Simulation results conducted on the ORL database show that the system achieves excellent performance both in terms of error rates of classification and learning efficiency.","doi":"10.1109/ACC.2005.1470219","startPage":"1739","endPage":"1744 vol. 3","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2005, American Control Conference, 2005.","pdfPath":"/iel5/9861/31519/01470219.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2005, American Control Conference, 2005.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACC.2005.1470219","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31519","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Face recognition based on constructive neural networks covering learning algorithm","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Face recognition","Neural networks","Feature extraction","Principal component analysis","Shape measurement","Data mining","Backpropagation algorithms","Automation","Position measurement","Lighting"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["face recognition","neural nets","learning (artificial intelligence)","principal component analysis","image classification"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["face recognition","constructive neural networks","learning algorithm","principal component analysis","weighted Fisher linear discriminant criterion","Euclidian distance","sphere neighborhoods","ORL database"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1470219/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 June 2005","displayDocTitle":"Face recognition based on constructive neural networks covering learning algorithm","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1470219/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2005","dateOfInsertion":"01 August 2005","conferenceDate":"8-10 June 2005","accessionNumber":"8589113","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Face recognition based on constructive neural networks covering learning algorithm","confLoc":"Portland, OR, USA","sourcePdf":"01470219.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.091569S","chronDate":"8-10 June 2005","xplore-pub-id":"9861","isNumber":"31519","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9861","xplore-issue":"31519","articleId":"1470219","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"American Automatic Control Council","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":1470225,"authors":[{"name":"J.H.

Under certain assumptions, the consensus protocol leads to stable behaviors even if the updating instants and sets of the agents are asynchronously determined. The model of asynchronous multi-agent systems encompasses those synchronous ones with various communication patterns, i.e., issues of directional, delayed, or failed communication can be addressed in the same framework. The asynchronous results in this paper thus shed new light on the synchronous results reported in the literature. In particular, synchronous protocols under dynamically changing interaction topologies can be seen as a special case of the asynchronous protocol where all communication delays are zero.","doi":"10.1109/ACC.2005.1470243","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2005, American Control Conference, 2005.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2005, American Control Conference, 2005.","pdfPath":"/iel5/9861/31519/01470243.pdf","startPage":"1883","endPage":"1888 vol. 3","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACC.2005.1470243","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31519","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Information consensus of asynchronous discrete-time multi-agent systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1470243","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 June 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1470243/","displayDocTitle":"Information consensus of asynchronous discrete-time multi-agent systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8599373","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1470243/","conferenceDate":"8-10 June 2005","dateOfInsertion":"01 August 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Information consensus of asynchronous discrete-time multi-agent systems","confLoc":"Portland, OR, USA","sourcePdf":"01470243.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068708S","chronDate":"8-10 June 2005","xplore-pub-id":"9861","isNumber":"31519","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9861","citationCount":"49","xplore-issue":"31519","articleId":"1470243","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"American Automatic Control Council","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1470259,"authors":[{"name":"C.

This interest is spawned from the fact that modeling nonlinear friction effects is a theoretically challenging problem, and compensating for the effects of friction in a controller has practical ramifications. If the friction effects in the system can be accurately modeled, there is an improved potential to design controllers that can cancel the effects; whereas, excessive steady-state tracking errors, oscillations, and limit cycles can result from controllers that do not accurately compensate for friction. A tracking controller is developed in this paper for a general Euler-Lagrange system that contains a new continuously differentiable friction model with uncertain nonlinear parameterizable terms. To achieve the semi-global asymptotic tracking result, a recently developed integral feedback compensation strategy is used to identify the friction effects on-line, assuming exact model knowledge of the remaining dynamics. A Lyapunov-based stability analysis is provided to conclude the tracking and friction identification results. On-going efforts are being directed at the development of an experimental testbed to illustrate the tracking and friction identification performance of the developed controller.","doi":"10.1109/ACC.2005.1470259","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2005, American Control Conference, 2005.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2005, American Control Conference, 2005.","pdfPath":"/iel5/9861/31519/01470259.pdf","startPage":"1975","endPage":"1980 vol. 3","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACC.2005.1470259","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31519","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Lyapunov-based tracking control in the presence of uncertain nonlinear parameterizable friction","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1470259","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 June 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1470259/","displayDocTitle":"Lyapunov-based tracking control in the presence of uncertain nonlinear parameterizable friction","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8599389","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1470259/","conferenceDate":"8-10 June 2005","dateOfInsertion":"01 August 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Lyapunov-based tracking control in the presence of uncertain nonlinear parameterizable friction","confLoc":"Portland, OR, USA","sourcePdf":"01470259.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.08963S","chronDate":"8-10 June 2005","xplore-pub-id":"9861","isNumber":"31519","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9861","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"31519","articleId":"1470259","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"American Automatic Control Council","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1470308,"authors":[{"name":"A.

Algebraic connectivity of a graph is the second smallest eigenvalue of its Laplacian matrix and a measure of speed of solving consensus problems in networks. We demonstrate that it is possible to dramatically increase the algebraic connectivity of a regular complex network by 1000 times or more without adding new links or nodes to the network. This implies that a consensus problem can be solved incredibly fast on certain small-world networks giving rise to a network design algorithm for ultra fast information networks. Our study relies on a procedure called \"random rewiring\" due to Watts & Strogatz (Nature, 1998). Extensive numerical results are provided to support our claims and conjectures. We prove that the mean of the bulk Laplacian spectrum of a complex network remains invariant under random rewiring. The same property only asymptotically holds for scale-free networks. A relationship between increasing the algebraic connectivity of complex networks and robustness to link and node failures is also shown. This is an alternative approach to the use of percolation theory for analysis of network robustness. We also show some connections between our conjectures and certain open problems in the theory of random matrices.","doi":"10.1109/ACC.2005.1470321","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31519","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACC.2005.1470321","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2005, American Control Conference, 2005.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2005, American Control Conference, 2005.","pdfPath":"/iel5/9861/31519/01470321.pdf","startPage":"2371","endPage":"2378 vol. 4","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Ultrafast consensus in small-world networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"8-10 June 2005","displayDocTitle":"Ultrafast consensus in small-world networks","isConference":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 June 2005","dateOfInsertion":"01 August 2005","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1470321/","publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8633760","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1470321/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ultrafast consensus in small-world networks","confLoc":"Portland, OR, USA","sourcePdf":"01470321.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070046S","chronDate":"8-10 June 2005","xplore-pub-id":"9861","isNumber":"31519","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9861","citationCount":"211","xplore-issue":"31519","articleId":"1470321","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"American Automatic Control Council","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":1470337,"authors":[{"name":"S.B.

Typical scan times are on the order of minutes or longer, depending on the size, resolution, and image quality desired. For a variety of reasons it is of great interest to reduce the time to gather an image. One of the most exciting applications is the imaging in real time of dynamic phenomena such as the motion of single molecules in molecular biology. In many cases the sample to be imaged is string-like, such as nanowires, actin, and DNA strands. In this case most of the imaging time is wasted gathering data about the substrate rather than about the sample. In this work we propose a high-level control algorithm to steer the tip along the string, thereby imaging only the area directly around the sample. This approach focuses the resolution directly where desired and greatly reduces the time to gather an image by reducing the area to be scanned. Depending on the sample, an order of magnitude or better improvement in the imaging time can be achieved. As the algorithm makes no demands on the low level control of the tip it can be combined with approaches aimed at increasing the allowed scanning speed, resulting in even greater reductions in the imaging time. Furthermore, the chances of damaging the tip due to interaction with stray particles on the substrate is greatly reduced since the tip is kept near to the sample. In addition to a simulation study, we present a physical experiment in which a carbon nanotube is imaged using an atomic force microscope controlled by the tip-steering algorithm. To the authors knowledge this is the first reported instance of an image obtained by such high-level feedback control.","doi":"10.1109/ACC.2005.1470337","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACC.2005.1470337","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31519","startPage":"2469","endPage":"2474 vol. 4","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2005, American Control Conference, 2005.","pdfPath":"/iel5/9861/31519/01470337.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2005, American Control Conference, 2005.","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1470337","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Atomic force microscopy","Image resolution","High-resolution imaging","Force control","Atomic beams","Structural beams","Image quality","Nanowires","DNA","Focusing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["atomic force microscopy","molecular biophysics","feedback","image processing","position control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["tip steering","atomic force microscopy","cantilevered beam","image quality","molecular biology","low level control","carbon nanotube","high-level feedback control"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Tip steering for fast imaging in AFM","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 June 2005","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"8-10 June 2005","publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8624201","dateOfInsertion":"01 August 2005","htmlLink":"/document/1470337/","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1470337/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Tip steering for fast imaging in AFM","confLoc":"Portland, OR, USA","sourcePdf":"01470337.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054898S","chronDate":"8-10 June 2005","xplore-pub-id":"9861","isNumber":"31519","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9861","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"31519","articleId":"1470337","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"American Automatic Control Council","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1470369,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The fuzzy hyperbolic model (FHM) can be used to establish models for certain unknown complex systems. Furthermore, the main advantage of using the FHM over the Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy model are that no premise structure identification is needed and no completeness design of premise variables space is needed. Also an FHM is a kind of valid global description and nonlinear model in nature. And it is easy to design a filter based on an FHM since FHM satisfies Lipschitz condition. First, FHM is proposed to represent the state-space model for nonlinear continuous-time systems. Next, we design a stable fuzzy H/sub /spl infin// filter based on the FHM, which assures asymptotic stability and a prescribed H/sub /spl infin// index for the filtering error system. A sufficient condition for the existence of such a filter is established through seeking the feasible solutions of a linear matrix inequality (LMI).

First, a linear quadratic regulator (LQR) problem is defined in terms of a linear objective function and several LMI constraints.

One of the dissipativity indices is appended as an LMI constraint in its weak form to the LMI-LQR problem to exploit the dissipative nature of a smart damper. The dissipativity indices and the proposed controller are employed for a two-degree-of-freedom structure with a clipped optimal control problem.

We consider the case where the arrival of the control packet is acknowledged at the receiving actuator, as it happens with the common transfer control protocol (TCP). We start by showing that the separation principle holds. Additionally, we can prove that the optimal LQG control is a linear function of the state. Finally, building upon our previous results on estimation with unreliable communication, the paper shows the existence of critical arrival probabilities below which the optimal controller fails to stabilize the system. This is done by providing analytic upper and lower bounds on the cost functional.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal control with unreliable communication: the TCP case","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2005, American Control Conference, 2005.","doi":"10.1109/ACC.2005.1470488","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2005, American Control Conference, 2005.","pdfPath":"/iel5/9861/31519/01470488.pdf","startPage":"3354","endPage":"3359 vol. 5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACC.2005.1470488","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31519","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1470488","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1470488/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 June 2005","displayDocTitle":"Optimal control with unreliable communication: the TCP case","conferenceDate":"8-10 June 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1470488/","dateOfInsertion":"01 August 2005","publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8599435","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal control with unreliable communication: the TCP case","confLoc":"Portland, OR, USA","sourcePdf":"01470488.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04844S","chronDate":"8-10 June 2005","xplore-pub-id":"9861","isNumber":"31519","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9861","citationCount":"51","xplore-issue":"31519","articleId":"1470488","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"American Automatic Control Council","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1470500,"authors":[{"name":"Mei Yu","affiliation":["Intelligent Control Laboratory Center for Systems and Control Department of Mechanics,Engineering Science, Peking University, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Mei Yu","id":"37086657251"},{"name":"Long Wang","affiliation":["Intelligent Control Laboratory Center for Systems and Control Department of Mechanics,Engineering Science, Peking University, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Long Wang","id":"37087179629"},{"name":"Tianguang Chu","affiliation":["Intelligent Control Laboratory Center for Systems and Control Department of Mechanics,Engineering Science, Peking University, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Tianguang Chu","id":"37087269470"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-9098-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"0-7803-9099-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0743-1619"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2378-5861"}],"articleNumber":"1470500","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":114},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robustness","Uncertainty","Nonlinear systems","Delay systems","Sufficient conditions","State feedback","Linear feedback control systems","Communication system control","Linear matrix inequalities","Constraint optimization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nonlinear control systems","robust control","sampled data systems","telecommunication channels","delays","state feedback","continuous time systems","linear matrix inequalities","optimisation","uncertain systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["robust stabilization","network channel","data packet dropout","communication delays","networked sampled-data systems","continuous-time nonlinear systems","state feedback controllers","linear matrix inequalities","LMI","constrained convex optimization problem"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1470500","abstract":"A new approach is proposed in this paper to study robust stabilization of a class of sampled-data systems with non-linear uncertainties.

A general theorem on optimal filter of Ito-Volterra system with discontinuous measure is presented and then specialized to standard state-space model with both continuous and discrete measurements. The discontinuity of the measurement vector leads to the optimal filter with continuous and impulsive inputs, causing the discontinuity of the filter equations. The size of the jumps in state and covariance matrix can be explicitly calculated using the theory of vibrosolutions. A previously unknown optimal filter for continuous state space systems with continuous and sampled measurements, including multirate, randomly sampled and delayed measurements, is obtained. Under additional assumption, it is shown that the derived optimal filter recovers several known results, including the Kalman-Bucy and Jazwinski filters (continuous process with discrete measurements). The developed and the previously reported filters are compared using Monte Carlo simulations, which show that the optimal result gives the least-mean-square-error estimates of the states, and correctly predicts the goodness of the obtained estimates; the alternative filters tend to be overly optimistic in calculating the quality of the generated state estimates. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the proposed approach is convenient in practice as it neither requires implementation of multirate filters, nor any approximations to handle measurements arriving with different and, possibly, random sampling rates, as often is the case with human-in-the-loop and networked measurements.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Delay","State estimation","Kalman filters","Nonlinear filters","Stochastic systems","Measurement standards","Vectors","Equations","Covariance matrix","State-space methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Kalman filters","stochastic systems","Volterra equations","state-space methods","covariance matrices","Monte Carlo methods","least mean squares methods","state estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Kalman filter","continuous state-space system","continuous measurements","multirate measurements","random measurements","delay measurements","sampled measurements","stochastic state-space system","optimal filter","Ito-Volterra system","state-space model","covariance matrix","Kalman-Bucy filters","Jazwinski filters","Monte Carlo simulations","least-mean-square-error estimates","numerical simulations"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ACC.2005.1470508","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2005, American Control Conference, 2005.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2005, American Control Conference, 2005.","pdfPath":"/iel5/9861/31519/01470508.pdf","startPage":"3462","endPage":"3467 vol. 5","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31519","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACC.2005.1470508","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Kalman filter for continuous state-space system with continuous, multirate, randomly sampled and delayed measurements","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1470508","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Kalman filter for continuous state-space system with continuous, multirate, randomly sampled and delayed measurements","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1470508/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2005","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1470508/","accessionNumber":"8599438","conferenceDate":"8-10 June 2005","dateOfInsertion":"01 August 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 June 2005","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Kalman filter for continuous state-space system with continuous, multirate, randomly sampled and delayed measurements","confLoc":"Portland, OR, USA","sourcePdf":"01470508.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071255S","chronDate":"8-10 June 2005","xplore-pub-id":"9861","isNumber":"31519","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9861","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"31519","articleId":"1470508","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"American Automatic Control Council","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1470511,"authors":[{"name":"H.C.

Although numerous AQM schemes have been proposed to regulate a queue size close to a reference level, most of them are incapable of adequately adapting to TCP network dynamics due to TCP's non-linearity and time-varying stochastic properties. To alleviate these problems, we introduce an AQM technique based on a dynamic neural network using the back-propagation (BP) algorithm. The dynamic neural network is designed to perform as a robust adaptive feedback controller for TCP dynamics after an adequate training period. We evaluate the performances of the proposed neural network AQM approach using simulation experiments. The proposed approach yields superior performance with faster transient time, larger throughput, and higher link utilization compared to two existing schemes: random early detection (RED) and proportional-integral (PI)-based AQM. The neural AQM outperformed PI control and RED, especially in transient state and TCP dynamics variation.","doi":"10.1109/ACC.2005.1470511","startPage":"3480","endPage":"3485 vol. 5","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2005, American Control Conference, 2005.","pdfPath":"/iel5/9861/31519/01470511.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2005, American Control Conference, 2005.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACC.2005.1470511","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31519","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neural network control for TCP network congestion","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Protocols","Adaptive control","Size control","Traffic control","Engineering management","Stochastic processes","Robust control","Programmable control","Performance evaluation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neurocontrollers","transport protocols","queueing theory","stochastic systems","backpropagation","robust control","adaptive control","control system synthesis","feedback","PI control","telecommunication congestion control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural network control","TCP network congestion","transmission control protocol","queue size","nonlinearity properties","time-varying stochastic properties","dynamic neural network","back-propagation algorithm","robust adaptive feedback controller design","random early detection","proportional-integral control","PI control","transient state"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1470511/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 June 2005","displayDocTitle":"Neural network control for TCP network congestion","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1470511/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2005","dateOfInsertion":"01 August 2005","conferenceDate":"8-10 June 2005","accessionNumber":"8615871","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural network control for TCP network congestion","confLoc":"Portland, OR, USA","sourcePdf":"01470511.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.079655S","chronDate":"8-10 June 2005","xplore-pub-id":"9861","isNumber":"31519","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9861","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"31519","articleId":"1470511","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"American Automatic Control Council","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":1470519,"authors":[{"name":"S.C.

However, visual servoing for constrained motion robot tasks has not been addressed so as to provide control schemes that guarantee simultaneous tracking of position, velocity and contact force trajectories for dynamic robot models. The main difficulty lies from the fact that camera information cannot be used to drive force trajectories. Recognizing this fact, in this paper a unique error manifold that includes position-velocity errors and force errors in orthogonal complements is proposed under the framework of passivity, to yield a synergetic scheme that fuses camera, encoder and force sensor signals. This seemingly fusion of all tracking errors into a unique error variable allows to propose a new control system which guarantees local exponential tracking of all error trajectories. A neural network, driven by an orthogonalized second order sliding mode surface is derived to compensate approximately for nonlinear robot dynamics. Residual errors that arise because of the finite size of the neural network are finally eliminated via two sliding modes. Simulations results are presented and discussed.","doi":"10.1109/ACC.2005.1470549","pdfPath":"/iel5/9861/31519/01470549.pdf","startPage":"3694","endPage":"3700 vol. 5","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2005, American Control Conference, 2005.","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2005, American Control Conference, 2005.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACC.2005.1470549","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31519","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An adaptive neural network controller for visual tracking of constrained robot manipulators","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1470549/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 June 2005","displayDocTitle":"An adaptive neural network controller for visual tracking of constrained robot manipulators","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"01 August 2005","accessionNumber":"8589180","publicationDate":"2005","htmlLink":"/document/1470549/","conferenceDate":"8-10 June 2005","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An adaptive neural network controller for visual tracking of constrained robot manipulators","confLoc":"Portland, OR, USA","sourcePdf":"01470549.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076998S","chronDate":"8-10 June 2005","xplore-pub-id":"9861","isNumber":"31519","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9861","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"31519","articleId":"1470549","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"American Automatic Control Council","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":1470594,"authors":[{"name":"Kan-Lin Hsiung","affiliation":["Information Systems Laboratory, Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Stanford, USA"],"lastName":"Kan-Lin Hsiung","id":"37294657600"},{"name":"Seung-Jean Kim","affiliation":["Information Systems Laboratory, Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Stanford, USA"],"lastName":"Seung-Jean Kim","id":"37279281000"},{"name":"S.

We consider an outage-based quality of service (QoS) specification, which requires the uptime probability, i.e., the probability that no transmitter/receiver pair experiences any outage due to fading, is kept above a given level. The problem of finding an optimal power allocation to achieve this QoS goal over lognormal fading wireless channels can be posed as a stochastic geometric program (GP) with joint probabilistic constraints. This stochastic geometric program is extremely hard to solve in general, compared with the stochastic GP associated with Rayleigh fading channels. In this paper, we describe a suboptimal approach based on recently proposed robust geometric programming. With a good compromise between computational efficiency and accuracy, this robust GP relaxation approach finds a power allocation which meets the QoS requirement on the uptime probability. A numerical example is given to demonstrate the method.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 June 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1470594/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"8573566","publicationDate":"2005","conferenceDate":"8-10 June 2005","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1470594/","dateOfInsertion":"01 August 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Power control in lognormal fading wireless channels with uptime probability specifications via robust geometric programming","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power control in lognormal fading wireless channels with uptime probability specifications via robust geometric programming","confLoc":"Portland, OR, USA","sourcePdf":"01470594.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.085594S","chronDate":"8-10 June 2005","xplore-pub-id":"9861","isNumber":"31519","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9861","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"31519","articleId":"1470594","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"American Automatic Control Council","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1470595,"authors":[{"name":"A.R.

To this purpose, rather than limit our investigation to high-level (e.g. throughput and delay) performance figures, we take a closer look at their detailed operation, also in terms of low-level performance metrics (e.g., the probability of accessing specific channel slots). Our investigation on one hand confirms that AIFS differentiation provides superior and more robust operation than contention window differentiation. On the other hand, it highlights performance issues related to the coexistence between 802.11e contention-based stations with legacy 802.11 stations, and provides guidelines for the 802.11e parameter settings when such a coexistence is the goal.","doi":"10.1109/MNET.2005.1470680","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Network","pdfPath":"/iel5/65/31524/01470680.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31524","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MNET.2005.1470680","publicationTitle":"IEEE Network","startPage":"28","endPage":"34","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Understanding 802.11e contention-based prioritization mechanisms and their coexistence with legacy 802.11 stations","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1470680","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"July-Aug. 2005","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 July 2005","displayDocTitle":"Understanding 802.11e contention-based prioritization mechanisms and their coexistence with legacy 802.11 stations","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1470680/","volume":"19","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/1470680/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July-Aug. 2005","accessionNumber":"8508792","dateOfInsertion":"25 July 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Understanding 802.11e contention-based prioritization mechanisms and their coexistence with legacy 802.11 stations","sourcePdf":"01470680.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.045298S","chronDate":"July-Aug. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"65","isNumber":"31524","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"65","citationCount":"98","xplore-issue":"31524","articleId":"1470680","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1470707,"authors":[{"name":"Yan Tang","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical and AeroSpace Engineering, University of Missouri, Rolla, Rolla, MO, USA"],"lastName":"Yan Tang","id":"37087508656"},{"name":"R.G.

This paper develops a hierarchical optimal control methodology for the simultaneous regulation of servomechanism positions, contour error, and machining forces. The contour error and machining force process reside in the top level of the hierarchy where the goals are to 1) drive the contour error to zero to maximize quality and 2) maintain a constant cutting force to maximize productivity. These goals are systematically propagated to the bottom level, via aggregation relationships between the top and bottom-level states, and combined with the bottom-level goals of tracking reference servomechanism positions. A single controller is designed at the bottom level, where the physical control signals reside, that simultaneously meets both the top and bottom-level goals. The hierarchical optimal control methodology is extended to account for variations in force process model parameters and process parameters. Simulations are conducted for four machining operations that validate the developed methodology. The results illustrate that the controller can simultaneously achieve both the top and bottom-level goals.","doi":"10.1109/ACC.2005.1470707","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACC.2005.1470707","startPage":"4512","endPage":"4517 vol. 7","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2005, American Control Conference, 2005.","pdfPath":"/iel5/9861/31519/01470707.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2005, American Control Conference, 2005.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31519","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hierarchical optimal force-position-contour control of machining processes.

This formulation explicitly accounts for the interaction between the UAVs /sub i/splaying cooperation between the vehicles rather than just coordination. As defined in the paper, cooperation entails coordinated task assignment with the additional knowledge of the future implications of a UAV's actions on improving the expected performance of the other UAVs. The key point is that the actions of each UAV can reduce the risk in the environment for all other UAVs; and the new formulation takes advantage of this fact to generate cooperative assignments that achieve better performance. This change in the formulation is accomplished by coupling the failure probabilities for each UAV to the selected missions for all other UAVs. This results in coordinated plans that optimally exploit the coupling effects of cooperation to improve the survival probabilities and expected performance. This allocation is shown to recover real-world air operations planning strategies that provide significant improvements over approaches that do not correctly account for UAV attrition. The problem is formulated as a dynamic programming (DP) problem, which is shown to be more computationally tractable than previous MILP solution approaches. Two DP approximation methods (the one-step and two-step look-ahead) are also developed for larger problems. Simulation results show that the one-step look-ahead can generate cooperative solutions very quickly, but the performance degrades considerably. The two-step look-ahead policy generates plans that are very close to (and in many cases, identical to) the optimal solution and the computation time is still significantly lower than the exact DP approach.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cooperative task assignment of unmanned aerial vehicles in adversarial environments","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2005, American Control Conference, 2005.","doi":"10.1109/ACC.2005.1470731","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2005, American Control Conference, 2005.","pdfPath":"/iel5/9861/31519/01470731.pdf","startPage":"4661","endPage":"4666 vol. 7","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACC.2005.1470731","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31519","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1470731","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1470731/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 June 2005","displayDocTitle":"Cooperative task assignment of unmanned aerial vehicles in adversarial environments","conferenceDate":"8-10 June 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1470731/","dateOfInsertion":"01 August 2005","publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8599487","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cooperative task assignment of unmanned aerial vehicles in adversarial environments","confLoc":"Portland, OR, USA","sourcePdf":"01470731.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060337S","chronDate":"8-10 June 2005","xplore-pub-id":"9861","isNumber":"31519","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9861","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"31519","articleId":"1470731","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"American Automatic Control Council","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":1470739,"authors":[{"name":"Chunjiang Qian","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Texas, San Antonio, San Antonio, TX, USA"],"lastName":"Chunjiang Qian","id":"37087216698"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-9098-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"0-7803-9099-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0743-1619"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2378-5861"}],"articleNumber":"1470739","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":65,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":962},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1470739","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Output feedback","Nonlinear systems","Nonlinear control systems","Control systems","Linear feedback control systems","Polynomials","Design methodology","Linear systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nonlinear control systems","asymptotic stability","control system synthesis","state feedback"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["homogeneous domination approach","global output feedback stabilization","nonlinear systems","homogeneous observer","feedback control"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, a novel systematic design method, namely homogeneous domination approach, is developed for the global output feedback stabilization of nonlinear systems. The nonlinearities of the systems considered in this paper are neither linearly growing nor Lipschitz in immeasurable states, which make the most of existing methods inapplicable to solve the problem. By utilizing the homogeneous domination approach, a global output feedback stabilizer is explicitly constructed in two steps: i) we first design for the nominal linear system a unique homogeneous output feedback controller whose construction is genuinely nonlinear, rather than linear as used in the literature; ii) then we scale the homogeneous observer and controller with an appropriate choice of gain to render the nonlinear system globally asymptotically stable. The homogeneous domination approach not only enables us to completely remove the linear growth condition, which has been the common assumption for global output feedback stabilization, but also provides us a new perspective to deal with the output feedback control problem for nonlinear systems.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31519","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACC.2005.1470739","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2005, American Control Conference, 2005.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2005, American Control Conference, 2005.","pdfPath":"/iel5/9861/31519/01470739.pdf","startPage":"4708","endPage":"4715 vol. 7","doi":"10.1109/ACC.2005.1470739","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A homogeneous domination approach for global output feedback stabilization of a class of nonlinear systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 June 2005","displayDocTitle":"A homogeneous domination approach for global output feedback stabilization of a class of nonlinear systems","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"8-10 June 2005","htmlLink":"/document/1470739/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8599495","dateOfInsertion":"01 August 2005","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1470739/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A homogeneous domination approach for global output feedback stabilization of a class of nonlinear systems","confLoc":"Portland, OR, USA","sourcePdf":"01470739.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073357S","chronDate":"8-10 June 2005","xplore-pub-id":"9861","isNumber":"31519","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9861","citationCount":"65","xplore-issue":"31519","articleId":"1470739","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"American Automatic Control Council","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1470753,"authors":[{"name":"Shuzhi Sam Ge","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"lastName":"Shuzhi Sam Ge","id":"37275647400"},{"name":"Keng-Peng Tee","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"lastName":"Keng-Peng Tee","id":"37275857100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-9098-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"0-7803-9099-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0743-1619"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2378-5861"}],"articleNumber":"1470753","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":108},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Adaptive systems","Programmable control","Adaptive control","Neural networks","Nonlinear control systems","Control systems","MIMO","Delay estimation","Nonlinear systems","Delay systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO systems","delays","nonlinear control systems","adaptive control","neural nets","uncertain systems","Lyapunov methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive neural network control","nonlinear MIMO time-delay systems","delay functionals","tracking controller","unknown delays","separation technique","uncertain functions","unknown functions","Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional","adaptive NN backstepping","semi-globally uniformly ultimately bounded"]}],"abstract":"This paper proposes an adaptive neural network (NN) tracking controller for a class of multi-input multi-output (MIMO) nonlinear systems with unknown delays.

Comparisons of the experimental results with simulation verify the robustness of this algorithm to model uncertainties and communication delays.","doi":"10.1109/ACC.2005.1470774","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACC.2005.1470774","startPage":"4917","endPage":"4922 vol. 7","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2005, American Control Conference, 2005.","pdfPath":"/iel5/9861/31519/01470774.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2005, American Control Conference, 2005.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31519","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Experimental implementation of flocking algorithms in wheeled mobile robots","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 June 2005","displayDocTitle":"Experimental implementation of flocking algorithms in wheeled mobile robots","conferenceDate":"8-10 June 2005","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2005","dateOfInsertion":"01 August 2005","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1470774/","accessionNumber":"8599530","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1470774/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Experimental implementation of flocking algorithms in wheeled mobile robots","confLoc":"Portland, OR, USA","sourcePdf":"01470774.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041513S","chronDate":"8-10 June 2005","xplore-pub-id":"9861","isNumber":"31519","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9861","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"31519","articleId":"1470774","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"American Automatic Control Council","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1470777,"authors":[{"name":"R.T.

This approach is based on a simple root locus design procedure for a proportional-derivative (PD) compensator. From this procedure, design procedures for discrete-time lead, proportional-integral (PI), lag, proportional-integral-derivative (PID), and PI-lead compensators are developed. With this proposed approach, students can concentrate on the larger control system design issues, such as compensator selection and closed-loop performance, rather than the intricacies of a particular design procedure. To demonstrate this approach, an example of a lead design from a digital control system laboratory is presented.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A unified procedure for discrete-time root locus and Bode design","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2005, American Control Conference, 2005.","doi":"10.1109/ACC.2005.1470777","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2005, American Control Conference, 2005.","pdfPath":"/iel5/9861/31519/01470777.pdf","startPage":"4935","endPage":"4940 vol. 7","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACC.2005.1470777","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31519","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1470777","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1470777/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 June 2005","displayDocTitle":"A unified procedure for discrete-time root locus and Bode design","conferenceDate":"8-10 June 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1470777/","dateOfInsertion":"01 August 2005","publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8599533","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A unified procedure for discrete-time root locus and Bode design","confLoc":"Portland, OR, USA","sourcePdf":"01470777.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.080656S","chronDate":"8-10 June 2005","xplore-pub-id":"9861","isNumber":"31519","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9861","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"31519","articleId":"1470777","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"American Automatic Control Council","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1470787,"authors":[{"name":"Zhan Ping","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Cleveland State University, Cleveland, OH, USA"],"lastName":"Zhan Ping","id":"37416083200"},{"name":"Zhiqiang Gao","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Cleveland State University, Cleveland, OH, USA"],"lastName":"Zhiqiang Gao","id":"37278010900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-9098-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"0-7803-9099-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0743-1619"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2378-5861"}],"articleNumber":"1470787","dbTime":"61 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":247},"abstract":"A field programmable gate array (FPGA)-based digital control and communication module (DCCM), designed to be the backbone for future space power management (PMAD) systems, is developed and implemented.

To cope with misbehavior in such self-organized networks, nodes need to be able to automatically adapt their strategy to changing levels of cooperation. Existing approaches such as economic incentives or secure routing by cryptography alleviate some of the problems, but not all. We describe the use of a self-policing mechanism based on reputation to enable mobile ad hoc networks to keep functioning despite the presence of misbehaving nodes. The reputation system in all nodes makes them detect misbehavior locally by observation and use of second-hand information. Once a misbehaving node is detected it is automatically isolated from the network. We classify the features of such reputation systems and describe possible implementations of each of them. We explain in particular how it is possible to use second-hand information while mitigating contamination by spurious ratings.","doi":"10.1109/MCOM.2005.1470831","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel5/35/31523/01470831.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MCOM.2005.1470831","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31523","startPage":"101","endPage":"107","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Self-policing mobile ad hoc networks by reputation systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1470831","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Self-policing mobile ad hoc networks by reputation systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1470831/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 July 2005","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"43","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 2005","accessionNumber":"8507980","dateOfInsertion":"25 July 2005","htmlLink":"/document/1470831/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Self-policing mobile ad hoc networks by reputation systems","sourcePdf":"01470831.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.03896S","chronDate":"July  2005","xplore-pub-id":"35","isNumber":"31523","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"35","citationCount":"273","xplore-issue":"31523","articleId":"1470831","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1470883,"authors":[{"name":"T.

It indicates the possibility of realizing a low-voltage video-rate ADC by using the full current-mode circuit approach.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1470946/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 Sept. 1997","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"16-18 Sept. 1997","dateOfInsertion":"01 August 2005","publicationDate":"1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A low-voltage, high-speed and low-power full current-mode video-rate CMOS A/D converter","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A low-voltage, high-speed and low-power full current-mode video-rate CMOS A/D converter","confLoc":"Southampton, UK","sourcePdf":"01470946.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.110524S","chronDate":"16-18 Sept. 1997","isNumber":"31525","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9916","citationCount":"5","articleId":"1470946","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":1470957,"authors":[{"name":"G.

WINS combine sensing, signal processing, decision capability, and wireless networking capability in a compact, low power system. WINS systems combine microsensor technology with low power sensor interface, signal processing, and RF communication circuits. The need for low cost presents engineering challenges for implementation of these systems in conventional digital CMOS technology. This paper describes micropower data converter, digital signal processing systems, and weak inversion CMOS RF circuits. The digital signal processing system relies on a continuously operating spectrum analyzer. Finally, the weak inversion CMOS RF systems are designed to exploit the properties of high-Q inductors to enable low power operation.

The sensors are made in a standard 3GHz bipolar process. Each PSD measures a light center of gravity, and this way the line of light is sampled in the plane of the image sensor. 3D information is computed by means of triangulation. On chip circuitry takes care of preamplification of the sensorsignals, and multiplexing of the different sensor signals to a single output channel.","doi":"10.1109/ESSCIR.1998.186245","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 24th European Solid-State Circuits Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 24th European Solid-State Circuits Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/9917/31526/01471002.pdf","startPage":"208","endPage":"211","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ESSCIR.1998.186245","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31526","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A smart range image sensor","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1471002","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 Sept. 1998","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1471002/","displayDocTitle":"A smart range image sensor","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1998","conferenceDate":"22-24 Sept. 1998","dateOfInsertion":"01 August 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A smart range image sensor","confLoc":"The Hague, Netherlands","sourcePdf":"01471002.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.029508S","chronDate":"22-24 Sept. 1998","isNumber":"31526","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9917","citationCount":"9","articleId":"1471002","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1471003,"authors":[{"name":"W.

Local brightness adaptation is achieved by dividing the input photocurrent of each sensor pixel by its local average. Since the irradiance at the imager is based on a nonlinear multiplicative combination of scene illumination and object surface reflectance, the output signal of the imager will depend only on the visually relevant reflectance component if the illumination does not significantly vary within the averaging area. The computation of local average is realized by spatial low-pass filtering the input photocurrent distribution using a 2D pseudo-resistive diffusion network. Division by local average inside each pixel is based on a translinear divider. The chip has been realized in a 1 \u00b5m n-well standard CMOS process.

By combining the edge based analog processing technique with active pixel CMOS image sensor matrix, a dense and fast image processing has been achieved. The on-chip processing includes: 1\u00b0 analog histogram equlizer; 2\u00b0 programmable recursive Gaussian filter; 3\u00b0 a spatio-temporal differentiator; and 4\u00b0 a local extrema extractor. A moving blade shutter is applied to the APS matrix in order to adapt the exposure time according to global illumination level. The on-chip, histogram equlizer can extend the image contrast to a constant and optimal range for all the following processing operators. This local image signal regularization gives a constant signal amplitude and permits a stable and predictable precision of other analog signal processing. A prototype chip has been designed and fabricated in a standard 0.8\u00b5 CMOS process with double poly and double metal. The pixel pitch is fixed at 20\u00b5m and gives a total chip area of about 7\u00d77mm2. A line processing time is measured at 50\u00b5S and a frame rate of 50 can be easily obtained. The worst case power consumption is measured at 40mA @ 5V.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 25th European Solid-State Circuits Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/9918/31527/01471145.pdf","startPage":"258","endPage":"261","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 25th European Solid-State Circuits Conference","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31527","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1471145","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 256 \u00d7 256-pixel smart CMOS image sensor for line based stereo vision applications","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["CMOS image sensors","Stereo vision","Signal processing","Histograms","Semiconductor device measurement","Pixel","Image processing","Filters","Blades","Lighting"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1471145/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 Sept. 1999","displayDocTitle":"A 256 \u00d7 256-pixel smart CMOS image sensor for line based stereo vision applications","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1999","dateOfInsertion":"01 August 2005","conferenceDate":"21-23 Sept. 1999","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 256 \u00d7 256-pixel smart CMOS image sensor for line based stereo vision applications","confLoc":"Duisburg, Germany","sourcePdf":"01471145.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039788S","chronDate":"21-23 Sept. 1999","isNumber":"31527","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9918","articleId":"1471145","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1471162,"authors":[{"name":"P.

It is shown that the accuracy is determined primarily by the input sampling capacitance. Therefore in a low-power design some kind of calibration is needed to obtain a high resolution. Here digital self-calibration is employed. By combining opamp sharing with capacitor scaling, only the load of the first stage contributes significantly to the overall power budget. In order to also reduce the capacitive loading of the first stage, the input signal range must be extended. This is achieved by adding extra comparators at the input stage. An experimental prototype in 0.8\u00b5m CMOS was designed for a 5 Volt supply. Measured results at 15 MS/s are a S/(N+THD) of 69dB with 110 mW power drain. All spurs are below -80 dB.

Semiconductor industry roadmap predicts, that beyond the 130 nm technolgy mode, performance improvement of advanced VLSI is likely to begin to saturate unless a paradigm shift from present IC architecture is introduced. This papaer presents a comprehensive analytical treatement of ICs with multiple Si layers (3-D ICs). It is shown that significant improvement in performance (more than 145%) and reduction in wire-limited chip area can be achieved with 3-D ICs with vertical inter-layer interconnects. This analysis is based on dividing a chip into separate blocks, each occupying a physical level. A scheme to optimize interconnect distribution among different interconnect tiers is presented and the effect of transferring the repeaters to upper Si layers has been quantified in this analysis. Various technologies being investigated for 3-D fabrication are reviewed. Finally, implications of 3-D architecture on several circuit designs are also discussed.","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 26th European Solid-State Circuits Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 26th European Solid-State Circuits Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/9919/31528/01471297.pdf","startPage":"406","endPage":"414","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31528","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"3-D ICs: Motivation, performance analysis, and technology","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1471297","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 Sept. 2000","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1471297/","displayDocTitle":"3-D ICs: Motivation, performance analysis, and technology","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2000","conferenceDate":"19-21 Sept. 2000","dateOfInsertion":"01 August 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"3-D ICs: Motivation, performance analysis, and technology","confLoc":"Stockholm, Sweden","sourcePdf":"01471297.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.085808S","chronDate":"19-21 Sept. 2000","isNumber":"31528","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9919","citationCount":"4","articleId":"1471297","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":1471301,"authors":[{"name":"T.

The input resistance of the RGC circuit becomes smaller by the amount of the voltage-gain of the local feedback stage than that of a conventional common-gate input stage. Hence the RGC circuit gives a virtual-ground input impedance and better isolates the input parasitics. With this very low input impedance characteristic, a RGC transimpedance amplifier is realized with a 0.6\u00b5m digital CMOS process.

As a microsensor node must operate for years on a tiny energy source, innovative energy management techniques are needed. Widespread device deployment makes battery replacement infeasible, requiring energy to be scavenged from the environment-- e.g., conversion of ambient vibrations to electric energy. Computation and communication must be optimized for very low duty cycles, making issues such as standby leakage and start-up overhead critical. All levels of the communication hierarchy, from the physical and link layer to routing protocols, must be tuned for energy efficiency. A total-system approach is required for reliable, self-powered microsensor networks that deliver maximal system lifetime in the most challenging environments.","doi":"10.1109/ESSDERC.2002.194869","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 28th European Solid-State Circuits Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/9921/31530/01471466.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31530","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ESSDERC.2002.194869","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 28th European Solid-State Circuits Conference","startPage":"47","endPage":"54","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Power aware wireless microsensor systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1471466","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 Sept. 2002","displayDocTitle":"Power aware wireless microsensor systems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1471466/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1471466/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2002","dateOfInsertion":"01 August 2005","conferenceDate":"24-26 Sept. 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power aware wireless microsensor systems","confLoc":"Florence, Italy","sourcePdf":"01471466.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059188S","chronDate":"24-26 Sept. 2002","xplore-pub-id":"9921","isNumber":"31530","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9921","citationCount":"39","xplore-issue":"31530","articleId":"1471466","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Non IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1471472,"authors":[{"name":"D.

The power dissipation is 200 \u00b5W providing a gainbandwidth (GBW) of 1.9 MHz at a capacitive load of 30 pF and a THD of 90 dB.","startPage":"175","endPage":"178","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 28th European Solid-State Circuits Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/9921/31530/01471494.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 28th European Solid-State Circuits Conference","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31530","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 1.2V, 200 \u00b5 W rail-to-rail Op Amp with 90dB THD using replica gain enhancement","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 Sept. 2002","displayDocTitle":"A 1.2V, 200 \u00b5 W rail-to-rail Op Amp with 90dB THD using replica gain enhancement","conferenceDate":"24-26 Sept. 2002","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2002","dateOfInsertion":"01 August 2005","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1471494/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1471494/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 1.2V, 200 \u00b5 W rail-to-rail Op Amp with 90dB THD using replica gain enhancement","confLoc":"Florence, Italy","sourcePdf":"01471494.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050632S","chronDate":"24-26 Sept. 2002","xplore-pub-id":"9921","isNumber":"31530","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9921","xplore-issue":"31530","articleId":"1471494","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Non IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":1471496,"authors":[{"name":"V.

It achieves 9.2GHz bandwidth in the presence of 0.5pF photo diode capacitance and a trans-resistance gain of 54dB\u03a9, while drawing 55mA from a 2.5V supply.","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 28th European Solid-State Circuits Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 28th European Solid-State Circuits Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/9921/31530/01471526.pdf","startPage":"303","endPage":"306","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31530","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-pole bandwidth enhancement technique for trans-impedance amplifiers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1471526","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 Sept. 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1471526/","displayDocTitle":"Multi-pole bandwidth enhancement technique for trans-impedance amplifiers","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2002","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1471526/","conferenceDate":"24-26 Sept. 2002","dateOfInsertion":"01 August 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-pole bandwidth enhancement technique for trans-impedance amplifiers","confLoc":"Florence, Italy","sourcePdf":"01471526.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.035937S","chronDate":"24-26 Sept. 2002","xplore-pub-id":"9921","isNumber":"31530","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9921","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"31530","articleId":"1471526","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Non IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1471527,"authors":[{"name":"Siang Tong Tan","affiliation":["Analog and Mixed Signal Center, Department of Electrical Engineering, Texas A and M University, College Station, TX, USA"],"lastName":"Siang Tong Tan","id":"37087628145"},{"name":"J.

Implementation and measurement results are discussed.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31530","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 28th European Solid-State Circuits Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 28th European Solid-State Circuits Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/9921/31530/01471578.pdf","startPage":"515","endPage":"518","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel coding topology for digital class-D audio power amplifiers with very low pulse-repetition rate","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 Sept. 2002","displayDocTitle":"A novel coding topology for digital class-D audio power amplifiers with very low pulse-repetition rate","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"24-26 Sept. 2002","htmlLink":"/document/1471578/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2002","dateOfInsertion":"01 August 2005","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1471578/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel coding topology for digital class-D audio power amplifiers with very low pulse-repetition rate","confLoc":"Florence, Italy","sourcePdf":"01471578.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.033441S","chronDate":"24-26 Sept. 2002","xplore-pub-id":"9921","isNumber":"31530","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9921","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"31530","articleId":"1471578","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Non IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1471582,"authors":[{"name":"M.

For wireless Local Area Network (LAN) the standards have chosen orthogonal frequency division multiplex (OFDM) as modulation scheme. An extension beyond the standards to improve the link capacity is adaptive loading. This paper presents the implementation aspects of an OFDM based wireless LAN modem together with adaptive loading on field programmable gate array (FPGA). The FPGA implementation of the wireless LAN modem enhances rapid prototyping and allows flexible integration of extensions to improve the quality of service. Implementation results are given and a comparison is made with an ASIC implementation of the modem. The wireless LAN system will be demonstrated on a generic platform that is developed for prototyping and demonstration of high speed communication systems.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Real time implementation on FPGA of an OFDM based wireless LAN modem extended with adaptive loading","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 28th European Solid-State Circuits Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 28th European Solid-State Circuits Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/9921/31530/01471582.pdf","startPage":"531","endPage":"534","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31530","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1471582","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1471582/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 Sept. 2002","displayDocTitle":"Real time implementation on FPGA of an OFDM based wireless LAN modem extended with adaptive loading","conferenceDate":"24-26 Sept. 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1471582/","dateOfInsertion":"01 August 2005","publicationDate":"2002","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Real time implementation on FPGA of an OFDM based wireless LAN modem extended with adaptive loading","confLoc":"Florence, Italy","sourcePdf":"01471582.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.03421S","chronDate":"24-26 Sept. 2002","xplore-pub-id":"9921","isNumber":"31530","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9921","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"31530","articleId":"1471582","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Non IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1471597,"authors":[{"name":"D.J.

A probabilistic switch produces the desired value as an output that is 0 or 1 with probability p, represented as a PBIT, and, hence, can produce the wrong output value with a probability of (1-p). In contrast with a probabilistic switch, a conventional deterministic switch produces a BIT whose value is always correct. Our switch-based gate constructions are a particular case of a systematic methodology developed for building energy-aware networks for computing, using PBITS. Interesting examples of such networks include AND, OR, and NOT gates (or, as functions, Boolean conjunction, disjunction, and negation, respectively). To quantify the energy savings, novel measures of \"technology independent\" energy complexity are also introduced - these measures parallel conventional machine-independent notions of computational complexity such as the algorithm's running time and space. Networks of switches can be related to Turing machines and to Boolean circuits, both of which are widely known and well-understood models of computation. Our gate and network constructions lend substance to the following thesis (established for the first time by K.V. Palem): the mathematical technique referred to as randomization yielding probabilistic algorithms results in energy savings through a physical interpretation based on statistical thermodynamics and, hence, can serve as a basis for energy-aware computing. While the estimates of the energy saved through PBIT-based probabilistic computing switches and networks developed rely on the constructs and thermodynamic models due to Boltzmann, Gibbs, and Planck, this work has also led to the innovation of probabilistic CMOS-based devices and computing frameworks. Thus, for completeness, the relationship between the physical models on which this work is based and the electrical domain of CMOS-based switching is discussed.","doi":"10.1109/TC.2005.145","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.2005.145","startPage":"1123","endPage":"1137","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/12/31532/01471673.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31532","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy aware computing through probabilistic switching: a study of limits","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1471673/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 2005","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 July 2005","displayDocTitle":"Energy aware computing through probabilistic switching: a study of limits","volume":"54","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"25 July 2005","accessionNumber":"8552572","publicationDate":"Sept. 2005","htmlLink":"/document/1471673/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy aware computing through probabilistic switching: a study of limits","sourcePdf":"01471673.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.131456S","chronDate":"Sept. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"12","isNumber":"31532","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"119","xplore-issue":"31532","articleId":"1471673","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-24"},{"_id":1471674,"authors":[{"name":"Haisang Wu","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, Virginia Technology, Blacksburg, VA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/12/31532/1471674/1471674-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Haisang Wu is currently a PhD candidate in the Bradley Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Virginia Tech.

In legacy environments, system node resources - both physical and logical - are shared among time-critical DTs and local applications that may also be time-critical. Hence, DTs that are scheduled using their propagated TUFs, as mandated by Real-Time CORBA 1.2's Case 2 approach, may suffer performance degradation, if a node utility accrual (UA) scheduler achieves higher locally accrued utility by giving higher eligibility to local threads than to DTs. To alleviate this, we consider decomposing TUFs of DTs into \"sub-TUFs\" for scheduling segments of DTs. We present five decomposition techniques, called UT, SCEQF, SCALL, OPTCON, and TUFS, which are specific to different classes of UA scheduling algorithms, such as those that use utility density and those that use deadline as their key decision metric. Our experimental studies identify the decomposition technique that performs best for each class of UA scheduling algorithms. In particular, our studies show that OPTCON and TUFS perform best for utility density-based UA algorithms, while SCEQF and SCALL perform best for deadline-based UA algorithms.","doi":"10.1109/TC.2005.153","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/12/31532/01471674.pdf","startPage":"1138","endPage":"1153","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.2005.153","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31532","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Time/utility function decomposition techniques for utility accrual scheduling algorithms in real-time distributed systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1471674","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 July 2005","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1471674/","displayDocTitle":"Time/utility function decomposition techniques for utility accrual scheduling algorithms in real-time distributed systems","volume":"54","issue":"9","publicationDate":"Sept. 2005","accessionNumber":"8552573","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1471674/","dateOfInsertion":"25 July 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Time/utility function decomposition techniques for utility accrual scheduling algorithms in real-time distributed systems","sourcePdf":"01471674.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.114538S","chronDate":"Sept. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"12","isNumber":"31532","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"31532","articleId":"1471674","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1471677,"authors":[{"name":"J.

Traditionally, reversing the sender operations, the receiver first assembles all the segments that make up the message, then computes a CRC based on the information part of the message and verifies it against the arriving CRC, and, finally, delivers the information part on to the upper layer protocol (ULP). We present an incremental CRC computation whereby each arriving segment contributes its share to the message's CRC upon arrival, independently of other segment arrivals, and can thus proceed immediately to the ULP. We impose no constraint on the order of segment arrivals nor on their sizes. Yet, in its time complexity, our scheme does not exceed the traditional computation, which assembles all the segments first, and it uses only a fixed and very small amount of extra memory. Our scheme is beneficial when the ULP can process the individual segments without reading the entire message first and can revert, if needed, to the state it had prior to the processing of any segment of that message. One practical example application is the evolving protocol for remote direct memory access (RDMA) over TCP, where an overall CRC is added to a concatenation of data segments.","doi":"10.1109/TC.2005.151","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/12/31532/01471677.pdf","startPage":"1178","endPage":"1181","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31532","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.2005.151","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Out of order incremental CRC computation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1471677","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 2005","displayDocTitle":"Out of order incremental CRC computation","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1471677/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2005","dateOfInsertion":"25 July 2005","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"8552576","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1471677/","volume":"54","issue":"9","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 July 2005","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Out of order incremental CRC computation","sourcePdf":"01471677.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.03209S","chronDate":"Sept. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"12","isNumber":"31532","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"31532","articleId":"1471677","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":1471693,"authors":[{"name":"I.

Today, isosurfaces are most often visualized by extracting a polygonal approximation that is then rendered via graphics hardware or by using a special variant of preintegrated volume rendering. However, these approaches have a number of limitations in terms of the quality of the isosurface, lack of performance for complex data sets, or supported shading models. An alternative isosurface rendering method that does not suffer from these limitations is to directly ray trace the isosurface. However, this approach has been much too slow for interactive applications unless massively parallel shared-memory supercomputers have been used. In this paper, we implement interactive isosurface ray tracing on commodity desktop PCs by building on recent advances in real-time ray tracing of polygonal scenes and using those to improve isosurface ray tracing performance as well. The high performance and scalability of our approach will be demonstrated with several practical examples, including the visualization of highly complex isosurface data sets, the interactive rendering of hybrid polygonal/isosurface scenes, including high-quality ray traced shading effects, and even interactive global illumination on isosurfaces.","doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2005.79","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","pdfPath":"/iel5/2945/31533/01471693.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2005.79","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31533","startPage":"562","endPage":"572","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Faster isosurface ray tracing using implicit KD-trees","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1471693","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Faster isosurface ray tracing using implicit KD-trees","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.-Oct.  2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1471693/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 July 2005","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"11","issue":"5","publicationDate":"Sept.-Oct. 2005","accessionNumber":"8541641","pubMedId":"16144253","dateOfInsertion":"25 July 2005","htmlLink":"/document/1471693/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Faster isosurface ray tracing using implicit KD-trees","sourcePdf":"01471693.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.113109S","chronDate":"Sept.-Oct.  2005","xplore-pub-id":"2945","isNumber":"31533","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"2945","citationCount":"34","xplore-issue":"31533","articleId":"1471693","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1471694,"authors":[{"name":"G.

Curvature is an indicator of ridges and can be used in applications such as shape analysis and recognition, object segmentation, adaptive smoothing, anisotropic fairing of irregular meshes, and anisotropic texture mapping. In this paper, a new framework is proposed for accurate curvature estimation in discrete surfaces. The proposed framework is based on a local directional curve sampling of the surface where the sampling frequency can be controlled. This local model has a large number of degrees of freedoms compared with known techniques and, so, can better represent the local geometry. The proposed framework is quantitatively evaluated and compared with common techniques for surface curvature estimation. In order to perform an unbiased evaluation in which smoothing effects are factored out, we use a set of randomly generated Bezier surface patches for which the curvature values can be analytically computed. It is demonstrated that, through the establishment of sampling conditions, the error in estimations obtained by the proposed framework is smaller and that the proposed framework is less sensitive to low sampling density, sampling irregularities, and sampling noise.","doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2005.69","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2005.69","startPage":"573","endPage":"583","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","pdfPath":"/iel5/2945/31533/01471694.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31533","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A sampling framework for accurate curvature estimation in discrete surfaces","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 July 2005","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.-Oct.  2005","displayDocTitle":"A sampling framework for accurate curvature estimation in discrete surfaces","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept.-Oct. 2005","dateOfInsertion":"25 July 2005","volume":"11","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1471694/","accessionNumber":"8550398","pubMedId":"16144254","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1471694/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A sampling framework for accurate curvature estimation in discrete surfaces","sourcePdf":"01471694.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044783S","chronDate":"Sept.-Oct.  2005","isNumber":"31533","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"2945","citationCount":"15","articleId":"1471694","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-20"},{"_id":1471696,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The first method is robust against 3D rotation, translation, and uniform scaling. The second one is robust against both geometric and mesh simplification attacks. A pseudorandom watermarking signal is cast in the 3D mesh object by deforming its vertices geometrically, without altering the vertex topology. Prior to watermark embedding and detection, the object is rotated and translated so that its center of mass and its principal component coincide with the origin and the z-axis of the Cartesian coordinate system. This geometrical transformation ensures watermark robustness to translation and rotation. Robustness to uniform scaling is achieved by restricting the vertex deformations to occur only along the r coordinate of the corresponding (r, /spl theta/, /spl phi/) spherical coordinate system. In the first method, a set of vertices that correspond to specific angles /spl theta/ is used for watermark embedding. In the second method, the samples of the watermark sequence are embedded in a set of vertices that correspond to a range of angles in the /spl theta/ domain in order to achieve robustness against mesh simplifications. Experimental results indicate the ability of the proposed method to deal with the aforementioned attacks.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1471696/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 July 2005","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.-Oct.  2005","publicationDate":"Sept.-Oct. 2005","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1471696/","dateOfInsertion":"25 July 2005","accessionNumber":"8550399","pubMedId":"16144256","volume":"11","issue":"5","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Blind robust watermarking schemes for copyright protection of 3D mesh objects","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Blind robust watermarking schemes for copyright protection of 3D mesh objects","sourcePdf":"01471696.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.125468S","chronDate":"Sept.-Oct.  2005","xplore-pub-id":"2945","isNumber":"31533","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"2945","citationCount":"100","xplore-issue":"31533","articleId":"1471696","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1471703,"authors":[{"name":"Kwang In Kim","affiliation":["A.I.

The original form of KPCA, however, can be only applied to strongly restricted image classes due to the limited number of training examples that can be processed. We therefore propose a new iterative method for performing KPCA, the kernel Hebbian algorithm, which iteratively estimates the kernel principal components with only linear order memory complexity. In our experiments, we compute models for complex image classes such as faces and natural images which require a large number of training examples. The resulting image models are tested in single-frame super-resolution and denoising applications. The KPCA model is not specifically tailored to these tasks; in fact, the same model can be used in super-resolution with variable input resolution, or denoising with unknown noise characteristics, in spite of this, both super-resolution and denoising performance are comparable to existing methods.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Iterative kernel principal component analysis for image modeling","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","doi":"10.1109/TPAMI.2005.181","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel5/34/31534/01471703.pdf","startPage":"1351","endPage":"1366","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.2005.181","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31534","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1471703","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1471703/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 July 2005","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2005","displayDocTitle":"Iterative kernel principal component analysis for image modeling","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"27","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/1471703/","dateOfInsertion":"25 July 2005","publicationDate":"Sept. 2005","accessionNumber":"8544306","pubMedId":"16173181","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Iterative kernel principal component analysis for image modeling","sourcePdf":"01471703.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.10398S","chronDate":"Sept.  2005","xplore-pub-id":"34","isNumber":"31534","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"191","xplore-issue":"31534","articleId":"1471703","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":1471704,"authors":[{"name":"N.

An image is first projected into an edge subspace spanned using an ICA basis adapted to natural images which captures the sharp features of an image like edges and curves. The residual image obtained after extraction of the sharp image features is approximated using a mixture of probabilistic principal component analyzers (MPPCA) model. The model is consistent with cellular, functional, information theoretic, and learning paradigms in visual pathway modeling. We demonstrate the efficiency of our model for representing different attributes of natural images like color and luminance. We compare the performance of our model in terms of quality of representation against commonly used basis, like the discrete cosine transform (DCT), independent component analysts (ICA), and principal components analysis (PCA), based on their entropies. Chrominance and luminance components of images are represented using codes having lower entropy than DCT, ICA, or PCA for similar visual quality. The model attains considerable simplification for learning from images by using a sparse independent code for representing edges and explicitly evaluating probabilities in the residual subspace.","doi":"10.1109/TPAMI.2005.170","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel5/34/31534/01471704.pdf","startPage":"1367","endPage":"1378","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.2005.170","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31534","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new image representation algorithm inspired by image submodality models, redundancy reduction, and learning in biological vision","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1471704","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 July 2005","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1471704/","displayDocTitle":"A new image representation algorithm inspired by image submodality models, redundancy reduction, and learning in biological vision","volume":"27","issue":"9","publicationDate":"Sept. 2005","accessionNumber":"8544307","pubMedId":"16173182","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1471704/","dateOfInsertion":"25 July 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new image representation algorithm inspired by image submodality models, redundancy reduction, and learning in biological vision","sourcePdf":"01471704.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.098405S","chronDate":"Sept.  2005","xplore-pub-id":"34","isNumber":"31534","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"31534","articleId":"1471704","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":1471706,"authors":[{"name":"B.J.

While impressive achievements have been made in pattern classification problems such as handwritten character recognition, face detection, speaker identification, and prediction of gene function, it is even more exciting that researchers are on the verge of introducing systems that can perform large-scale combinatorial analyses of data, decomposing the data into interacting components. For example, computational methods for automatic scene analysis are now emerging in the computer vision community. These methods decompose an input image into its constituent objects, lighting conditions, motion patterns, etc. Two of the main challenges are finding effective representations and models in specific applications and finding efficient algorithms for inference and learning in these models. In this paper, we advocate the use of graph-based probability models and their associated inference and learning algorithms. We review exact techniques and various approximate, computationally efficient techniques, including iterated conditional modes, the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm, Gibbs sampling, the mean field method, variational techniques, structured variational techniques and the sum-product algorithm (\"loopy\" belief propagation). We describe how each technique can be applied in a vision model of multiple, occluding objects and contrast the behaviors and performances of the techniques using a unifying cost function, free energy.","doi":"10.1109/TPAMI.2005.169","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel5/34/31534/01471706.pdf","startPage":"1392","endPage":"1416","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.2005.169","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31534","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A comparison of algorithms for inference and learning in probabilistic graphical models","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1471706","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 July 2005","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1471706/","displayDocTitle":"A comparison of algorithms for inference and learning in probabilistic graphical models","volume":"27","issue":"9","publicationDate":"Sept. 2005","accessionNumber":"8544309","pubMedId":"16173184","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1471706/","dateOfInsertion":"25 July 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A comparison of algorithms for inference and learning in probabilistic graphical models","sourcePdf":"01471706.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.111437S","chronDate":"Sept.  2005","xplore-pub-id":"34","isNumber":"31534","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"101","xplore-issue":"31534","articleId":"1471706","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1471708,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

The projection framework is combined with a rejection scheme which allows rapid rejection of image windows that are distant from the pattern.

Two of the most important of these characteristics are the shading and reflectance of each point in the scene. We present an algorithm that uses multiple cues to recover shading and reflectance intrinsic images from a single image. Using both color information and a classifier trained to recognize gray-scale patterns, given the lighting direction, each image derivative is classified as being caused by shading or a change in the surface's reflectance. The classifiers gather local evidence about the surface's form and color, which is then propagated using the generalized belief propagation algorithm. The propagation step disambiguates areas of the image where the correct classification is not clear from local evidence. We use real-world images to demonstrate results and show how each component of the system affects the results.","doi":"10.1109/TPAMI.2005.185","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel5/34/31534/01471710.pdf","startPage":"1459","endPage":"1472","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.2005.185","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31534","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Recovering intrinsic images from a single image","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1471710","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 July 2005","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1471710/","displayDocTitle":"Recovering intrinsic images from a single image","volume":"27","issue":"9","publicationDate":"Sept. 2005","accessionNumber":"8544313","pubMedId":"16173188","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1471710/","dateOfInsertion":"25 July 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Recovering intrinsic images from a single image","sourcePdf":"01471710.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.078205S","chronDate":"Sept.  2005","xplore-pub-id":"34","isNumber":"31534","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"238","xplore-issue":"31534","articleId":"1471710","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":1471714,"authors":[{"name":"C.J.

From a classifier design standpoint, such small sample size problems have some interesting challenges. The first challenge is to find, from all hyperplanes that separate the classes, a separating hyperplane which generalizes well for future data. A second important task is to determine which features are required to distinguish the classes. To attack these problems, we propose the LESS (lowest error in a sparse subspace) classifier that efficiently finds linear discriminants in a sparse subspace. In contrast with most classifiers for high-dimensional data sets, the LESS classifier incorporates a (simple) data model. Further, by means of a regularization parameter, the classifier establishes a suitable trade-off between subspace sparseness and classification accuracy.

Simultaneous tuning of multiwavelengths is demonstrated and a stability test shows a power fluctuation of less than 0.2 dB during a 3-h test.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Stimulated emission","Semiconductor optical amplifiers","Optical amplifiers","Ring lasers","Testing","Channel spacing","Temperature","Optical tuning","Laser tuning","Stability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["semiconductor optical amplifiers","ring lasers","laser cavity resonators","wavelength division multiplexing","laser stability","channel spacing","laser tuning","fluctuations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiwavelength laser source","linear optical amplifier","ring laser","dense wavelength-division-multiplexing","inhomogeneous gain medium","gain competition","stable multiwavelength lasing","channel spacing","room temperature","multiwavelength tuning","stability test","power fluctuation","4 to 8 GHz","1 to 2 GHz","293 to 298 K","3 h"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Linear optical amplifier (LOA)","multiwavelength laser"]}],"doi":"10.1109/LPT.2005.851912","publicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Technology Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Technology Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/68/31536/01471751.pdf","startPage":"1611","endPage":"1613","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31536","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LPT.2005.851912","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiwavelength laser source using linear optical amplifier","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1471751","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Multiwavelength laser source using linear optical amplifier","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1471751/","volume":"17","issue":"8","publicationDate":"Aug. 2005","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1471751/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"8518318","dateOfInsertion":"25 July 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2005","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 July 2005","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiwavelength laser source using linear optical amplifier","sourcePdf":"01471751.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043623S","chronDate":"Aug.  2005","xplore-pub-id":"68","isNumber":"31536","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"68","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"31536","articleId":"1471751","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1471752,"authors":[{"name":"T.

The filter consists of an optical phase modulator, a length of high birefringence (Hi-Bi) fiber, a 25-km singlemode fiber and a narrow linewidth laser source. Different time delays are achieved when the two orthogonal polarization modes are traveling along the Hi-Bi fiber. The baseband resonance is eliminated by use of the optical phase modulator in combination with the 25-km single-mode fiber serving as a dispersive device. The proposed filter is immune to optical interference because of the orthogonality of the two polarization modes. A two-tap all-optical microwave bandpass filter with a null-to-null bandwidth of 8.7 GHz and a notch rejection level greater than 30 dB implemented in the 25-km RoF link is demonstrated.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1471793/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 July 2005","volume":"17","issue":"8","accessionNumber":"8518360","publicationDate":"Aug. 2005","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1471793/","dateOfInsertion":"25 July 2005","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"All-optical microwave bandpass filters implemented in a radio-over-fiber link","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"All-optical microwave bandpass filters implemented in a radio-over-fiber link","sourcePdf":"01471793.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.070867S","chronDate":"Aug.  2005","xplore-pub-id":"68","isNumber":"31536","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"68","citationCount":"40","xplore-issue":"31536","articleId":"1471793","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1471876,"authors":[{"name":"C.K.

Operation with and without attenuators was investigated using a movable electromagnetic probe to measure power level along the tube. Quite different effects of drive power and beam voltage on the saturation level were found for operation with and without attenuators. The maximum power level is lower for attenuator operation. Also, power levels do not continue to increase with increasing beam voltage and drive power. In contrast, attenuator-less operation produces the highest efficiency, and the power levels continue to rise with increasing beam voltage and drive power. Conversion efficiencies as high as 25 per cent are obtained with an attenuator and as high as 40 per cent without an attenuator. Efficiency calculations based on small-signal theory can be made to agree reasonably well with the experimental attenuator-less operation efficiencies by assuming an appropriate ratio of the ac component of beam current to the dc component of beam current, i/I\n<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">0</inf>\n.","doi":"10.1109/T-ED.1956.14093","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/T-ED.1956.14093","startPage":"6","endPage":"17","displayPublicationTitle":"IRE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel5/4639142/31546/01472012.pdf","publicationTitle":"IRE Transactions on Electron Devices","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31546","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Large signal behavior of high power traveling-wave amplifiers","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1956","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1956","displayDocTitle":"Large signal behavior of high power traveling-wave amplifiers","publicationDate":"Jan. 1956","dateOfInsertion":"09 August 2005","volume":"3","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1472012/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Large signal behavior of high power traveling-wave amplifiers","sourcePdf":"01472012.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.027209S","chronDate":"Jan.  1956","isNumber":"31546","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4639142","citationCount":"6","articleId":"1472012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1956","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":1472013,"authors":[{"name":"H.R.

For C = 0.1 similar solutions are obtained for several values of the space-charge parameter K. Presented in graphical form, the results of these various solutions shed a considerable amount of light on the high-level operation of the traveling-wave amplifier.","doi":"10.1109/T-ED.1956.14098","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/T-ED.1956.14098","startPage":"39","endPage":"56","displayPublicationTitle":"IRE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel5/4639142/31546/01472017.pdf","publicationTitle":"IRE Transactions on Electron Devices","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31546","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A large-signal analysis of the traveling-wave amplifier: Theory and general results","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1956","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1956","displayDocTitle":"A large-signal analysis of the traveling-wave amplifier: Theory and general results","publicationDate":"Jan. 1956","dateOfInsertion":"09 August 2005","volume":"3","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1472017/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A large-signal analysis of the traveling-wave amplifier: Theory and general results","sourcePdf":"01472017.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036857S","chronDate":"Jan.  1956","isNumber":"31546","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4639142","citationCount":"61","articleId":"1472017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1956","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1472099,"authors":[{"name":"J.P.

This paper analyzes the variation of transition capacitance with bias voltage of a junction of semiconductors with graded impurity densities; i. e., densities which are an arbitrary function of position. It is found that the transition capacitance can be simply related to a depletion width and that, in turn, depletion width can be related to the bias voltage. An analysis is also carried out for the impurity grading to produce a specified transition capacitance variation, as for instance, a linear variation of capacitance with bias voltage. It is also possible to determine impurity gradings to satisfy certain special conditions. An example of this type that is considered in some detail is the determination of the impurity grading which will produce avalanche breakdown simultaneously throughout the semiconductor. An important result of the analysis is that the capacitance vs bias voltage relation can be favorably modified by suitable choice of impurity grading (see Fig. 7). The practical realization of the various characteristics considered in this article is contingent upon techniques for fabricating semiconductors with specified impurity gradings.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31553","publicationTitle":"IRE Transactions on Electron Devices","displayPublicationTitle":"IRE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel5/4639142/31553/01472275.pdf","doi":"10.1109/T-ED.1957.14296","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/T-ED.1957.14296","startPage":"207","endPage":"215","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Junction capacitance and related characteristics using graded impurity semiconductors","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  1957","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  1957","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1472275/","displayDocTitle":"Junction capacitance and related characteristics using graded impurity semiconductors","isJournal":true,"volume":"4","issue":"3","dateOfInsertion":"09 August 2005","publicationDate":"July 1957","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Junction capacitance and related characteristics using graded impurity semiconductors","sourcePdf":"01472275.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039958S","chronDate":"July  1957","isNumber":"31553","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4639142","citationCount":"14","articleId":"1472275","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1957","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1472281,"authors":[{"name":"D.A.

Several tubes of these types for operation below 500 mc have been built. Amplifier bandwidths and oscillator tuning ranges in excess of four to one in frequency have been obtained experimentally.

The device utilizes a filter-type loaded waveguide slow-wave circuit, with interaction below the propagating range of the circuit. This gives rise to a broad-band inductive-wall type of amplification with high gain per unit length. The particular structure outlined employs a spatial-harmonic traveling-wave circuit to couple the energy to the input and to extract power at the output. The main interaction circuit is separated from the input and output section by short ceramic terminations. With proper design, performance at good efficiencies is obtained over a 10 per cent bandwidth to date. A special feature of the device is the possibility of adjusting the gain variation with frequency to suit the designer. This comes about from the fact that the gain per unit length decreases with frequency in the coupling sections, and increases with frequency in the center (nonpropagating) section. By proper selection of the relative lengths of the two circuits, it is possible to obtain either flat gain or peak gain at either end of the frequency range. The efficiency does not appear to be affected by the center section and is limited by the characteristics of the output section only. With the present configuration, it was possible to obtain both good stability and reasonable efficiency simultaneously.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31558","publicationTitle":"IRE Transactions on Electron Devices","displayPublicationTitle":"IRE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel5/4639142/31558/01472457.pdf","doi":"10.1109/T-ED.1958.14414","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/T-ED.1958.14414","startPage":"161","endPage":"166","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A hybrid type traveling-wave tube for high-power pulsed amplification","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  1958","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  1958","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1472457/","displayDocTitle":"A hybrid type traveling-wave tube for high-power pulsed amplification","isJournal":true,"volume":"5","issue":"3","dateOfInsertion":"09 August 2005","publicationDate":"July 1958","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A hybrid type traveling-wave tube for high-power pulsed amplification","sourcePdf":"01472457.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.023185S","chronDate":"July  1958","isNumber":"31558","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4639142","citationCount":"4","articleId":"1472457","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1958","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1472459,"authors":[{"name":"C.F.

Several important characteristics of traveling-wave tubes which employ periodic slow-wave circuits are described. It is found that, even for a lossless circuit, the gain does not become large near either pass band edge although the interaction impedance does become very large. Furthermore, useful amplification is found to occur outside the normal circuit pass band, particularly when the frequency is below the low-frequency cutoff where the circuit presents an inductive reactance to the beam. The problem of matching uniform transmission lines to the periodic circuit is discussed from the equivalent circuit point of view and it is shown that the terminating impedance which produces no reflection from the output end of the circuit when the beam is present may be appreciably different from that required when the beam is absent. The method of analysis applies to spatial harmonic operation, including backward spatial harmonics, as well as to synchronously tuned multicavity klystrons.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1472462/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  1958","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  1958","publicationDate":"July 1958","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"09 August 2005","volume":"5","issue":"3","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Characteristics of traveling-wave tubes with periodic circuits","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Characteristics of traveling-wave tubes with periodic circuits","sourcePdf":"01472462.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036261S","chronDate":"July  1958","isNumber":"31558","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4639142","citationCount":"17","articleId":"1472462","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1958","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1472470,"authors":[{"name":"H.A.

For resistive and capacitive loads, transient energy is delivered during the turn-on period because the internal space-charge capacity induces a forward current in the base, which is amplified. For an inductive load, energy is delivered during the turn-off period because of the high induced voltage. Analytical expressions are derived to show the different transistor parameters and circuit constants which influence the magnitude of transient energy. By far the most important parameter is the sustain voltage. If this voltage is exceeded in the resistive or capacitive load condition, the initial base current is amplified by a greatly increased current gain causing excessive dissipation. If the voltage induced in the inductive load exceeds the sustain voltage, the negative resistance collector characteristic may cause highly dissipative oscillations which usually destroy the transistor. The transistor may be protected from destruction by preventing the base from biasing in the reverse direction so as to avoid negative resistance.","doi":"10.1109/T-ED.1959.14453","publicationTitle":"IRE Transactions on Electron Devices","displayPublicationTitle":"IRE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel5/4639142/31560/01472496.pdf","startPage":"79","endPage":"83","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/T-ED.1959.14453","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31560","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Effect of transient voltages on transistors","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1472496/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1959","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1959","displayDocTitle":"Effect of transient voltages on transistors","volume":"6","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 1959","dateOfInsertion":"09 August 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Effect of transient voltages on transistors","sourcePdf":"01472496.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.025545S","chronDate":"Jan.  1959","isNumber":"31560","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4639142","citationCount":"1","articleId":"1472496","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1959","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1472510,"authors":[{"name":"S.

In this paper, the diffusion equation inside the base region of an alloyed transistor is solved, and an analytic expression for the dc amplification factor is presented in terms of arbitrary bulk lifetime and surface-recombination velocity and the geometry of the transistor. The surface-recombination term depends on the distribution of the injected carriers along the emitter-base boundary, and hence, it increases as the emitter current increases on account of the base-resistance bias effect which tends to concentrate the minority carriers near the periphery of the emitter. The falloff in beta at high-emitter current is attributed mainly to an increase in the surface-recombination term, contrary to Webster's theory. A comparison with Webster's theory is made on units having the same bulk property but different surface treatments. Experimental results give strong support to the present theory.","doi":"10.1109/T-ED.1959.14467","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/T-ED.1959.14467","startPage":"162","endPage":"169","displayPublicationTitle":"IRE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel5/4639142/31561/01472510.pdf","publicationTitle":"IRE Transactions on Electron Devices","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31561","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the theory of DC amplification factor of junction transistors","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April  1959","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  1959","displayDocTitle":"On the theory of DC amplification factor of junction transistors","publicationDate":"April 1959","dateOfInsertion":"09 August 2005","volume":"6","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1472510/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the theory of DC amplification factor of junction transistors","sourcePdf":"01472510.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033988S","chronDate":"April  1959","isNumber":"31561","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4639142","citationCount":"3","articleId":"1472510","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1959","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":1472516,"authors":[{"name":"E.D.

The equations are solved, in the limit where the circuit ringing time is very short compared with all other characteristic times, for two cases: 1) the spin-lattice and spin-spin relaxation times both infinite, with an externally applied driving field, and 2) the spin-lattice relaxation time infinite but the spin-spin relaxation time finite, in the absence of an external field. In case 1), it is shown that the motion of an initially inverted magnetization under the action of an applied signal consists roughly of two stages: in the first stage, the effect of radiation damping is unimportant and the motion of the system is determined principally by the applied signal via the ordinary Bloch equations, whereas in the second stage, the motion is essentially the same as if the applied signal had been turned off and only radiation damping were present. In case 2), it is shown that a delayed peak in the emitted radiation should be observed under certain conditions. The delayed peak condition is identical with that derived by Bloom. Curves are presented showing the peak power and the time at which the delayed peak occurs as functions of the relevant parameters. In connection with the ordinary maser behavior of a two-level spin system, it is shown that for values of the parameters typical of steady-state maser amplification, the effects of radiation damping should be unimportant. Finally, systems are examined for which the radiation damping time is much shorter than all other characteristic times (super-regenerative systems).

For the general volume recombination model, a method based on network reduction is presented which allows one to calculate the spectral density of the electron and hole fluctuations without solving for the spectra of the fluctuations in occupancy of the recombination centers and traps. The method is extended to a surface recombination model, thereby avoiding the ambiguities found in previous formal treatments. It is shown that the concept of ambipolar diffusion, the location and spectral density of the random sources, and the spatial correlation of Fourier coefficients of carrier density fluctuations all have simple significance in electrical terms. Using transmission line techniques, the generation-recombination (GR) spectrum is calculated for a two-level semiconductor where recombination occurs at opposite plane surfaces. This new result is examined in detail for the limiting cases approached when the recombination process is 1) volume-limited, 2) surface-limited, and 3) diffusion-limited. It is shown that in the first two cases, the spectrum is identical with that obtained from a zero-dimensional analysis provided the time constant is properly defined. For the diffusion-limited case, however, the spectrum varies as 1/\u03c9\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">3/2</sup>\nat high frequencies, and at low frequencies the noise is 5/6 that predicted by the simple theory.

In an appropriate circuit the device has useful switching gain for both the turn-on and turn-off operations. A pulse of one polarity turns the switch on, and a pulse of the opposite polarity turns it off. In the absence of triggers, the state is maintained. Equivalence to a pair of complementary conventional transistors in a direct-connected, common-base emitter-follower regenerative circuit is shown. The collector junction is common to both transistor sections so that saturation is simultaneous. Saturation current is kept small in one section, and the switch is turned off by withdrawing the small saturation current. Expressions are derived for switching gain, and requirements on device parameters are obtained. Common-emitter gain for one transistor section must exceed the ratio of load current to off-trigger current. Device structure is described. A combination of alloy, diffusion, and post-alloy diffusion techniques is used for fabrication. One transistor section with a thin base has high common-emitter gain, and the other has moderate gain. Switching performance data are given. A load current of 20 ma at 20 volts is switched with 2-ma pulses. Trigger pulse durations of the order of the switching time are required.

The electron-wave interaction exhibits the same type of first-order axial beam bunching characteristic of the conventional slow-wave traveling-wave tube; hence, it can be used in place of conventional O-type interaction in extended interaction klystrons and electron accelerators, as well as traveling-wave tubes. Experimental results are presented for the simplest physical embodiment of the Ubitron, which consists of an undulated pencil beam in a rectangular waveguide. Two of the unique features of this tube are very broad interaction bandwidth which results from the absence of a dispersive slow-wave circuit, and variable interaction phase velocity--hence, variable saturation power level. Among the physical embodiments of the Ubitron are a number of higher-order mode waveguide and beam configurations. These include plane, coaxial, and circular waveguides, all supporting the TE\n<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">01</inf>\nmode, interacting with magnetically undulated sheet, hollow and cylindrical beams, respectively. The advantage of these configurations, which have not yet been tested experimentally, is that they provide a very large interaction area for beam placement.

Higher efficiency and larger gain-bandwidth product, as predicted by theory, were observed experimentally with a pulsed S-band distributed klystron operated at a maximum beam voltage of 22 kv and a beam current of 3.5 amperes.

By feeding microwave power into the cavity and measuring electric field and the heat dissipated in the window and in the metal walls, a non-linear window-heating effect was discovered above a certain critical field strength. In this condition, watts dissipated at the window vary as the fifth or higher power of the electric field strength and the resulting thermal stresses may easily destroy it. Further experiments were performed on various modifications of the original structure in order to isolate and study the phenomena responsible for the heating. Some of these tests were made using an axial magnetic field. It was found that there are two distinct mechanisms of heating, one requiring the presence of the magnetic field and the other one not requiring it. Both involve energy exchange between the electric field and the window by free electrons which dance on the window surface synchronously with the alternating field and multiply by a secondary emission or multipactor process above a certain field strength. The critical field strength may be greatly reduced by the presence of contaminating films on the dielectric surface, and may be greatly increased by suitable surface treatment. It is shown that these effects are not restricted to cylindrical windows but will tend to occur at any dielectric surface in vacuum if the tangential RF field is strong enough.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1472960/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  1961","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  1961","publicationDate":"July 1961","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"09 August 2005","volume":"8","issue":"4","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"On the heating of output windows of microwave tubes by electron bombardment","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the heating of output windows of microwave tubes by electron bombardment","sourcePdf":"01472960.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047239S","chronDate":"July  1961","isNumber":"31573","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4639142","citationCount":"46","articleId":"1472960","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1961","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1473023,"authors":[{"name":"J.

Calculations show that at sufficiently high collector current levels, the mobile space-charge density in the collector transition layer cannot be considered negligible in comparison to the fixed charge density of that region.

The structure is suitable for use as a high-power amplifier operating with a 20 per cent bandwidth in the millimeter-wave region.","doi":"10.1109/T-ED.1962.14975","publicationTitle":"IRE Transactions on Electron Devices","displayPublicationTitle":"IRE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel5/4639142/31578/01473203.pdf","startPage":"228","endPage":"234","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31578","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/T-ED.1962.14975","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A broad-band slow-wave structure for a millimeter traveling-wave tube amplifier","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1473203","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A broad-band slow-wave structure for a millimeter traveling-wave tube amplifier","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1473203/","volume":"9","issue":"2","publicationDate":"March 1962","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"09 August 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1962","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1962","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A broad-band slow-wave structure for a millimeter traveling-wave tube amplifier","sourcePdf":"01473203.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.031921S","chronDate":"March  1962","isNumber":"31578","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4639142","citationCount":"7","articleId":"1473203","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1962","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-20"},{"_id":1473215,"authors":[{"name":"T.C.

Thermal stress, caused by cooling from high temperature bonding operations, can cause fracture of the brittle part, due to thermal expansivity mismatch with other parts of the structure. This paper considers a widely used type of bond, consisting of a nonpenetrating butt-joint, wherein the parts develop thermal stresses by reason of shear constraint in a solder layer. This type of joint is therefore called a shear-constrained bond. A one-dimensional, elastic analytical model is presented, which predicts the location and orientation of the principal tensile stress in a shear-constrained brittle strip. The tensile stress required for brittle fracture is shown to be induced, primarily, by shear tractions in the solder layer which are applied to one face of the strip. Extended to a real structure, the model would predict the highest tensile stress at the outer periphery of a bond, and oriented at 45\u00b0 with the plane of the bond interface. This prediction is found to be in agreement with the bulk of fracture experience in shear-constrained semiconductors.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1962","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1962","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1473215/","volume":"9","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 1962","dateOfInsertion":"09 August 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Thermal stress and fracture in shear-constrained semiconductor device structures","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Thermal stress and fracture in shear-constrained semiconductor device structures","sourcePdf":"01473215.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037095S","chronDate":"May  1962","isNumber":"31579","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4639142","citationCount":"27","articleId":"1473215","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1962","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1473226,"authors":[{"name":"B.C.

By numerically integrating the carrier ionization rate in a junction space-charge layer, avalanche breakdown voltage is calculated for diffused diodes of silicon and germanium; this voltage is graphically illustrated throughout a range of parameters applicable to most practical situations. In addition, for calculating the maximum cutoff frequency of varactor diodes, junction capacity is similarly illustrated assuming the device is biased to avalanche breakdown. From these illustrations, and from an accompanying nomograph which relates the physical constants of a junction to its impurity atom gradient, the above parameters can be readily established without additional calculations. Further, examples are also presented to demonstrate the reduction of breakdown voltage resulting from a rapid increase of conductivity within the space-charge layer of a diffused p-n junction; this situation approximates many epitaxial and double diffused structures.","doi":"10.1109/T-ED.1962.15023","displayPublicationTitle":"IRE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel5/4639142/31582/01473251.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/T-ED.1962.15023","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31582","publicationTitle":"IRE Transactions on Electron Devices","startPage":"478","endPage":"483","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1962","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Avalanche breakdown characteristics of a diffused P-N junction","volume":"9","issue":"6","dateOfInsertion":"09 August 2005","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 1962","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1473251/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1962","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Avalanche breakdown characteristics of a diffused P-N junction","sourcePdf":"01473251.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.03866S","chronDate":"Nov.  1962","isNumber":"31582","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4639142","citationCount":"27","articleId":"1473251","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1962","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1473258,"authors":[{"name":"R.J.

CW power output exceeding 400 kilowatts has been obtained with an efficiency of 70% and gain of 9 db. Operation over a wide range of power output, from 150 to 400 kilowatts, has been achieved with substantially constant efficiency. Unique design features of the tube include high dissipation vanes which operate at a dissipation density of 5 kilowatts/cm\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n, a cold water cooled cathode which can withstand electron bombardment power density of several kilowatts/cm\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n, and an output window assembly which transmits power by radiation into a compact test load. The tube consists of dual cascaded Amplitron network assemblies in a common vacuum envelope. Gain is trimmed to equalize the power generated and dissipated in each stage. Since all parts of the structure are water cooled and no heater power is required, the resulting device is a cold metallic vacuum enclosure with potentially long life capability. Other typical properties of the Amplitron such as low operating voltage, low phase pushing, and phase linearity are preserved in the high power tube.

This multiplication is due to the created electron-hole pairs colliding with the lattice and creating more electron-hole pairs under the influence of the large biasing field. This paper presents a circuit analysis of this effect when using a high-speed silicon (Si) P-I-N photodiode and shows what the SNR bandwidth and Noise Equivalent Power (NEP) are under both normal bias conditions and avalanche bias conditions. It is shown that there is a substantial improvement in the NEP and SNR ratio at high frequencies when operating at avalanche so that the device may be made nearly shot noise limited if the multiplication factor\n<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">M</tex>\nis sufficiently large. Microwave measurements on such a high-speed diode gave gains greater than 30 dB with a SNR improvement of 13 dB at 1.45 Gc/s. The effect was observed at frequencies as high as 2.54 Gc/s and appeared to follow a linear 1/M law with bias voltage in the avalanche region with some deviation at large values of\n<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">M</tex>\n. The device SNR ratio at moderately high light levels is determined by the signal-to-shot noise ratio. A high modulation depth is found to be essential to reduce shot noise. Analysis of the diode circuit reveals that the detected signal power bandwidth product is a constant. The NEP is found to vary directly with the bandwidth in a pulse type system.

This structure permits operation of the pn photodiode in a photon flux integration mode. This mode of operation is based on the fact that if a pn junction is charged to a reverse voltage less than its breakdown voltage and then open circuited, the rate of decay of charge stored on the space charge capacitance with zero incident illumination is independent of junction area and can have a time constant in the order of tenths of a second. Under illumination this rate of decay of charge depends linearly on the intensity of the incident illumination. That is, the charge removed at any instant of time is proportional to the time integral of illumination. The insulated gate field effect transistor provides a high conductance when in the ON condition to charge the space charge capacitance and a very low conductance during the integration time. This structure lends itself very nicely to monolithic integration of linear arrays where individual photodetectors are sampled periodically on a time-shared basis. Such arrays may be sampled in any order providing the possibility of spatially preprocess information. This device provides not only better sensitivity but also improved S/N ratio over other electronic imaging devices. Several advantages offered by this device are: (1) linear dependence of signal on light intensity over several orders of magnitude; (2) electronically controllable sensitivity; (3) ease of integration into arrays for image sensing.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"1965","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1474155/","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"20-22 Oct. 1965","publicationDate":"1965","dateOfInsertion":"09 August 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A silicon photodevice to operate in a photon flux integrated mode","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A silicon photodevice to operate in a photon flux integrated mode","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"01474155.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.024105S","chronDate":"1965","isNumber":"31616","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9931","citationCount":"6","articleId":"1474155","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1965","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1474219,"authors":[{"name":"D.E.

Integral solutions of the time independent equations are well known. An integral solution of the time dependent equations is given for multiplication by one carrier only. An exact solution is given for multiplication by two carriers with equal ionization coefficients in a constant junction field. The Townsend equations are nonlinear because of space charge effects. It is shown, however, that the nonlinearity, which imposes an upper limit on the current multiplication possible, is not important until the total multiplied current approaches the space charge limited current for the junction. Assuming multiplication is due to one carrier, frequency response curves are calculated for constant and linear junction fields and for a generation rate, due to photon absorption, which is either uniform or given by a delta function at the junction boundary. The curves indicate a relatively slight dependence of the frequency response on multiplication. Frequency response curves are also given for multiplication by both carriers with equal ionization coefficients when the junction field is constant. In this case the frequency response decreases continuously as the multiplication is increased. For multiplication by two carriers with unequal ionization coefficients, the frequency response is independent of multiplication until the product of the multiplication and the ratio of the ionization coefficients approaches one. Thereafter the frequency response decreases with multiplication.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1474275/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1966","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1966","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"ED-13","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 1966","dateOfInsertion":"09 August 2005","displayDocTitle":"The frequency response of avalanching photodiodes","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The frequency response of avalanching photodiodes","sourcePdf":"01474275.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.030714S","chronDate":"March  1966","isNumber":"31619","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"48","articleId":"1474275","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1966","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1474279,"authors":[{"name":"H.

Amplification with a continuous drift field in cadmium sulfide is reported, and differences between surface- and bulk-wave amplifiers are discussed. Some operating characteristics and fabrication techniques for making electrode transducers on piezoelectric crystals are given, together with experimental results on several passive surface-wave devices.","doi":"10.1109/T-ED.1967.15926","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel5/16/31632/01474649.pdf","startPage":"181","endPage":"189","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31632","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/T-ED.1967.15926","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Surface elastic-wave propagation and amplification","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1474649","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Surface elastic-wave propagation and amplification","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1474649/","volume":"14","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 1967","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"09 August 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1967","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1967","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Surface elastic-wave propagation and amplification","sourcePdf":"01474649.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.035556S","chronDate":"Apr 1967","isNumber":"31632","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"35","articleId":"1474649","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1967","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-21"},{"_id":1474654,"authors":[{"name":"Wai-Kai Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Ohio University, Athens, OH, USA"],"lastName":"Wai-Kai Chen","id":"37087417306"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9383"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9646"}],"articleNumber":"1474654","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":100},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Electron Devices Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/eds/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1474654","abstract":"A general formula is derived for gain of a distributed amplifier using nonuniform lines but with image impedance match at each connection. A study of the gain formula shows that the rise of gain can be eliminated by having different propagation functions for the sections. Thus a new method of constructing amplifiers having constant gain is obtained. The new amplifier also shows pronounced improvement in transient response. In order to verify some of the theoretical predictions, an experimental amplifier of this type was built, and its characteristics studied.

This characteristic was used for studying the stability of parallel pairs of high-frequency high-power transistors. The thermal effect may cause the incremental emitter-base resistance to assume a negative value. This, in turn, will cause the current flow in a pair of transistors to be asymmetrical. The transition from symmetrical to asymmetrical current flow occurs at a power level which is determined by the nonshared thermal and electrical resistances. Stability to a higher current level can be obtained by increasing the nonshared emitter or base resistances or reducing the collector voltage. Higher currents can also be obtained by reducing the nonshared thermal resistances which indicates close thermal coupling between the two units is desirable.","doi":"10.1109/T-ED.1967.15939","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel5/16/31633/01474662.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31633","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/T-ED.1967.15939","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","startPage":"260","endPage":"263","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Thermal properties of high-power transistors","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1474662","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1967","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1967","displayDocTitle":"Thermal properties of high-power transistors","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1474662/","volume":"14","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 1967","dateOfInsertion":"09 August 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Thermal properties of high-power transistors","sourcePdf":"01474662.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.040698S","chronDate":"May 1967","isNumber":"31633","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"66","articleId":"1474662","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1967","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1474825,"authors":[{"name":"S.R.

This paper presents an analysis of appropriately selected collector voltage and current waveforms which determine the load impedance at the fundamental and harmonically related frequencies; these conditions define the ClassB \"optimum efficiency\" case with 100 percent collector efficiency and 1.27 times the conventional Class B value of output power. If the RF drive level is increased, and the collector voltage and current waveforms are appropriately selected so that the amplifier is overdriven, a different load impedance is determined; these conditions define the \"optimum power\" case with 1.46 times the conventional Class B value of output power and 88 percent collector efficiency. The \"optimum power\" case has the added advantage that the output power and collector efficiency are essentially constant over a predetermined range of drive level. Finally, the theory is verified by the construction and testing of a UHF power amplifier having a power output of 46 watts and an over-all dc to RF conversion efficiency of 65 percent with a 1 dB for 10.5- dB insensitivity of output power to RF drive.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A theoretical analysis and experimental confirmation of the optimally loaded and overdriven RF power amplifier","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","doi":"10.1109/T-ED.1967.16120","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel5/16/31640/01474843.pdf","startPage":"851","endPage":"857","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/T-ED.1967.16120","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31640","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1474843","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1474843/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1967","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1967","displayDocTitle":"A theoretical analysis and experimental confirmation of the optimally loaded and overdriven RF power amplifier","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"14","issue":"12","dateOfInsertion":"09 August 2005","publicationDate":"Dec. 1967","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A theoretical analysis and experimental confirmation of the optimally loaded and overdriven RF power amplifier","sourcePdf":"01474843.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.035603S","chronDate":"Dec 1967","isNumber":"31640","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"160","articleId":"1474843","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1967","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1474914,"authors":[{"name":"H.A.R.

The effects of dc, RF and space-charge forces are taken into account, and secondary emission from the sole electrode is included in the theory. Digital computer solutions indicate a gain threshold with RF drive, and that the inclusion of space-charge forces and secondary emission enhances the gain. A linearly decreasing magnetic field near the output also increases the gain. Approximate solutions based on a hard-kernel-bunch (HKB) model are shown to give excellent agreement with the computer solutions.","doi":"10.1109/T-ED.1968.16142","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel5/16/31643/01475044.pdf","startPage":"85","endPage":"97","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31643","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/T-ED.1968.16142","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Space-charge and secondary emission effects in a computer simulation of crossed-field distributed-emission amplifiers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1475044","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Space-charge and secondary emission effects in a computer simulation of crossed-field distributed-emission amplifiers","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1475044/","volume":"15","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 1968","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"09 August 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1968","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1968","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Space-charge and secondary emission effects in a computer simulation of crossed-field distributed-emission amplifiers","sourcePdf":"01475044.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.027219S","chronDate":"Feb 1968","isNumber":"31643","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"1","articleId":"1475044","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1968","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1475069,"authors":[{"name":"P.J.W.

The necessary circuitry to make a functional two-dimensional array is also described, including the scanning circuitry integrally constructed with the photodetector matrix. The necessary design considerations for operation of the matrix are discussed in the context of the currently operating 10-by-10 array. Extension of the principles to larger arrays is outlined in the two modes of array scanning considered, with special reference to spatial noise problems. The paper concludes with reference to other applications of the basic principle, such as card reading.","doi":"10.1109/T-ED.1968.16167","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel5/16/31645/01475069.pdf","startPage":"202","endPage":"209","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/T-ED.1968.16167","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31645","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Self-scanned silicon image detector arrays","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1475069/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1968","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1968","displayDocTitle":"Self-scanned silicon image detector arrays","volume":"15","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 1968","dateOfInsertion":"09 August 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Self-scanned silicon image detector arrays","sourcePdf":"01475069.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.022558S","chronDate":"Apr 1968","isNumber":"31645","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"85","articleId":"1475069","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1968","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1475091,"authors":[{"name":"H.C.

The oscillation frequency was continuously tunable over a 1.3-GHz range by a sliding short. 2) Phase-locking has been achieved with a maximum normalized gain-bandwidth product of 0.1. The minimum locking signal power required for a 500-MHz locking bandwidth was 20 dB below the oscillator output. 3) Electronic tuning of the oscillator frequency was demonstrated by placing a millimeter-wave varactor diode in the tuning circuit. The output frequency versus the bias voltage on the varactor diode was linear with maximum frequency deviation of 300 MHz. Frequency modulation of the oscillator by driving the varactor with a sinusoidal source was obtained at a modulation frequency of 50 MHz. 4) Stable amplification with 13-dB gain was obtained, centered at 52.885 GHz with a 3-dB bandwidth of 1 GHz. The maximum output power obtained was 16 mW. Higher gain of about 17 dB was obtained at a reduced bandwidth. The noise figure of the amplifier was 36 dB. Equivalent circuits for the oscillator and the amplifier are derived. The calculated results agree reasonably well with the experimental observations.","doi":"10.1109/T-ED.1968.16508","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel5/16/31651/01475410.pdf","startPage":"741","endPage":"747","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31651","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/T-ED.1968.16508","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 50-GHz silicon IMPATT diode oscillator and amplifier","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1475410","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A 50-GHz silicon IMPATT diode oscillator and amplifier","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1475410/","volume":"15","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 1968","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"09 August 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1968","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1968","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 50-GHz silicon IMPATT diode oscillator and amplifier","sourcePdf":"01475410.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.066366S","chronDate":"Oct 1968","isNumber":"31651","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"5","articleId":"1475410","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1968","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1475426,"authors":[{"name":"N.B.

The frequency of operation and the type of circuit dictate the turn-off time and dv/dt which are required of a device. These two parameters are established by suitable gold doping to control the minority carrier lifetime and by employing \"shorted emitter\" techniques to ccntrol the low current alpha's of the device. In addition, at high currents and voltages, a thyristor's capability of withstanding steep wavefront, high current pulses (i.e., di/dt capability) often also proves to be a major limiting factor in its application. This characteristic is primarily determined by the instantaneous junction temperature; thus, it is essential that localized heating be minimized. Unfortunately, this problem is aggravated by increased dissipation resulting from the lower lifetime that is required to achieve the short turn-off time. In order to minimize the instantaneous temperature rise, a substantial increase in effective conducting area during the turn-on interval is required.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31654","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IEDM.1968.188036","publicationTitle":"1968 International Electron Devices Meeting","displayPublicationTitle":"1968 International Electron Devices Meeting","pdfPath":"/iel5/9934/31654/01475561.pdf","startPage":"110","endPage":"110","doi":"10.1109/IEDM.1968.188036","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The amplifying gate thyristor","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"1968","displayDocTitle":"The amplifying gate thyristor","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"23-25 Oct. 1968","publicationDate":"1968","dateOfInsertion":"09 August 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1475561/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The amplifying gate thyristor","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"01475561.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.019243S","chronDate":"1968","isNumber":"31654","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9934","citationCount":"2","articleId":"1475561","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1968","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1475609,"authors":[{"name":"D.L.

Phase one of the investigation demonstrated experimentally that current-gain temperature dependence is an inverse log function of the average active base resistivity. Devices were found to be less temperature sensitive with lighter base doping levels. Phase two of the investigation experimentally demonstrated current-gain temperature dependence to be an inverse exponential function of the emitter doping level. This large temperature dependence is shown to be a possible consequence of an emitter band-gap decrease, presumably caused by the large number of dislocations and lattice deformations at high doping levels. Using the predicted techniques, several runs of epitaxial planar devices were fabricated which had practically no current-gain temperature dependence, and suffered no noticeable loss in other parameters. Current-gain temperature dependence is also thought to be one of the contributors to hot-spot formation and secondary breakdown. To determine if secondary-breakdown capability had been increased, these temperature-insensitive devices were tested to forward secondary breakdown and compared to standard products of the same geometry. The temperature-independent devices were able to withstand a 40-percent increase in operating power before the onset of secondary breakdown. This increase in capability is thought to be the result of less tendency toward hot-spot formation due to decreased thermal regenerative action.","doi":"10.1109/T-ED.1969.16573","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel5/16/31655/01475616.pdf","startPage":"117","endPage":"124","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/T-ED.1969.16573","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31655","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Investigation of current-gain temperature dependence in silicon transistors","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1475616","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1969","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1969","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1475616/","displayDocTitle":"Investigation of current-gain temperature dependence in silicon transistors","volume":"16","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 1969","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"09 August 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Investigation of current-gain temperature dependence in silicon transistors","sourcePdf":"01475616.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.032896S","chronDate":"Jan 1969","isNumber":"31655","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"19","articleId":"1475616","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1969","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":1475786,"authors":[{"name":"J.S.

Particular attention was given to the effect on array reliability of the additional processing steps required to obtain multilevel metalization. The additional significant steps are low temperature deposition of a second dielectric layer on metalized LSI wafers, etching of vias through the second dielectric, and second level metalization. Consideration was also given to the effect of other trends in LSI, such as the use of smaller geometry and closer spacings. Possible new failure modes in multilevel arrays are: 1) shorts or increased leakage through or along deposited second layer dielectrics, 2) opens or increased series resistance in conductors, and 3) silicon surface effects. A review of literature on LSI was supplemented by results of a number of concurrent LSI programs and experimental studies. Test vehicles were designed to provide fundamental information about each of the categories of failure. Data obtained using these test vehicles to evaluate the multilevel metalized array structures are presented. A discussion concerning the merits and limitations of the specially designed test vehicles for process development, process control, and reliability tests is given. It is concluded that with the proper in-process controls, tests and screens, LSI arrays will be substantially more reliable per function accomplished than are conventional integrated circuits.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31658","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel5/16/31658/01475794.pdf","doi":"10.1109/T-ED.1969.16752","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/T-ED.1969.16752","startPage":"322","endPage":"332","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Failure mechanisms in large-scale integrated circuits","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1969","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1969","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1475794/","displayDocTitle":"Failure mechanisms in large-scale integrated circuits","isJournal":true,"volume":"16","issue":"4","dateOfInsertion":"09 August 2005","publicationDate":"April 1969","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Failure mechanisms in large-scale integrated circuits","sourcePdf":"01475794.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037956S","chronDate":"Apr 1969","isNumber":"31658","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"23","articleId":"1475794","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1969","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":1475796,"authors":[{"name":"J.R.

Integrated circuits of minimum linewidths of 0.5 mil have been fabricated to show the practicality of the technique through the full set of mask exposures necessary for a DZTL quad dual input NAND gate. The necessary alignments between successive masks were achieved by an optical dead reckoning technique which allowed the electron image to be adjusted in position and orientation from a known \"zero\" position to the separately determined location of the pre-existing pattern on the sample. Accuracy of such alignments was \u00b1 2 micron. The much more desirable alignment technique, in which simple devices in the form of alignment marks on the target wafer detect separate electron beams emanating from the cathode, allows rapid alignment to submicron registration and the potential for the complete automation of alignment and exposure. The system provides for the rapid registration and exposure of wafers at high resolution over large areas with great depth of focus under vacuum clean, contactless conditions using an electroresist insensitive to ambient light. It makes practical the fabrication of very high-density planar devices allowing extremely complex large area circuits to be formed. Patterned photocathodes were fabricated by conventional photoresist techniques for the DZTL circuit discussed. For high-resolution (1 micron) patterns, cathodes can be defined in the electron micro-plotter (computer-controlled scanning electron microscope).","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel5/16/31673/01476194.pdf","startPage":"465","endPage":"469","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","doi":"10.1109/T-ED.1970.17010","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/T-ED.1970.17010","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31673","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1476194","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fabrication of integrated circuits using the electron image projection system (ELIPS)","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1476194/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1970","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1970","displayDocTitle":"Fabrication of integrated circuits using the electron image projection system (ELIPS)","volume":"17","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 1970","dateOfInsertion":"09 August 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fabrication of integrated circuits using the electron image projection system (ELIPS)","sourcePdf":"01476194.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.01645S","chronDate":"Jun 1970","isNumber":"31673","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"2","articleId":"1476194","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1970","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":1476236,"authors":[{"name":"Y.C.

A design for a self-scanned bucket-brigade sensor that can be fabricated upon a monolithic silicon wafer with a single diffusion and one layer of metallization is proposed. An experimental array has been built comprising 15 rows of 32 series-connected MOS transistors whose sources and drains serve as photodiodes. These transistors are interconnected to adjacent horizontal buses so that each row can function independently as a shift register. In operation, each register remains inactive for a period of time during which an image charge pattern is built up on the photodiodes. The application of the horizontal clock pulses to that row causes the charge pattern to be transferred stepwise to the edge of the array where it is converted into a video signal. Although in the test sample the gating of the horizontal clock pulses to successive rows was accomplished by means of an external vertical scan generator, this could be replaced by an integrated vertical register formed on the same chip with the sensor.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Self-scanned image sensors based upon bucket-brigade scanning","publicationTitle":"1970 International Electron Devices Meeting","doi":"10.1109/IEDM.1970.188295","displayPublicationTitle":"1970 International Electron Devices Meeting","pdfPath":"/iel5/9936/31680/01476407.pdf","startPage":"106","endPage":"108","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IEDM.1970.188295","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31680","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1476407","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1476407/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1970","displayDocTitle":"Self-scanned image sensors based upon bucket-brigade scanning","conferenceDate":"28-30 Oct. 1970","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"09 August 2005","publicationDate":"1970","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Self-scanned image sensors based upon bucket-brigade scanning","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"01476407.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.036063S","chronDate":"1970","isNumber":"31680","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9936","citationCount":"1","articleId":"1476407","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1970","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1476494,"authors":[{"name":"B.R.

The analysis of the energy spread in a realistic model of the beam shows that the maximum efficiency attainable (with collector depression) is limited by the nonzero size of the beam and the nonzero space-charge density. Considering practical limitations of the beam parameters and the saturation characteristics, possible design parameters for high-efficiency, transverse-wave tubes operating at moderate power levels have been obtained. The attainment of such goals with reasonable circuit length appears possible but difficult, mainly due to relatively low interaction impedance available for transverse-wave interactions.","doi":"10.1109/T-ED.1971.17234","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel5/16/31688/01476556.pdf","startPage":"511","endPage":"520","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31688","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/T-ED.1971.17234","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Transverse-wave tubes as high-efficiency microwave amplifiers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1476556","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Transverse-wave tubes as high-efficiency microwave amplifiers","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1476556/","volume":"18","issue":"8","publicationDate":"Aug. 1971","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"09 August 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1971","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1971","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Transverse-wave tubes as high-efficiency microwave amplifiers","sourcePdf":"01476556.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.027197S","chronDate":"Aug 1971","isNumber":"31688","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"4","articleId":"1476556","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1971","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":1476613,"authors":[{"name":"H.J.J.

The distribution of the defects is represented in terms of density and modeled as follows : 1) they are randomly distributed within a limited area; 2) the density in a wafer changes concentrically; and 3) the density is normally distributed from wafer to wafer with uniform deviation throughout a wafer. The yield degradation phenomenon due to such defects has been analyzed using a computer simulation technique. The effect of density variations in a wafer and between wafers has been mainly investigated. An extensive numerical study leads to the following conclusions. 1) The deviation of the yield versus chip-area relation from the simple exponential law is influenced more greatly by the nonuniform defect distribution in a wafer than by the density variation between wafers. 2) The increase of average yield due to the density variation between wafers is sometimes offset by the decrease of the accuracy in yield prediction. Process stabilization is essential for the economical production of a few large-scale chips.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1972","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1972","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1476867/","volume":"19","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 1972","dateOfInsertion":"09 August 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Yield degradation of integrated circuits due to spot defects","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Yield degradation of integrated circuits due to spot defects","sourcePdf":"01476867.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.03452S","chronDate":"Feb 1972","isNumber":"31695","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"38","articleId":"1476867","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1972","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":1476878,"authors":[{"name":"Horng-Sen Fu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Materials Research Laboratory, University of Illinois, Urbana, IL, USA"],"lastName":"Horng-Sen Fu","id":"37067708300"},{"name":"Chih-Tang Sah","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Materials Research Laboratory, University of Illinois, Urbana, IL, USA"],"lastName":"Chih-Tang Sah","id":"37067144900"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9383"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9646"}],"articleNumber":"1476878","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":83,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":618},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Electron Devices Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/eds/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1476878","doi":"10.1109/T-ED.1972.17407","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel5/16/31695/01476878.pdf","startPage":"273","endPage":"285","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/T-ED.1972.17407","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31695","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Theory and experiments on surface 1/f noise","abstract":"A theoretical low-frequency noise model for the epitaxial-channel surface field-effect structure is presented where random modulation of the channel conductance arises from fluctuation of charges trapped at the oxide trap states near the Si-SiO\n<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</inf>\ninterface. In this model, charge fluctuation in the oxide traps arises from carrier tunneling between the fast interface surface states and the oxide trap states. A second fluctuation, at higher frequencies, arises from the random thermal emission and capture of electrons and holes at the fast interface states through the thermal or Shockley-Read-Hall process. Different oxide trap densities were introduced into the interface region of the metal-oxide-silicon field-effect structures using a carefully controlled and reproducible oxygen heat treatment technique. Energy distributions of the oxide trap densities are obtained from capacitance measurements. Humps are observed between the flat band and the onset of strong surface inversion (lower half of the bandgap) in both the noise power and the oxide trap density versus gate voltage (or surface band bending) plots.

The effects of interaction between the device basic noise sources, the small-signal model parameters, and the signal source admittance parameters are clearly indicated. The noise performance is found to be essentially determined by the effective surface-state density and the gate insulator thickness product (\n<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">N_{ss}t_{ox}</tex>\n) in the case of MOSFET's, whereas in the case of JFET's, this is determined by the bulk density of impurity and/or defect generation-recombination (g-r) centers within the depletion region and the half-channel height squared product (\n<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">N_{TT}a^{2}</tex>\n). Although an increase in the gate electrode area can reduce the equivalent gate noise resistance, this does not improve the noise performance of the device. Quantitative results based on typical device parameters are graphically presented with proper indications as to the upper limit of the LF range, the excess minimum noise figure, and the frequency range within which the noise figure remains below 3 dB level for specified source resistance values.

It is shown that in the near infrared, cooled avalanche photodiodes can compare favorably with the best available photomultiplier when used either in a photon-counting mode, or for the reliable detection of low-level laser pulses.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31699","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel5/16/31699/01476956.pdf","doi":"10.1109/T-ED.1972.17485","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/T-ED.1972.17485","startPage":"703","endPage":"713","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The distribution of gains in uniformly multiplying avalanche photodiodes: Theory","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  1972","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  1972","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1476956/","displayDocTitle":"The distribution of gains in uniformly multiplying avalanche photodiodes: Theory","isJournal":true,"volume":"19","issue":"6","dateOfInsertion":"09 August 2005","publicationDate":"June 1972","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The distribution of gains in uniformly multiplying avalanche photodiodes: Theory","sourcePdf":"01476956.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.035013S","chronDate":"June  1972","isNumber":"31699","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"316","articleId":"1476956","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1972","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1476957,"authors":[{"name":"J.

The charge-coupled structures considered have separations between the gates equal to the thickness of the channel oxide. The effect of each of the above mechanisms on charge transfer is first considered separately, and a new method is presented for the calculation of the self-induced field. Then the results of a computer simulation of the charge-transfer process that simultaneously considers all three charge-motion mechanisms is presented for three-phase CCD's with gate lengths of 4 and 10 \u00b5. The analysis shows that while the majority of the charge is transferred by means of the self-induced drift that follows a hyperbolic time dependence, the last few percent of the charge decays exponentially under the influence of the fringing field drift or thermal diffusion, depending on the design of the structure. The analysis shows that in CCD's made on relatively high resistivity substrates, the transfer by fringing-field drift can be very fast, such that transfer efficiencies of 99.99 percent are expected at 5- to 10- MHz bit rates for 10-\u00b5 gate lengths and at up to 100 MHz for 4-\u00b5 gate lengths.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Free charge transfer in charge-coupled devices","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","doi":"10.1109/T-ED.1972.17497","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel5/16/31699/01476968.pdf","startPage":"798","endPage":"808","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/T-ED.1972.17497","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31699","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1476968","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1476968/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1972","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1972","displayDocTitle":"Free charge transfer in charge-coupled devices","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"19","issue":"6","dateOfInsertion":"09 August 2005","publicationDate":"June 1972","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Free charge transfer in charge-coupled devices","sourcePdf":"01476968.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.026032S","chronDate":"Jun 1972","isNumber":"31699","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"40","articleId":"1476968","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1972","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1476971,"authors":[{"name":"K.I.

The normal current in the thin oxide MNOS structures is assumed to be a modified Fowler-Nordheim current. At small oxide thicknesses and low nitride field, an additional current is shown to exist that is attributed to direct tunneling into traps in the nitride.

Experimental and analytical studies show that incomplete charge transfer is an important limitation of register performance leading to signal degradation. This sets an upper limit to the clock frequency and to the number of stages in the register. The effects leading to incomplete charge transfer include: 1) the finite rate at which charge moves from one capacitor to the next through the IGFET transconductance; 2) the reduction in transfer rate (due to IGFET output conductance) when part of the charge has already been transferred to the drain; and 3) the loss of charge to interface states. The relative importance of these effects depends on device structure, clock frequency, clock voltage amplitude, and waveform. Under most operating conditions the IGFET output conductance contribution is most important, and the best results were obtained with a structure that minimized the effect. Experimental data show that p-channel registers in 31-bit strings can be operated satisfactorily to clock frequencies in excess of 5 MHz, and that by appropriate register design significantly better performance should be possible.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel5/16/31700/01476980.pdf","startPage":"852","endPage":"860","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","doi":"10.1109/T-ED.1972.17509","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/T-ED.1972.17509","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31700","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1476980","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance limitations of the IGFET bucket-brigade shift register","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1476980/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1972","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1972","displayDocTitle":"Performance limitations of the IGFET bucket-brigade shift register","volume":"19","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 1972","dateOfInsertion":"09 August 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance limitations of the IGFET bucket-brigade shift register","sourcePdf":"01476980.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073797S","chronDate":"Jul 1972","isNumber":"31700","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"24","articleId":"1476980","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1972","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1477003,"authors":[{"name":"A.F.

Monolithic circuits with high speed npn's and lateral pnp's can be made with high slew rates, but only at the expense of standby power. As this power becomes too large to remove from the chip, the performance is limited. Compatible, complementary pnp's allow the node capacitances to be charged with high currents with low standby power, thus allowing a significant increase in circuit performance. The triple diffused vertical pnp's reported earlier are not acceptable in amplifiers because of the low collector-emitter breakdown of approximately 7.5 volts. A similar acceptable two epi process has been reported using diffusion, however, the process described herein provides much tighter control on device parameters.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Operational amplifiers","Epitaxial layers","Substrates","Boron","MOSFET circuits","Ion implantation","Conductivity","Oxidation","Monolithic integrated circuits","High power amplifiers"]}],"doi":"10.1109/IEDM.1972.249233","publicationTitle":"1972 International Electron Devices Meeting","displayPublicationTitle":"1972 International Electron Devices Meeting","pdfPath":"/iel5/9938/31706/01477076.pdf","startPage":"18","endPage":"20","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31706","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IEDM.1972.249233","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Ion implanted, compatible, complementary PNP's for high slew rate operational amplifiers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1477076","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Ion implanted, compatible, complementary PNP's for high slew rate operational amplifiers","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1477076/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1972","conferenceDate":"4-6 Dec. 1972","dateOfInsertion":"09 August 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"1972","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ion implanted, compatible, complementary PNP's for high slew rate operational amplifiers","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"01477076.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069943S","chronDate":"1972","isNumber":"31706","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9938","citationCount":"6","articleId":"1477076","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1972","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1477080,"authors":[{"name":"G.A.

The limitations on transfer efficiency may be minimized by using a background charge in the device at all times. Experimental measurements of transfer inefficiency on three-phase devices and a two-phase device are presented and correlated with the predicted values, although measurements of the density and capture cross sections of interface states after device fabrication are required for accurate quantitative predictions of transfer inefficiencies. It is concluded that trapping effects are a limitation on the transfer efficiencies obtainable in surface channel charge-coupled devices, particularly, for example, at frequencies less than 1 MHz for devices having 10-\u00b5m-long transfer electrodes, but are not a direct limitation on the high-frequency performance. The effect of interface states in adding transfer noise onto the charge packets is also described, and is shown to be small, although in some devices it may reduce the signal-to-noise ratios that might otherwise be possible.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The quantitative effects of interface states on the performance of charge-coupled devices","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","doi":"10.1109/T-ED.1973.17607","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel5/16/31707/01477264.pdf","startPage":"45","endPage":"55","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/T-ED.1973.17607","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31707","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1477264","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1477264/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1973","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1973","displayDocTitle":"The quantitative effects of interface states on the performance of charge-coupled devices","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"20","issue":"1","dateOfInsertion":"09 August 2005","publicationDate":"Jan. 1973","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The quantitative effects of interface states on the performance of charge-coupled devices","sourcePdf":"01477264.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033938S","chronDate":"Jan 1973","isNumber":"31707","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"18","articleId":"1477264","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1973","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1477273,"authors":[{"name":"S.R.

The structural changes can be initiated by various forms of energy such as an electrical pulse, a short light pulse, or a brief light exposure. Many materials show good structural reversibility. The sensitivity of an amorphous photostructural film is amplified by several orders of magnitude by first forming a latent image by photonucleation and subsequent dry development by heat or radiation.

An efficient way to achieve such a readout from charge-coupled area imaging devices of the frame transfer type is described. The resolution cells of the device are elongated in the vertical dimension to extend across the distance corresponding to two scanning lines in the display. For the two fields forming a full frame the charge generated by the incident light is integrated alternately underneath different sets of electrodes. Experimental results obtained on a 64 \u00d7 106 element frame transfer array are presented and compared to theory. They show that in a three-phase structure, by alternately integrating the charge underneath electrodes number 1 and numbers 2+3 jointly, the vertical resolution can be improved by about a factor of 2. This results in a limiting resolution in the vertical direction of about 75 percent of that given by the spatial pitch of the transfer cells. The value 75 percent is characteristic of all raster scanned imaging devices and is a result of the line scanned display. The usefulness of this scheme for line imaging devices is also discussed but is dismissed as being inferior to a bilinear approach with separate interdigitated integration sites.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel5/16/31712/01477351.pdf","startPage":"535","endPage":"541","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","doi":"10.1109/T-ED.1973.17694","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/T-ED.1973.17694","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31712","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1477351","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Interlacing in charge-coupled imaging devices","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1477351/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1973","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1973","displayDocTitle":"Interlacing in charge-coupled imaging devices","volume":"20","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 1973","dateOfInsertion":"09 August 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Interlacing in charge-coupled imaging devices","sourcePdf":"01477351.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.027053S","chronDate":"Jun 1973","isNumber":"31712","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"7","articleId":"1477351","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1973","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1477376,"authors":[{"name":"C.H.

The principles of this method have been published earlier [1]. This paper discusses in detail the method and a number of considerable improvements. Poisson's equation and the two continuity equations are discretized on two networks of different rectangular meshes. The 2D continuity equations are approximated by a set of difference equations assuming that the hole and electron current density components along the meshlines are constant between two neighboring meshpoints in a way similar to that used by Gummel and Scharfetter [2] for the one-dimensional (1D) continuity equations. The resulting difference approximations have generally a much larger validity range than the conventional difference formulations where it is assumed that the change in electrostatic potential between two neighboring points is small compared with\n<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">k T/q</tex>\n. Therefore, a much smaller number of meshpoints is necessary than for the conventional difference approximations. This reduces considerably the computation time and the required memory space. It will be shown that the matrix of the coefficients of this set of difference equations is always positive definite. This is an important property and guarantees convergence and stability of the numerical solution of the continuity equations. The way in which the difference approximations for the continuity equations are derived gives directly consistent expressions for the current densities that can be used for calculating the currents. In order to demonstrate the kind of solutions obtainable, steady-state results for a bipolar n-p-n silicon transistor are presented and discussed.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Computer-aided two-dimensional analysis of bipolar transistors","doi":"10.1109/T-ED.1973.17727","startPage":"669","endPage":"679","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/T-ED.1973.17727","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31714","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel5/16/31714/01477384.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1477384","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug.  1973","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1477384/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  1973","displayDocTitle":"Computer-aided two-dimensional analysis of bipolar transistors","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"20","issue":"8","dateOfInsertion":"09 August 2005","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 1973","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Computer-aided two-dimensional analysis of bipolar transistors","sourcePdf":"01477384.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.059582S","chronDate":"Aug.  1973","isNumber":"31714","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"21","articleId":"1477384","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1973","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1477402,"authors":[{"name":"R.P.

IGFET source-drain breakdown occurs at voltages less than drain-junction avalanche breakdown; this voltage decreases with decreasing channel length. Source-drain breakdown can be induced by increasing gate biasing voltage. Moreover, a large breakdown current is often sustained after removing the gate voltage. In this situations the IGFET \"latches\" in a source-drain breakdown mode. IGFET source-drain breakdown can be attributed to the extrinsic (or parasitic) bipolar transistor in parallel with the intrinsic IGFET structure. Carrier multiplication within the drain space-charge layer produces a substrate potential distribution that turns on this parasitic region; thus, IGFET source-drain breakdown is equivalent to emitter-collector breakdown (BV\n<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">CEX</inf>\n) for a bipolar transistor.

Bright lines are formed in the display, owing to a charge propagation along the transfer channels. The introduction of overflow drains, i.e., stripes of a reverse-biased p-n junction placed between the transfer channels, provides a well-defined leakage path for excess carriers from saturated potential wells. An implanted threshold barrier between these drains and the integrating potential wells determines the saturation potential of the integration sites and prevents the total collapse of the associated depletion region. Therefore, the lateral diffusion of minority carriers is also greatly reduced. An existing design of a charge-coupled area image sensor with 64 \u00d7 106 resolution elements and frame transfer organization has been modified to study these methods of blooming suppression. The lateral distance of charge spreading has been reduced by a factor of seven at overload conditions of 20 dB. For stronger overloads the booming suppression becomes even more striking, but the performance of the device iS limited by frame transfer smearing. Furthermore, lens flare limits most optical systems at overloads above 30 dB. However, by using an optical fiber, well-localized overloads of 50 dB could be generated. Although, in our particular test device, the addition of blooming suppression reduced the light sensitivity by a factor of four, other geometries for overflow drain structures that should result in only a negligible loss in sensitivity are discussed.","doi":"10.1109/T-ED.1974.17925","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel5/16/31725/01477740.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/T-ED.1974.17925","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31725","startPage":"331","endPage":"341","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Measurements on a charge-coupled area image sensor with blooming suppression","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1477740","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Measurements on a charge-coupled area image sensor with blooming suppression","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1974","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1477740/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1974","isJournal":true,"volume":"21","issue":"6","publicationDate":"June 1974","dateOfInsertion":"09 August 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Measurements on a charge-coupled area image sensor with blooming suppression","sourcePdf":"01477740.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.089117S","chronDate":"Jun 1974","isNumber":"31725","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"4","articleId":"1477740","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1974","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1477758,"authors":[{"name":"L.A.

In this case, when the channel has not yet pinched off, the characteristics are ohmic and then the transistor can operate as a good variable resistor; on the other hand, when the channel has already pinched, the transistor shows the build-up characteristics similar to those of a vacuum tube triode as a result of the static induction from the drain. The transistor similar to that of the vacuum tube triode type is named \"Static Induction Transistor,\" because its output character is based on the static induction as well as input characteristics. The SIT has the exponential characteristics in contrast with the \"Analog Transistor\" which is expected by Shockley to follow the space-charge conduction law. The SIT has already been ascertained to have low noise, low distortion, and high-power capability, and its fabrication has been already realized in the form of a high-power transistor (2 kW, 8 MHz), a high-frequency transistor (a few watts, UHF), and a high-speed thyristor. Microwave transistors and very high-speed integrated circuits are being constructed, as well as variable resistors.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Field-effect transistor versus analog transistor (static induction transistor)","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","doi":"10.1109/T-ED.1975.18103","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel5/16/31736/01477938.pdf","startPage":"185","endPage":"197","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/T-ED.1975.18103","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31736","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1477938","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1477938/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April  1975","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  1975","displayDocTitle":"Field-effect transistor versus analog transistor (static induction transistor)","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"22","issue":"4","dateOfInsertion":"09 August 2005","publicationDate":"April 1975","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Field-effect transistor versus analog transistor (static induction transistor)","sourcePdf":"01477938.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.058944S","chronDate":"April  1975","isNumber":"31736","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"305","articleId":"1477938","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1975","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1477954,"authors":[{"name":"R.J.

It is also capable of exposing patterns directly on resist-coated silicon wafers and, when so used, is an effective tool with which to develop new semiconductor devices. EBES combines continuous translation of the mask or wafer substrate with periodic deflection of the electron beam in a raster-scan mode of exposure. Substrate position is monitored by means of laser interferometers. The strategy permits both the electronic and mechanical subsystems to work well within their limits of capability and contributes to system reliability. It also permits the system to be stepped up to higher resolution and faster exposure as brighter electron sources, more sensitive resist, and faster data processing techniques are developed.","doi":"10.1109/T-ED.1975.18149","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel5/16/31739/01477984.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31739","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/T-ED.1975.18149","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","startPage":"385","endPage":"392","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"EBES: A practical electron lithographic system","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1477984","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1975","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1975","displayDocTitle":"EBES: A practical electron lithographic system","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1477984/","volume":"22","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 1975","dateOfInsertion":"09 August 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"EBES: A practical electron lithographic system","sourcePdf":"01477984.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043509S","chronDate":"Jul 1975","isNumber":"31739","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"93","articleId":"1477984","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1975","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1477996,"authors":[{"name":"F.H.

Loss measurements for the MIS microstrip structure confirm the predictred frequency dependence of the attenuation constant. While the levels of measured attenuation presently achieved are fairly high (4.5 dB/cm at 1 GHz), several methods for reducing the attenuation are proposed.

A parallel charge-transfer channel, which balances both capacitance and background charge, and a coupling diffusion between split electrodes greatly improves accuracy. A one-phase clock is used to simplify the readout circuitry. Two off-chip readout circuits are described, and the performance of two low-pass filters using these readout circuits is given.

It is shown that these As layers form linearly graded junctions with a uniform B-doped background (\u03c1 \u2243 0.006 \u03a9.cm). The grade constant of the As profile at the junction is known sufficiently well as a function of As dose, diffusion time, and temperature to allow quantitative use of existing tunneling and avalanche theories for the calculation of the reverse I-V curves. Following a verification of the calculated I-V curves and their temperature dependence as a function of grade constant, calculated curves are presented which correlate As implant dose and diffusion with junction breakdown voltage, breakdown impedance, and temperature coefficient of reverse voltage. The temperature coefficient is shown to change from negative to positive as the transition from tunneling to avalanche occurs. In addition, the relative importance of tunneling and multiplied-generation current as a function of current density is elucidated for any particular As layer grade constant.","doi":"10.1109/T-ED.1976.18438","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel5/16/31750/01478452.pdf","startPage":"512","endPage":"518","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/T-ED.1976.18438","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31750","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Zener and avalanche breakdown in As-implanted low-voltage Si n-p junctions","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1478452","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1976","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1976","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1478452/","displayDocTitle":"Zener and avalanche breakdown in As-implanted low-voltage Si n-p junctions","volume":"23","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 1976","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"09 August 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Zener and avalanche breakdown in As-implanted low-voltage Si n-p junctions","sourcePdf":"01478452.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.032189S","chronDate":"May 1976","isNumber":"31750","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"59","articleId":"1478452","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1976","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1478464,"authors":[{"name":"K.

The model is based on a physical picture revealed through two-dimensional numerical analysis. The two-dimensional analysis shows that the electron concentration changes gradually at the boundary of a depleted region which is defined by a conventional theory. Because of this gradual change, electrons can remain after the pinch-off and contribute to the drain current. Although the high electric field causes the electron velocity to saturate, the drift velocity vector rotates into the x axis (source-to-drain) with the increase in the drain voltage. The increase in the x component V\n<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">x</inf>\nof the drift velocity gives rise to a small increase in drain current, that is, a finite drain conductance. The proposed model takes into account the above two essential features, gradual change in electron distribution, and the rotation of the velocity vector. This model is constructed in a single formulation which describes the current-voltage characteristics from the linear to the saturated drain-current region.

Bell Laboratories' \"transistor group to be\" for the next eighteen months focused, not on practical, but on scientific aspects of the failure. Focus on the practical resumed (with a step-function increase, lasting several months, in \"the will to think\" about new concepts of semiconductor amplifiers, as measured by the rate of filling of laboratory notebook pages by Bardeen, Brattain, and Shockley) on 17 November 1947, when in his surface-state research, Brattain penetrated the shield by applying the field through an electrolyte. Within six days, patentable field-effect transistor inventions were conceived. Although useless as devices, these inventions were creative failures used by Bardeen and Brattain to discover the point-contact transistor three weeks later. Five weeks after this discovery, Shockley conceived the junction transistor while designing \"imref\" experiments on the point-contact transistor's inversion layer so that in 1951, the point-contact transistor in its turn became a creative failure when replaced by the junction transistor whose conception it had aided. But the path of thought to the conception of the junction transistor and the subsequent path to its practical realization are proven to be highly indirect by historical research on laboratory notebook entries. Specifically, Shockley's conception of the junction transistor was delayed by at least four months because he missed opportunities, obvious by hindsight, to recognize the possibility of minority carrier injection. The author hopes that the presentation of details of his limitations in making this important invention may help readers to accept their own limitations and, thereby, to become more persistent and, hence, creative.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1976","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1976","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1478477/","volume":"23","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 1976","dateOfInsertion":"09 August 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"The path to the conception of the junction transistor","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The path to the conception of the junction transistor","sourcePdf":"01478477.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.051472S","chronDate":"Jul 1976","isNumber":"31752","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"11","articleId":"1478477","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1976","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1478478,"authors":[{"name":"G.K.

The analysis covers the wide range of device geometry from the state of the art FET to the so-called Gunn effect digital devices. It is found that a GaAs FET exhibits either of the following three types of characteristics depending upon device geometry and doping concentration. First, for a thin channel with high doping concentration, the device tends to behave as a normal junction-gate FET with saturating current-voltage characteristics. This is even true when the n-l (device length) and n.d (device thickness) products exceed the previously accepted criteria for Gunn oscillation. Second, a stable negative resistance (SNR) is observed in devices with a moderate channel thickness. Third, for a thick channel, the device exhibits a Gunn oscillation with the domain propagating from the gate edge to the drain. These three categories of behavior are mapped on the nd plane with the help of simple analytic considerations.

Specific attention in the paper is directed to oxide defect failures. The temperature and time dependence of these failures is examined and compared to actual device failure rates. Methods of screening defective oxides in actual RAMS are discussed.

In the analytic part of the effort, three-dimensional electron trajectories are computed throughout the TWT. Trajectory computation continues through the spent beam refocuser and the depressed collector. Collector efficiency, collector losses, and overall efficiency are identified and computed. On the experimental side, tube performance is evaluated first without the MDC; then, the spent beam is analyzed for symmetry, circularity, and velocity spread. Finally, the MDC is attached and its performance optimized and evaluated. The three-dimensional theory, for ideal tubes, predicts a MDC-efficiency, at mid-band, of 81 percent for a 2-stage MDC with symmetric, circular, and optimally refocused beams and 85.5 percent for a 4-stage MDC. Experimental results to date have yielded MDC efficiencies of a minimum of 81 and 83 percent for a 2- and 4-stage MDC, respectively, across a one-octave bandwidth of a 4.8 to 9.6 GHz 330-to-550-W TWT.","doi":"10.1109/T-ED.1977.18675","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel5/16/31759/01478867.pdf","startPage":"36","endPage":"44","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/T-ED.1977.18675","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31759","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Small-size 81- to 83.5-percent efficient 2- and 4-stage depressed collectors for octave-bandwidth high-performance TWT's","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1478867","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1977","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1977","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1478867/","displayDocTitle":"Small-size 81- to 83.5-percent efficient 2- and 4-stage depressed collectors for octave-bandwidth high-performance TWT's","volume":"24","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 1977","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"09 August 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Small-size 81- to 83.5-percent efficient 2- and 4-stage depressed collectors for octave-bandwidth high-performance TWT's","sourcePdf":"01478867.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.045905S","chronDate":"Jan 1977","isNumber":"31759","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"9","articleId":"1478867","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1977","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1478881,"authors":[{"name":"H.M.

Most profiles of interest are quasi-neutral, i.e., the spatial dependence of the majority carriers in the undepleted bulk is adequately described by the doping profile, but the threshold equation is shown to be an excellent approximation for non quasi-neutral profiles as well. Comparison with experimental results show the analytical expression to be in good agreement with data over a wide range of implant conditions and starting substrate resistivity.","doi":"10.1109/T-ED.1977.18707","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel5/16/31761/01478899.pdf","startPage":"182","endPage":"192","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/T-ED.1977.18707","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31761","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Ion-implanted threshold tailoring for insulated gate field-effect transistors","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1478899","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1977","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1977","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1478899/","displayDocTitle":"Ion-implanted threshold tailoring for insulated gate field-effect transistors","volume":"24","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 1977","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"09 August 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ion-implanted threshold tailoring for insulated gate field-effect transistors","sourcePdf":"01478899.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.026092S","chronDate":"Mar 1977","isNumber":"31761","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"42","articleId":"1478899","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1977","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1478904,"authors":[{"name":"F.H.

A device design is presented for an enhancement mode FET with a channel length of I \u00b5m that is suitable for operation at liquid nitrogen temperature.","doi":"10.1109/T-ED.1977.18712","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel5/16/31761/01478904.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/T-ED.1977.18712","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31761","startPage":"218","endPage":"229","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Very small MOSFET's for low-temperature operation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1478904","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Very small MOSFET's for low-temperature operation","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1977","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1478904/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1977","isJournal":true,"volume":"24","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 1977","dateOfInsertion":"09 August 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Very small MOSFET's for low-temperature operation","sourcePdf":"01478904.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.056229S","chronDate":"Mar 1977","isNumber":"31761","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"223","articleId":"1478904","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1977","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-10"},{"_id":1478933,"authors":[{"name":"Chih-Tang Sah","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Illinois, Urbana, IL, USA"],"lastName":"Chih-Tang Sah","id":"37320099800"},{"name":"F.A.

Avalanche injection of hot electrons through gate oxide from a special injector diode in each bit is used to charge the floating gates. A second injector structure included in each bit permits discharge of the floating gate by avalanche injection of holes through gate oxide. The overall design of the DIFMOS bit is dictated by the physical considerations required for each of the avalanche injector types.

The results show an emitter lifetime that is much smaller than the base lifetime in the diode having the highest base doping concentration. In this diode, the recombination current from the emitter is 65 percent of the recombination current from the base, demonstrating the significance of the emitter in governing the static current-voltage dependence. The importance of emitter recombination to the transient characteristics is also demonstrated. The paper emphasizes the techniques by which the base and emitter lifetimes are distinguished. It also demonstrates the need for carefully basing the quantitative analysis of the measurements on the underlying diode physics. The method described here applies not only to p-n diodes but also to junction solar cells and transistors.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel5/16/31764/01478992.pdf","startPage":"662","endPage":"671","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","doi":"10.1109/T-ED.1977.18800","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/T-ED.1977.18800","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31764","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1478992","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A method for determining the emitter and base lifetimes in p-n junction diodes","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1478992/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1977","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1977","displayDocTitle":"A method for determining the emitter and base lifetimes in p-n junction diodes","volume":"24","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 1977","dateOfInsertion":"09 August 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A method for determining the emitter and base lifetimes in p-n junction diodes","sourcePdf":"01478992.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.08523S","chronDate":"Jun 1977","isNumber":"31764","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"6","articleId":"1478992","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1977","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1478995,"authors":[{"name":"B.J.

This type of leakage current is not only a function of the Si substrate parameters, but is also area and geometry dependent; and the implications of this upon RAM design, layout, and testing are discussed.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Leakage current","DRAM chips","Circuit testing","Gettering","Resists","Etching","Oxidation","Clocks","Threshold voltage","Boron"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1479303","doi":"10.1109/IEDM.1977.189223","displayPublicationTitle":"1977 International Electron Devices Meeting","pdfPath":"/iel5/9943/31771/01479303.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IEDM.1977.189223","startPage":"254","endPage":"257","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31771","publicationTitle":"1977 International Electron Devices Meeting","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Characterization of reverse-bias leakage currents and their effect on the holding time characteristics of MOS dynamic RAM circuits","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Characterization of reverse-bias leakage currents and their effect on the holding time characteristics of MOS dynamic RAM circuits","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1479303/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1977","conferenceDate":"5-7 Dec. 1977","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"09 August 2005","publicationDate":"1977","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Characterization of reverse-bias leakage currents and their effect on the holding time characteristics of MOS dynamic RAM circuits","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"01479303.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.01748S","chronDate":"1977","isNumber":"31771","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9943","citationCount":"4","articleId":"1479303","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1977","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":1479310,"authors":[{"name":"J.J.

This cell combines the charge-coupled RAM cell with the one-transistor (1-T) or double-level polysilicon (DP) structure, and its operation is identical to that of conventional dynamic RAM cells. A charge-capacity analysis was undertaken which indicates that the Hi-C cell has a charge storage capacity per unit area 50-100 percent greater than that of the regular 1-T or DP cells. It is also expected to have a leakage current lower than that of the 1-T and DP cells. Results of measurements on the first test structures show a 45-80-percent increase in charge capacity and up to 3\u00d7 reduction in leakage current. In addition, the implant doses can be conveniently chosen so that the charge capacity of the Hi-C cell is maximized and independent of the n-type implant dose in the storage region. This is important regarding manufacturability. This new cell structure represents a significant breakthrough in increased charge capacity and decreased leakage current which should very favorably impact dynamic RAM packing density.","doi":"10.1109/T-ED.1978.19028","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel5/16/31772/01479422.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/T-ED.1978.19028","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31772","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","startPage":"33","endPage":"41","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1978","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"The Hi-C RAM cell concept","volume":"25","issue":"1","dateOfInsertion":"09 August 2005","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 1978","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1479422/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1978","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Hi-C RAM cell concept","sourcePdf":"01479422.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034929S","chronDate":"Jan.  1978","isNumber":"31772","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"17","articleId":"1479422","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1978","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1479437,"authors":[{"name":"C.

The resolution of CCD cameras is limited by the aliasing errors associated with spatially discrete sampling on a photosensing area. The photosensing array arranged in a two-dimensional face-centered rectangular lattice scheme, and the spatial offsetting technique among three CCD's avoid undesirable signal carriers accompanied by aliasing errors. A unique signal processing about vertical correlation of an image is put to use, in order to reduce spurious effects of aliasing. These image processing techniques are theoretically treated on a spectrum space. The photosensing array arranged in a face-centered rectangular lattice scheme is successfully implemented with a zigzag-transfer CCD with checker-pattern sensing sites, which relax some of the lithography requirements and improve image qualities. By means of the zigzag-transfer CCD structure and the image processing, the resolution of color camera has been expanded by a factor of 2.5, compared with that of the conventional CCD cameras employing the same number of pixels. According to the theory, the factor may be increased further up to three or four.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A device structure and spatial spectrum for checker-pattern CCD color camera","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","doi":"10.1109/T-ED.1978.19067","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel5/16/31773/01479461.pdf","startPage":"261","endPage":"266","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/T-ED.1978.19067","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31773","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1479461","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1479461/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1978","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1978","displayDocTitle":"A device structure and spatial spectrum for checker-pattern CCD color camera","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"25","issue":"2","dateOfInsertion":"09 August 2005","publicationDate":"Feb. 1978","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A device structure and spatial spectrum for checker-pattern CCD color camera","sourcePdf":"01479461.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.050247S","chronDate":"Feb 1978","isNumber":"31773","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"5","articleId":"1479461","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1978","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":1479472,"authors":[{"name":"Jun'ichi Sone","affiliation":["Central Research Laboratories, Nippon Electric Company Limited, Kawasaki, Kanagawa, Japan"],"lastName":"Jun'ichi Sone","id":"37335513400"},{"name":"Y.

The threshold voltage of a short-channel device as a function of applied voltages follows as a natural result of the derivation.

Planar gallium arsenide technology was employed using selective ion-implanted enhancement mode junction field-effect transistors (E-JFET) having 3-\u00b5m gate lengths. A nine-stage ring oscillator served as a test vehicle to assess the speed-power product for digital applications. A theoretical analysis shows the transistor operates during the switching transient in the saturation regime, notwithstanding steady-state operation in the linear regime. When the transistor is switched off, the transient response is governed by the load resistance and the input capacitance of the subsequent stage. Means of reducing the switching time by increasing the supply voltage, nonlinear load devices, an output buffer stage, and reduction of gate length and width are described. Directly coupled E-JFET logic does not require level shifting, and, therefore, offers advantages over depletion-mode gallium arsenide MESFET logic by reducing the number of circuit elements per gate. Projected gallium arsenide E-JFET LSI logic circuits will surpass silicon-based bipolar logic with respect to both speed and power, and n-channel silicon MOS logic with respect to speed.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel5/16/31777/01479541.pdf","startPage":"628","endPage":"639","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","doi":"10.1109/T-ED.1978.19147","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/T-ED.1978.19147","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31777","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1479541","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Femtojoule high speed planar GaAs E-JFET logic","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1479541/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1978","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1978","displayDocTitle":"Femtojoule high speed planar GaAs E-JFET logic","volume":"25","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 1978","dateOfInsertion":"09 August 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Femtojoule high speed planar GaAs E-JFET logic","sourcePdf":"01479541.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.048833S","chronDate":"Jun 1978","isNumber":"31777","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"61","articleId":"1479541","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1978","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":1479584,"authors":[{"name":"F.B.

This paper discusses both orientation-dependent and concentration-dependent etching of (100) and (110) silicon. Very exact process control steps may be designed into a process by use of (100) anisotropic and concentration-dependent etching. Also, methods of oxide or nitride pin hole detection in (100) silicon are presented. Mask alignments to obtain different etch front termination in both (100) and (110) silicon are shown. Very high packing density structures, less than 1 \u03bcm, are obtained in the (110) technology, and extremely high etching ratios of greater than 650 to 1 are obtained in (110) orientation-dependent etching.

The threshold voltage, breakdown voltage, and weak inversion current for the forward and reverse modes of operation of the VMOST and the junction capacitance are experimentally related to the nonuniform doping profile of the channel. Equations are developed for the VMOST short-channel threshold voltage and storage capacity of the cell.

The minimum linewidth in integrated circuits is determined on the basis of a physical-statistical model for layout of the circuit pattern. First, the minimum spot size, 2.5 nm, of photon, electron, or ion beams, is determined, based on the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, minimum molecule size of resist, or particle scattering. In a second step, the minimum resolvable distance in the pattern is determined. It is based on two independent measurements of the end points of the distance. Also proximity effects are considered. The resultant minimum distance is about 10 nm. In a third step, the statistics of all the required measurements to define a complex circuit pattern is considered in two extreme cases. In the first case, all measurements are assumed independent. In the second case, complete dependence is assumed corresponding to a repetitive circuit pattern. This procedure determines a minimum linewidth of 70 nm and 30 nm, respectively, assuming 10\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">5</sup>\nmeasurements and tolerances of \u00b1100 percent in linewidth and yield of 37 percent.
