Series-connected PA's show much higher load impedance compared to the parallel combined transistors, which allows output matching to be realized in the low quality (Q)-factor region, providing the broadband performance. The fabricated PA using quadruple-stacked 130 nm mHEMTs has a gain of 21.2 dB and saturated output power of 26.4 dBm with power added efficiency (PAE) of 33% at the design frequency of 18 GHz.

complex frequency- dependent impedances (ACF-DIs) and present a generalized T-junction power divider (T-JPD) operating at dual-band with arbitrary power-dividing ratios based on the proposed transformer. By the rigorous analysis of transmission line theory, the closed-form design equations for this generalized transformer are obtained. Using the analytical design method, a kind of generalized T-JPD can be designed to operate at two different frequencies with different power-dividing ratios. Furthermore, numerical examples are simulated and a microstrip T-JPD operating at 1 and 2.4 GHz with different power-dividing ratios (1.5 and 2 dB, respectively) is fabricated. Good agreements between the simulated and measured results can be observed.","doi":"10.1109/LMWC.2009.2034034","publicationTitle":"IEEE Microwave and Wireless Components Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Microwave and Wireless Components Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/7260/5320183/05320185.pdf","startPage":"792","endPage":"794","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LMWC.2009.2034034","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5320183","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Generalized Dual-Frequency Transformer for Two Arbitrary Complex Frequency-Dependent Impedances","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5320185","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 December 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5320185/","displayDocTitle":"A Generalized Dual-Frequency Transformer for Two Arbitrary Complex Frequency-Dependent Impedances","volume":"19","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"10999048","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5320185/","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Generalized Dual-Frequency Transformer for Two Arbitrary Complex Frequency-Dependent Impedances","sourcePdf":"19lmwc12-ywu-2034034.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.057553S","chronDate":"Dec.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"7260","isNumber":"5320183","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7260","citationCount":"76","xplore-issue":"5320183","articleId":"5320185","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5320188,"authors":[{"name":"Ugur Cem Hasar","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Binghamton University, Binghamton, NY, USA","Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Ataturk University, Erzurum, Turkey"],"firstName":"Ugur Cem","lastName":"Hasar","id":"37299358500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1531-1309"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-1764"}],"articleNumber":"5320188","dbTime":"17 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":26,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":488},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society","url":"http://www.mtt.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Microwave theory and techniques","Dielectric measurements","Dielectric materials","Scattering parameters","Permittivity measurement","Measurement errors","Coaxial components","Calibration","Microwave measurements","Reflection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dielectric materials","measurement errors","microwave materials","microwave measurement","permittivity measurement","S-parameters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["microwave measurement","low-loss dielectric materials","scattering parameter measurement","measurement errors","phase uncertainty","complex permittivity measurement"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Calibration","permittivity measurement","scattering parameters measurement"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A New Microwave Method for Electrical Characterization of Low-Loss Materials","doi":"10.1109/LMWC.2009.2033512","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5320183","endPage":"803","publicationTitle":"IEEE Microwave and Wireless Components Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Microwave and Wireless Components Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/7260/5320183/05320188.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LMWC.2009.2033512","startPage":"801","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5320188","abstract":"A microwave method is proposed to effectively determine the complex permittivity of low-loss dielectric materials. The method uses raw scattering parameter measurements of an empty cell and a measurement cell (a waveguide or coaxial-line section) with one sample for its two configurations. There are three advantages of the proposed method. First, it does not necessitate any calibration to carry out the microwave measurements. Second, it eliminates the measurement errors arising from sample thickness and inhomogeneity present in the second sample, which is required by other methods. Third, it uses transmission-only scattering parameters of the sample in the theoretical formulations so that it may decrease the measurement errors happening from the phase uncertainty in reflection scattering parameters. The measurement results of two low-loss dielectric materials confirm the accuracy of the proposed method.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5320188/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 December 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"19","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2009","accessionNumber":"10999032","htmlLink":"/document/5320188/","displayDocTitle":"A New Microwave Method for Electrical Characterization of Low-Loss Materials","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A New Microwave Method for Electrical Characterization of Low-Loss Materials","sourcePdf":"19lmwc12-uhasar-2033512.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.066282S","chronDate":"Dec.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"7260","isNumber":"5320183","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7260","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"5320183","articleId":"5320188","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5320200,"authors":[{"name":"Sheng-Lyang Jang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, National Taiwan University of Science and Technology, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Sheng-Lyang","lastName":"Jang","id":"37290716100"},{"name":"Yuan-Kai Wu","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, National Taiwan University of Science and Technology, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yuan-Kai","lastName":"Wu","id":"37678182200"},{"name":"Cheng-Chen Liu","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, National Taiwan University of Science and Technology, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Cheng-Chen","lastName":"Liu","id":"37406611100"},{"name":"Jhin-Fang Huang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, National Taiwan University of Science and Technology, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Jhin-Fang","lastName":"Huang","id":"37281261900"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1531-1309"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-1764"}],"articleNumber":"5320200","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":59,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1748},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society","url":"http://www.mtt.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Dual band","Voltage-controlled oscillators","Varactors","Switches","Tuning","Capacitors","CMOS technology","Resonant frequency","Phase noise","Inductance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS integrated circuits","MMIC oscillators","voltage-controlled oscillators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS voltage-controlled oscillator","Colpitts voltage-controlled oscillators","dual-resonance LC tank","phase noise","size 0.18 mum","voltage 0.8 V","frequency 4.78 GHz to 5.19 GHz","frequency 12.19 GHz to 12.61 GHz","current 2.72 mA to 3.2 mA","current 2.18 mA to 2.56 mA"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["CMOS","phase noise","series-tuned and parallel- tuned LC resonator","voltage controlled oscillator (VCO)"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Dual-Band CMOS Voltage-Controlled Oscillator Implemented With Dual-Resonance LC Tank","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5320200","doi":"10.1109/LMWC.2009.2033526","startPage":"816","endPage":"818","publicationTitle":"IEEE Microwave and Wireless Components Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Microwave and Wireless Components Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/7260/5320183/05320200.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LMWC.2009.2033526","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5320183","abstract":"A new fully integrated, dual-band CMOS voltage controlled oscillator (VCO) is presented.

This may lead to a significant enlargement in the horizon of women life, since breast cancer is considered to be among the most deadly types. With this purpose, a consortium has been built to develop a mammography PET system in the framework of the Clear-PEM Collaboration. The Clear-PEM scanner is a unique Positron Emission Mammography (PEM) scanner using APD-based detectors. It is capable of measuring Depth-of-Interaction (DoI) with a resolution of 2 mm in LYSO:Ce crystals, enabling a spatial resolution of 1.2 mm. An important part of the PEM scanner is a high-speed DAE (Data Acquisition Electronics) system. DAE has been developed to process and acquire data coming from the 12,288 front-end (FE) photo-detector channels. In this paper, an overview of this scanner (system and board-level electronics, mechanical design, service and image reconstruction software) is presented, focusing on the specification and implementation of the DAE which is responsible for real-time retrieving, analyzing, filtering and formatting the data coming from the front-end. The objective is to identify relevant data and after conditioning, according to pre-defined protocols, send the data to an acquisition PC for image reconstruction. Communication between DAE and PC is carried out using the S-Link (proprietary of CERN) protocol. Experimental results of validation and test of the DAE system are presented.","publicationTitle":"2009 16th IEEE-NPSS Real Time Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 16th IEEE-NPSS Real Time Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5306040/5321385/05321874.pdf","startPage":"196","endPage":"200","doi":"10.1109/RTC.2009.5321874","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RTC.2009.5321874","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5321385","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High-speed Data Acquisition Electronics for a PEM scanner","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5321874/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-15 May 2009","displayDocTitle":"High-speed Data Acquisition Electronics for a PEM scanner","htmlLink":"/document/5321874/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","dateOfInsertion":"10 November 2009","accessionNumber":"10966813","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"10-15 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High-speed Data Acquisition Electronics for a PEM scanner","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"RTSA13.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.087301S","chronDate":"10-15 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5306040","isNumber":"5321385","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5306040","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5321385","articleId":"5321874","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5321977,"authors":[{"name":"Louis Arpin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Universit\u00e9 de Sherbrook, QUE, Canada"],"firstName":"Louis","lastName":"Arpin","id":"37295898500"},{"name":"Melanie Bergeron","affiliation":["Department of Nuclear Medicine and Radiobiology, Universit\u00e9 de Sherbrook, QUE, Canada"],"firstName":"Melanie","lastName":"Bergeron","id":"37398036300"},{"name":"Marc-Andre Tetrault","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Universit\u00e9 de Sherbrook, QUE, Canada"],"firstName":"Marc-Andre","lastName":"Tetrault","id":"37295896000"},{"name":"Roger Lecomte","affiliation":["Department of Nuclear Medicine and Radiobiology, Universit\u00e9 de Sherbrook, QUE, Canada"],"firstName":"Roger","lastName":"Lecomte","id":"37276643100"},{"name":"Rejean Fontaine","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Universit\u00e9 de Sherbrook, QUE, Canada"],"firstName":"Rejean","lastName":"Fontaine","id":"37276636700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4455-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5321977","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":332},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image edge detection","Field programmable gate arrays","Fabrics","Timing","Signal resolution","Radiation detectors","Positron emission tomography","High-resolution imaging","Temperature sensors","Calibration"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analogue-digital conversion","clocks","delay lines","edge detection","embedded systems","field programmable gate arrays","nuclear electronics","oscillators","signal sampling","timing circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["subnanosecond edge detection system","embedded FPGA fabrics","time-digital converter","calibration","field programmable gate array","FPGA-based TDC","embedded PVT invariant digital delay lines","clock oscillator","digital signal oversampling","timing resolution","nuclear radiation detection","PET imaging applications","positron emission tomography","high precision timing measurement","FPGA deserializers"]}],"abstract":"The time to digital converter (TDC) concept is quite useful to obtain crucial timing information for nuclear radiation detection such as PET imaging applications. The high resolution nature of TDC makes them sensitive to processing and to temperature variations. Thus, a calibration procedure must often be performed to improve measurements. Moreover, field programmable gate array (FPGA)-based TDC exacerbates this problem because the transistor topology is fixed in the fabric for low cost purpose. A sub-nanosecond edge detection system able to overcome process, power supply voltage and temperature (PVT) variations was designed and implemented in an FPGA. Unlike other FPGA-based TDCs, this new solution uses embedded PVT invariant digital delay lines and deserializers included in I/O ports along with a stable clock oscillator resulting in low logic usage. The proposed approach consists in oversampling digital signals to enable absolute timestamps down to 75 ps resolution (31.85 ps rms). As a proof of concept, this paper reports timing resolution down to 321.5 ps.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Sub-Nanosecond Edge Detection System using embedded FPGA fabrics","doi":"10.1109/RTC.2009.5321977","startPage":"299","endPage":"303","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RTC.2009.5321977","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5321385","publicationTitle":"2009 16th IEEE-NPSS Real Time Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 16th IEEE-NPSS Real Time Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5306040/5321385/05321977.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5321977","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5321977/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-15 May 2009","displayDocTitle":"A Sub-Nanosecond Edge Detection System using embedded FPGA fabrics","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5321977/","dateOfInsertion":"10 November 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10974694","conferenceDate":"10-15 May 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Sub-Nanosecond Edge Detection System using embedded FPGA fabrics","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"FESPP22.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074937S","chronDate":"10-15 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5306040","isNumber":"5321385","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5306040","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5321385","articleId":"5321977","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5322002,"authors":[{"name":"Jinyuan Wu","affiliation":["Fenni National Accelerator Laboratory, Batavia, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Jinyuan","lastName":"Wu","id":"37279159400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4455-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5322002","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":18,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":731},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Logic","Pulse generation","Linear systems","Calibration","Testing","Delay effects","Propagation delay","Finite impulse response filter","Feedback"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analogue-digital conversion","application specific integrated circuits","calibration","field programmable gate arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["on-chip processing","wave union TDC implementation","FPGA","natural carry cell delay","analog compensation","bin width control","ASIC","after-fact digital calibration approach","temperature drift","carry chain structure nonuniformity","differential nonlinearity pattern","on-chip calibration challenge","RMS resolutions","time-to-digital conversion","time 20 ps","time 10 ps"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Front End Electronics","TDC","FPGA Firmware"]}],"abstract":"The wave union TDC implemented in FPGA utilizes multiple measurement method to reach time resolution beyond the natural carry cell delay in FPGA.

Recently, we have proposed the notion of error tolerance to improve yields for a wide range of high-performance digital applications, including audio, speech, video, graphics, visualization, games, and wireless communication. Error tolerance systematically codifies the fact that chips used in such applications can be acceptable despite having defects that produce erroneous outputs, provided that the errors are guaranteed to be of certain types and have severities within thresholds specified by the application. In this paper, we propose a new testing approach called threshold testing to practically exploit the notion of error tolerance for applications where errors with absolute numerical magnitudes lower than an application-specified threshold are acceptable. We propose a new automatic test pattern generator (ATPG) for threshold testing for single stuck-at faults. This test generator embodies several completely new techniques, including new approaches for directing the search for a test vector, new types of objectives, new types of necessary conditions, and new approaches to identify and exploit these conditions. We demonstrate that threshold testing can enhance yield and that it is practical in terms of test generation effort and test application costs. We also propose threshold fault simulators and ATPG for bridging and transition delay faults. We use these tools to show that the stuck-at-fault model is indeed a suitable model for threshold testing. This opens the way for developing low-cost tools for threshold testing that will provide high threshold coverage for realistic faults and defects and hence help provide higher yields in future nanoscale processes at low costs.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Threshold Testing: Improving Yield for Nanoscale VLSI","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","doi":"10.1109/TCAD.2009.2032375","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/43/5324016/05324024.pdf","startPage":"1883","endPage":"1895","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCAD.2009.2032375","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5324016","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5324024","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5324024/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 November 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2009","displayDocTitle":"Threshold Testing: Improving Yield for Nanoscale VLSI","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"28","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/5324024/","dateOfInsertion":"17 November 2009","publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"10979289","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Threshold Testing: Improving Yield for Nanoscale VLSI","sourcePdf":"tcad-jiang-2032375.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.108657S","chronDate":"Dec.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"43","isNumber":"5324016","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"5324016","articleId":"5324024","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5324029,"authors":[{"name":"Gianluca Palermo","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Elettronica e Informazione, Politecnico di Milano, Milan, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/43/5324016/5324029/5324029-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Gianluca Palermo (M'06) received the M.S. degree in electronic engineering and the Ph.D. degree in computer engineering from Politecnico di Milano, Milano, Italy, in 2002 and 2006, respectively.","Previously, he was a Consultant Engineer with the Low Power Design Group, Advanced System Technology, STMicroelectronics, where he worked on network-on-chip, and also a Research Assistant with the Advanced Learning and Research Institute, University of Lugano, Lugano, Switzerland.

This optimization phase is called \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">design space exploration</i>\n (DSE), and it usually consists of a \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">multiobjective optimization</i>\n problem with multiple constraints. So far, several heuristic techniques have been proposed to address the DSE problem for MPSoC, but they are not efficient enough for managing the application-specific constraints and for identifying the Pareto front. In this paper, an efficient DSE methodology for application-specific MPSoC is proposed. The methodology is efficient in the sense that it is capable of finding a set of good candidate architecture configurations by minimizing the number of simulations to be executed. The methodology combines the design of experiments (DoEs) and response surface modeling (RSM) techniques for managing system-level constraints. First, the DoE phase generates an initial plan of experiments used to create a coarse view of the target design space to be explored by simulations. Then, a set of RSM techniques is used to refine the simulation-based exploration by exploiting the application-specific constraints to identify the maximum number of feasible solutions. To trade off the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed techniques, a set of experimental results for the customization of a symmetric shared-memory on-chip multiprocessor with actual workloads has been reported in this paper.","doi":"10.1109/TCAD.2009.2028681","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCAD.2009.2028681","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/43/5324016/05324029.pdf","startPage":"1816","endPage":"1829","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5324016","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"ReSPIR: A Response Surface-Based Pareto Iterative Refinement for Application-Specific Design Space Exploration","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5324029/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 November 2009","displayDocTitle":"ReSPIR: A Response Surface-Based Pareto Iterative Refinement for Application-Specific Design Space Exploration","volume":"28","issue":"12","dateOfInsertion":"17 November 2009","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"10979291","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5324029/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"ReSPIR: A Response Surface-Based Pareto Iterative Refinement for Application-Specific Design Space Exploration","sourcePdf":"tcad-zaccaria-2028681.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.087812S","chronDate":"Dec.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"43","isNumber":"5324016","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"75","xplore-issue":"5324016","articleId":"5324029","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5324031,"authors":[{"name":"Josef Spjut","affiliation":["School of Computing, University of Utah, Salt Lake, UT, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/43/5324016/5324031/5324031-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Josef Spjut (S'04) received the B.S. degree in computer engineering from the University of California, Riverside, in 2006.

The TRaX architecture consists of a set of thread processors that include commonly used functional units (FUs) for each thread and that share larger FUs through a programmable interconnect. The memory system takes advantage of the application's read-only access to the scene database and write-only access to the frame buffer output to provide efficient data delivery with a relatively simple memory system. One specific motivation behind TRaX is to accelerate single-ray performance instead of relying on ray packets in single-instruction-multiple-data mode to boost throughput, which can fail as packets become incoherent with respect to the objects in the scene database. In this paper, we describe the TRaX architecture and our performance results compared to other architectures used for ray tracing. Simulated results indicate that a multicore version of the TRaX architecture running at a modest speed of 500 MHz provides real-time ray-traced images for scenes of a complexity found in video games. We also measure performance as secondary rays become less coherent and find that TRaX exhibits only minor slowdown in this case while packet-based ray tracers show more significant slowdown.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"TRaX: A Multicore Hardware Architecture for Real-Time Ray Tracing","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","doi":"10.1109/TCAD.2009.2028981","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/43/5324016/05324031.pdf","startPage":"1802","endPage":"1815","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCAD.2009.2028981","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5324016","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5324031","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5324031/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 November 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2009","displayDocTitle":"TRaX: A Multicore Hardware Architecture for Real-Time Ray Tracing","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"28","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/5324031/","dateOfInsertion":"17 November 2009","publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"10979294","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"TRaX: A Multicore Hardware Architecture for Real-Time Ray Tracing","sourcePdf":"tcad-brunvand-2028981.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.108942S","chronDate":"Dec.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"43","isNumber":"5324016","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"5324016","articleId":"5324031","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5324045,"authors":[{"name":"Fabrizio Mulas","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Matematica e Informatica, University of Cagliari, Cagliari, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/43/5324016/5324045/5324045-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Fabrizio Mulas received the B.S. degree in electronic engineering from the University of Cagliari, Cagliari, Italy, where he is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree in computer science.","In 2007\u20132008, he spent six months at the Integrated Systems Laboratory, Ecole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland, as a Guest Researcher about conception and development of software algorithms and policies for dynamic resource management in multiprocessor systems.

In this context, thermal balancing policies based on task migration are a promising approach to redistribute power dissipation and even out temperature gradients. Since stream computing applications require strict quality of service and timing constraints, the real-time performance impact of thermal balancing policies must be carefully evaluated. In this paper, we present the design of a lightweight thermal balancing policy MiGra, which bounds on-chip temperature gradients via task migration. The proposed policy exploits run-time temperature as well as workload information of streaming applications to define suitable run-time thermal migration patterns, which minimize the number of deadline misses. Furthermore, we have experimentally assessed the effectiveness of our thermal balancing policy using a complete field-programmable-gate-array-based emulation of an actual three-core MPSoC streaming platform coupled with a thermal simulator. Our results indicate that MiGra achieves significantly better thermal balancing than state-of-the-art thermal management solutions while keeping the number of migrations bounded.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/43/5324016/05324045.pdf","startPage":"1870","endPage":"1882","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","doi":"10.1109/TCAD.2009.2032372","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCAD.2009.2032372","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5324016","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5324045","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Thermal Balancing Policy for Multiprocessor Stream Computing Platforms","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Temperature","Thermal management","Runtime","Control systems","Multiprocessing systems","Power dissipation","Computer applications","Quality of service","Timing","Emulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed memory systems","field programmable gate arrays","memory architecture","microprocessor chips","system-on-chip","temperature control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiprocessor stream computing platforms","thermal balancing policy","die-temperature control","multiprocessor systems-on-chip","task migration","field-programmable-gate-array-based emulation","thermal management solutions","distributed memory architectures"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Multiprocessor architectures","stream computing","systems-on-chip (MPSoCs)","task migration","thermal balancing"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5324045/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 November 2009","displayDocTitle":"Thermal Balancing Policy for Multiprocessor Stream Computing Platforms","volume":"28","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/5324045/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"10979293","dateOfInsertion":"17 November 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Thermal Balancing Policy for Multiprocessor Stream Computing Platforms","sourcePdf":"tcad-atienza-2032372.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.078655S","chronDate":"Dec.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"43","isNumber":"5324016","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"47","xplore-issue":"5324016","articleId":"5324045","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5324630,"authors":[{"name":"Shuncong Zhong","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Electronics, University of Liverpool, UK"],"firstName":"Shuncong","lastName":"Zhong","id":"37599773100"},{"name":"Hao Shen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Electronics, University of Liverpool, UK"],"firstName":"Hao","lastName":"Shen"},{"name":"Yao-Chun Shen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Electronics, University of Liverpool, UK"],"firstName":"Yao-Chun","lastName":"Shen"},{"name":"J.

Its basic operation and characteristics were experimentally confirmed. The proposed SLM device has a spatial resolution as small as several hundred nanometers, and an ultra-high drive speed of several tens of nanoseconds, and its basic operation is possible without active devices. Unlike, existing SLM devices, this device meets both the size and speed requirements of SLMs for use in displaying holographic three-dimensional (3D) moving pictures. To improve SLM device light modulation functionality, we carried out studies on magnetic films with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy to obtain large MO signals, which enabled us to perform improved light modulation performance. In addition, we obtained an MO signal that was thirty times larger than that possible with in-plane anisotropy. We conclude that this type of MO-SLM device is appropriate for displaying future super-high definition, holographic 3-dimensional moving images.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5324833/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-8 Oct. 2009","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5324833/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"10974509","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"10 November 2009","conferenceDate":"4-8 Oct. 2009","displayDocTitle":"An Ultra-High Definition Spatial Light Modulation Device Driven by Spin-Polarized Electrons","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Ultra-High Definition Spatial Light Modulation Device Driven by Spin-Polarized Electrons","confLoc":"Houston, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"ias23p4.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074029S","chronDate":"4-8 Oct. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5324794","isNumber":"5324795","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5324794","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5324795","articleId":"5324833","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5324836,"authors":[{"name":"Ying-Chun Chuang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Kun Shan University, Tainan County, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Ying-Chun","lastName":"Chuang","id":"37401811100"},{"name":"Yu-Lung Ke","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Kun Shan University, Tainan County, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yu-Lung","lastName":"Ke","id":"37275822700"},{"name":"Shun-Yi Chang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Kun Shan University, Tainan County, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Shun-Yi","lastName":"Chang","id":"37677977800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3476-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3475-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0197-2618"}],"articleNumber":"5324836","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":984},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Batteries","Resonance","Switching converters","RLC circuits","Electromagnetic interference","Switching circuits","Switching frequency","Switching loss","Voltage","Equations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["battery chargers","equivalent circuits","power convertors","switched mode power supplies"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["battery charger","parallel loaded resonant converters","electromagnetic interference","switching frequency","continuous conduction mode","battery equivalent circuit","charger circuit","switched mode converter","voltage 12 V"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Highly-Efficient Battery Chargers with Parallel-Loaded Resonant Converters","doi":"10.1109/IAS.2009.5324836","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5324795","endPage":"10","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Industry Applications Society Annual Meeting","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Industry Applications Society Annual Meeting","pdfPath":"/iel5/5324794/5324795/05324836.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IAS.2009.5324836","startPage":"1","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5324836","abstract":"The well established advantages of resonant converters for battery chargers, including fast response, low switching losses, easy of the control scheme, simplicity of circuit configuration, and low electromagnetic interference (EMI), among others, have led to their increasing attraction. This work develops a highly efficient battery charger with a parallel-loaded resonant converter for battery charging applications to improve the performance of traditional switching-mode charger circuits. The charging voltage can be regulated by varying the switching frequency. The switching frequency of the parallel-loaded resonant battery charger was set at continuous conduction mode (CCM). Circuit operation modes are determined from the conduction profiles. Operating equations and operating theory are also developed. This study utilizes the fundamental wave approximation with a battery equivalent circuit to simplify the charger circuit analyses and presents an efficient, small-sized, and cost-effective switched-mode converter for battery chargers. A prototype charger with parallel-loaded resonant converter designed for a 12V-48Ah battery is built and tested to verify the analytical predictions. The maximum charging efficiency of the proposed battery charger topology is as high as 90.9%.

This paper presents the theory, simulation, and lab results of a new type of fully magnetically levitated bearingless motor. The motors are wound without internally connecting the pole pairs, and force is controlled by varying rotor reference frame d-axis current to each pole pair. This in turn raises or lowers the flux caused by the permanent magnets, creating a flux imbalance on the periphery of the rotor, which in turn creates a net force on the rotor. The conical shape of the motor allows forces to be created in both radial and axial directions, allowing these motors full 5-axis levitation.","doi":"10.1109/IAS.2009.5324866","startPage":"1","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Industry Applications Society Annual Meeting","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Industry Applications Society Annual Meeting","pdfPath":"/iel5/5324794/5324795/05324866.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IAS.2009.5324866","endPage":"9","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5324795","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bearingless Five-Axis Rotor Levitation with Two Pole Pair Separated Conical Motors","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5324866/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-8 Oct. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Bearingless Five-Axis Rotor Levitation with Two Pole Pair Separated Conical Motors","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5324866/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10974514","conferenceDate":"4-8 Oct. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"10 November 2009","publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bearingless Five-Axis Rotor Levitation with Two Pole Pair Separated Conical Motors","confLoc":"Houston, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"ias07p4.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049154S","chronDate":"4-8 Oct. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5324794","isNumber":"5324795","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5324794","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"5324795","articleId":"5324866","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5324870,"authors":[{"name":"Shane Hutchinson","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC, USA"],"firstName":"Shane","lastName":"Hutchinson","id":"37682859500"},{"name":"Mesut Baran","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC, USA"],"firstName":"Mesut","lastName":"Baran","id":"37276292400"},{"name":"Srdjan Lukic","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC, USA"],"firstName":"Srdjan","lastName":"Lukic","id":"37332810700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3476-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3475-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0197-2618"}],"articleNumber":"5324870","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":15,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":552},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power supplies","Electric vehicles","Hybrid electric vehicles","Power generation","Plugs","Cables","AC generators","Battery powered vehicles","DC generators","Hybrid power systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["battery powered vehicles","hybrid electric vehicles","power supplies to apparatus"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electric vehicle charging system","large parking deck","power supply infrastructure","supply cables","supply transformer"]}],"abstract":"This paper explores the main design issues related to power supply infrastructure needed for a vehicle charging system to be implemented in a large parking deck.

A three-leg VSC (Voltage Source Converter) based DSTATCOM with a zig-zag transformer is used for the compensation of reactive power for voltage regulation or for power factor correction along with load balancing, elimination of harmonics currents and neutral current compensation at the point of common coupling (PCC). The Adaline (adaptive linear element) based neural network is used to implement the control scheme of the VSC. This technique gives similar performance as that of other control techniques, but it is simple to implement and has a fast response and gives nearly zero phase shift. The zig-zag transformer is used for providing a path to the zero sequence current in a three-phase four-wire distribution system. This reduces the complexity and also cost of the DSTATCOM system. The performance of the proposed DSTATCOM system is validated through simulations using MATLAB software with its Simulink and Power System Blockset (PSB) toolboxes and hardware implementation.","doi":"10.1109/IAS.2009.5324875","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Industry Applications Society Annual Meeting","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IAS.2009.5324875","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5324795","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Industry Applications Society Annual Meeting","pdfPath":"/iel5/5324794/5324795/05324875.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Implementation of Neural Network Controlled Three-Leg VSC and a Transformer as Three-Phase Four-Wire DSTATCOM","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5324875/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Implementation of Neural Network Controlled Three-Leg VSC and a Transformer as Three-Phase Four-Wire DSTATCOM","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5324875/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10974535","publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"10 November 2009","conferenceDate":"4-8 Oct. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-8 Oct. 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Implementation of Neural Network Controlled Three-Leg VSC and a Transformer as Three-Phase Four-Wire DSTATCOM","confLoc":"Houston, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"ias15p3.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057905S","chronDate":"4-8 Oct. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5324794","isNumber":"5324795","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5324794","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5324795","articleId":"5324875","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":5324903,"authors":[{"name":"Jihui Ye","affiliation":["Samsung Thales Company Limited, Yongin si, Gyeonggi, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jihui","lastName":"Ye","id":"37667305400"},{"name":"Yongjin Kim","affiliation":["Samsung Thales Company Limited, Yongin si, Gyeonggi, South Korea"],"firstName":"Yongjin","lastName":"Kim","id":"37677831000"},{"name":"Boohwan Lee","affiliation":["Agency for Defence Development, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Boohwan","lastName":"Lee","id":"37281114800"},{"name":"Jieun Kim","affiliation":["Agency for Defence Development, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jieun","lastName":"Kim","id":"37678153100"},{"name":"Byungin Choi","affiliation":["Samsung Thales Company Limited, Yongin si, Gyeonggi, South Korea"],"firstName":"Byungin","lastName":"Choi","id":"37675389300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5416-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5417-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2162-2027"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2162-2035"}],"articleNumber":"5324903","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":218},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5324903","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Object detection","Filters","Face detection","Missiles","Detection algorithms","Filtering","Shape","Polynomials","Cameras","Temperature"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["clutter","infrared imaging","military systems","object detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["target detection","IR point target","bivariate cubic facet fitting","clutters"]}],"abstract":"In the target detection algorithm based on the bivariate cubic facet fitting (BCFF), the target position can be selected so that the position has the maximum value or energy value of the filtered result.

Its basic idea is that a secondary user (unlicensed user) can be permitted to use licensed spectrum, provided that it does not interfere with any primary users (licensed users). CR technology enables the development of an intelligent and adaptive wireless communication system that is essentially aware of the radio frequency environment. In this paper, we have proposed a novel cognitive MAC protocol for cognitive radio networks under the property-rights model, in which, secondary users are divided into several non-overlapping groups, and each group uses the proposed auction algorithm to bid for leasing the required channels from the auctioneer appointed by primary users. To the best of our knowledge, this protocol is the first to maximize the utilization of spectrum resources while achieving revenue maximization for primary users. Simulations indicate that our proposed MAC protocol utilizes spectrum resources to the maximum, guarantees the fairness and dynamics of channels allocation among groups.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WiMob.2009.38","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5325194","startPage":"173","endPage":"178","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Wireless and Mobile Computing, Networking and Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5325193/5325194/05325197.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Leasing Oriented MAC Protocol for High Spectrum Usage in Cognitive Radio Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5325197/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Oct. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5325197/","displayDocTitle":"A Leasing Oriented MAC Protocol for High Spectrum Usage in Cognitive Radio Networks","conferenceDate":"12-14 Oct. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"10966712","dateOfInsertion":"10 November 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Leasing Oriented MAC Protocol for High Spectrum Usage in Cognitive Radio Networks","confLoc":"Marrakech, Morocco","sourcePdf":"3841a173.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.08005S","chronDate":"12-14 Oct. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5325193","isNumber":"5325194","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5325193","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"5325194","articleId":"5325197","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5325199,"authors":[{"name":"K.

The two belt-head and belt-chest channels are compared, where, belt, refers to the transmitter's location, while the second part refers to the receiver location. The on-body channel model is constructed by using the Rice factor, the path loss, the shadowing deviation as well as the correlation matrice extracted from an intensive measurement campaign in the 2.45 GHz band. Unlike the conventional wireless models, different pathloss and Ricean factor values are evaluated and assigned for each spatial on-body subchannel in order to characterize the different statistical properties noted in the subchannels. This results in a good agreement with the measured channel. Furthermore, the maximum achievable capacity is investigated with the classic uniform power and the waterfilling schemes. It is shown that at the low SNR range, the waterfilling scheme yields a higher capacity performance, whilst similar performance is achieved with both schemes at high SNR values.","doi":"10.1109/WiMob.2009.89","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Wireless and Mobile Computing, Networking and Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Wireless and Mobile Computing, Networking and Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5325193/5325194/05325199.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WiMob.2009.89","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5325194","startPage":"185","endPage":"190","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Capacity Evaluation of On-body Channels Using MIMO Antennas","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5325199","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Capacity Evaluation of On-body Channels Using MIMO Antennas","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Oct. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5325199/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"12-14 Oct. 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"10966714","dateOfInsertion":"10 November 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5325199/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Capacity Evaluation of On-body Channels Using MIMO Antennas","confLoc":"Marrakech, Morocco","sourcePdf":"3841a185.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060286S","chronDate":"12-14 Oct. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5325193","isNumber":"5325194","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5325193","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5325194","articleId":"5325199","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5325205,"authors":[{"name":"Tsunehiko Chiba","affiliation":["KDD Research and Development Laboratories, Inc., Fujimino, Saitama, Japan"],"firstName":"Tsunehiko","lastName":"Chiba","id":"37410771100"},{"name":"Hidetoshi Yokota","affiliation":["KDD Research and Development Laboratories, Inc., Fujimino, Saitama, Japan"],"firstName":"Hidetoshi","lastName":"Yokota","id":"37271665100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3841-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2160-4886"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2160-4894"}],"articleNumber":"5325205","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":288},"abstract":"Recently, femtocells, which cover a cell area of several tens of meters, have been attracting considerable attention in mobile communications. When a femtocell is connected through a public network, such as a broadband access network or the Internet, a secure tunnel is established between the femtocell and the security gateway located in the mobile core network and media data are sent and received over that tunnel. Therefore, if the security gateway is far away from the femtocells and those femtocells are in close proximity with each other, the routing path of the media data between users becomes redundant. Moreover, the intensive processing due to encryption and decryption for the media data protection could impact on the load of the security gateway. In this paper, we propose efficient media path optimization mechanisms by sending and receiving media data directly between femtocells in coordination with IMS (IP multimedia subsystem), which is expected to be a core technology for session control in an all-IP network, and evaluate the proposed mechanisms using a commercial femtocell.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Wireless and Mobile Computing, Networking and Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5325193/5325194/05325205.pdf","startPage":"221","endPage":"226","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Wireless and Mobile Computing, Networking and Communications","doi":"10.1109/WiMob.2009.45","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WiMob.2009.45","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5325194","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5325205","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient Route Optimization Methods for Femtocell-Based All IP Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optimization methods","IP networks","Femtocells","Mobile communication","Communication system control","Data security","Cryptography","Radio access networks","Joining processes","Protection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["IP networks","mobile communication","multimedia communication","telecommunication network routing","telecommunication security"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["route optimization","femtocell","all-IP network","security gateway","media data protection","media path optimization","IP multimedia subsystem"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Femtocell","Route Optimization","IMS"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5325205/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Oct. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Efficient Route Optimization Methods for Femtocell-Based All IP Networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5325205/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"10966720","dateOfInsertion":"10 November 2009","conferenceDate":"12-14 Oct. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient Route Optimization Methods for Femtocell-Based All IP Networks","confLoc":"Marrakech, Morocco","sourcePdf":"3841a221.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053947S","chronDate":"12-14 Oct. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5325193","isNumber":"5325194","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5325193","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"5325194","articleId":"5325205","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":5325207,"authors":[{"name":"Mi-Ryeong Kim","affiliation":["The Graduate School of Information and Telecommunications, Inha University, Incheon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Mi-Ryeong","lastName":"Kim","id":"37674942100"},{"name":"Sang-Jo Yoo","affiliation":["The Graduate School of Information and Telecommunications, Inha University, Incheon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Sang-Jo","lastName":"Yoo","id":"37403379000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3841-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2160-4886"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2160-4894"}],"articleNumber":"5325207","dbTime":"28 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":21,"citationCountPatent":5,"totalDownloads":477},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Protocols","Radio control","Cognitive radio","Wireless sensor networks","Communication system control","Intelligent sensors","Radio spectrum management","Large scale integration","Intelligent systems","Wireless communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ad hoc networks","cognitive radio","protocols","radiofrequency interference","statistical analysis","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed coordination protocol","multichannel ad-hoc cognitive radio network","wireless service","large-scale sensor network","communication infrastructure","dynamic spectrum access","open spectrum sharing","intelligent wireless communication system","radio environment","statistical variation","radio frequency","open spectrum allocation","network interference","common control channel selection protocol"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cognitive radio","Dynamic spectrum access","Ad-hoc networks","Common control channel"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5325207","doi":"10.1109/WiMob.2009.46","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Wireless and Mobile Computing, Networking and Communications","abstract":"The exponential growth in wireless services has resulted in an overly crowded spectrum. The current state of spectrum allocation indicates that almost all usable frequencies have already been occupied. This makes one pessimistic about the feasibility of integrating emerging wireless services such as large-scale sensor networks into the existing communication infrastructure. Cognitive radio is the emerging dynamic spectrum access technology to achieve open spectrum sharing flexibly and efficiently. It is an intelligent wireless communication system that is aware of its radio environment and is capable of adapting its operation to statistical variations of the radio frequency. Ad-hoc networks in terms of cognitive radio rely on a common control channel (CCC) for operation. Control signals are used to enable cooperation communicate through a common control channel. However, common control channel may not be always available in an open spectrum allocation scheme due to interference and coexistence with primary systems (PS) of the spectrum. In this paper, we propose a novel common control channel selection protocol (DCP-CCC) in a distributed way based on appearance patterns of PS and connectivity among nodes. Using simulation results, we evaluate the performance of the proposed CCC selection scheme.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WiMob.2009.46","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5325194","startPage":"227","endPage":"232","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Wireless and Mobile Computing, Networking and Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5325193/5325194/05325207.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed Coordination Protocol for Common Control Channel Selection in Multichannel Ad-Hoc Cognitive Radio Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5325207/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Oct. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5325207/","displayDocTitle":"Distributed Coordination Protocol for Common Control Channel Selection in Multichannel Ad-Hoc Cognitive Radio Networks","conferenceDate":"12-14 Oct. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"10974566","dateOfInsertion":"10 November 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed Coordination Protocol for Common Control Channel Selection in Multichannel Ad-Hoc Cognitive Radio Networks","confLoc":"Marrakech, Morocco","sourcePdf":"3841a227.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065795S","chronDate":"12-14 Oct. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5325193","isNumber":"5325194","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5325193","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"5325194","articleId":"5325207","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5325228,"authors":[{"name":"A.

To be efficient, most of these techniques require accurate estimation of the destination position. In vehicular environments, standard beamforming is not suitable when continuous tracking of node location is required. To handle inaccuracies in location estimation, this work uses Linearly Constrained Minimum Variance (LCMV) beamforming to form beams in adjoining directions to facilitate tracking. The directions are selected using the last accurate destination direction and movement parameters such as direction and speed variations of the source.

Misbehavior is implemented by refraining from responding to cooperation request, mimicking adverse channel conditions. From time to time (with a given percentage) cooperations requests are accepted in order to avoid being detected as selfish. In this paper, we propose a technique for detecting misbehavior of nodes in an ad hoc network using carrier sense multiple access (CSMA) and automatic repeat request (ARQ) protocol. Each node can detect control packets of ARQ among source, destination and cooperating nodes, and collect statistics on their decoding probability. Selfish behavior is detected based on uniformly most powerful (UMP) test which yields the minimum miss detection probability for a given false alarm probability.","doi":"10.1109/WiMob.2009.19","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Wireless and Mobile Computing, Networking and Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Wireless and Mobile Computing, Networking and Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5325193/5325194/05325314.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WiMob.2009.19","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5325194","startPage":"55","endPage":"60","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Selfish Misbehavior Detection in CSMA Cooperative Networks with HARQ","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5325314","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Selfish Misbehavior Detection in CSMA Cooperative Networks with HARQ","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Oct. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5325314/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"12-14 Oct. 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"10966761","dateOfInsertion":"10 November 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5325314/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Selfish Misbehavior Detection in CSMA Cooperative Networks with HARQ","confLoc":"Marrakech, Morocco","sourcePdf":"3841a055.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059681S","chronDate":"12-14 Oct. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5325193","isNumber":"5325194","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5325193","xplore-issue":"5325194","articleId":"5325314","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5325317,"authors":[{"name":"Imed Hadj-Kacem","affiliation":["Laboratoire LETI, ENIS Engineering School, Sfax, Tunisia","ETIS, UMR 8051, CNRS, ENSEA, University of Cergy-Pontoise, Cergy, France"],"firstName":"Imed","lastName":"Hadj-Kacem","id":"38271285400"},{"name":"Noura Sellami","affiliation":["Laboratoire LETI, ENIS Engineering School, Sfax, Tunisia"],"firstName":"Noura","lastName":"Sellami","id":"37284494700"},{"name":"Inbar Fijalkow","affiliation":["ETIS, UMR 8051, CNRS, ENSEA, University of Cergy-Pontoise, Cergy, France"],"firstName":"Inbar","lastName":"Fijalkow","id":"37269104600"},{"name":"Aline Roumy","affiliation":["INRIA, Rennes, France"],"firstName":"Aline","lastName":"Roumy","id":"37267239400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3841-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2160-4886"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2160-4894"}],"articleNumber":"5325317","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":46},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Fading","Channel estimation","Iterative decoding","Throughput","Transmitting antennas","Receiving antennas","Frequency","Mobile computing","Computer networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","fading channels","maximum likelihood decoding","MIMO communication","radio receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO flat fading channels","decision-directed channel estimation","training sequence interval optimization","iterative receiver","likelihood generator","maximum a posteriori decoder"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we address the problem of optimization of the training sequence interval for MIMO (multiple-input multiple-output) flat fading channels when an iterative receiver composed of a likelihood generator and a maximum a posteriori (MAP) decoder is used.

Implementations of our parallel Mersenne Twister number generator core on Xilinx Virtex4 FPGAs achieve a throughput of 26.13 billion random samples per second. The paper also reports equivalent parallel software implementations running on an Intel Core 2 Quad Q9300 CPU with 8 GB RAM, using multi-threading technology and the Intel\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">reg</sup>\n Math Kernel Library (MKL), as well as on an NVIDIA 8800 GTX GPU. Comparative results show that our FPGA-based implementation outperforms equivalent CPU and GPU implementations by ~25times and ~9times respectively. Moreover, when using the same amount of energy, the FPGA can generate 37times and 35times more Mersenne Twister random samples than the CPU and the GPU, respectively.","publicationTitle":"2009 NASA/ESA Conference on Adaptive Hardware and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 NASA/ESA Conference on Adaptive Hardware and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5325403/5325404/05325420.pdf","startPage":"460","endPage":"464","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Mersenne Twister Random Number Generation on FPGA, CPU and GPU","doi":"10.1109/AHS.2009.11","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5325404","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AHS.2009.11","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5325420","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5325420/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July 29 2009-Aug. 1 2009","displayDocTitle":"Mersenne Twister Random Number Generation on FPGA, CPU and GPU","dateOfInsertion":"10 November 2009","publicationDate":"July 2009","accessionNumber":"10966771","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"29 July-1 Aug. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5325420/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mersenne Twister Random Number Generation on FPGA, CPU and GPU","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"3714a460.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078269S","chronDate":"July 29 2009-Aug. 1 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5325403","isNumber":"5325404","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5325403","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"5325404","articleId":"5325420","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5325421,"authors":[{"name":"Yang Song","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Arizona Tucson, Tucson, AZ, USA"],"firstName":"Yang","lastName":"Song","id":"37579165200"},{"name":"Gregory M.

However it's computational complexity makes SW impractical to use in clinical environment compared to much faster but less accurate sequence alignment technique such as BLAST. High performance computing community is examining alternative multi core architectures such as IBM cell broadband engine (BE) and graphics processing units (GPUs) that address the limitations of modern cache based designs. In this paper we investigate the performance of IBM Cell BE architecture in the context of SW. We present an analysis on architectural features of the Cell BE, study the architecture's fitness for accelerating sequence alignment based on its parallel processing power, interconnect structure and communication protocols among the processing cores. We then evaluate the performance of Cell BE against the state of art implementation of SW on NVIDIA's Tesla GPU. Results show that based on the memory architecture of the SW algorithm, Cell BE performs much better than Tesla GPU in terms of both cycle count and execution time metrics. Compared to purely serial implementation, in terms of cycle count, while state of the art GPU implementation delivers 15x speedup, our solution achieves 64x speedup.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"July 29 2009-Aug. 1 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5325421/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10966772","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5325421/","publicationDate":"July 2009","dateOfInsertion":"10 November 2009","conferenceDate":"29 July-1 Aug. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Performance Analysis of IBM Cell Broadband Engine on Sequence Alignment","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance Analysis of IBM Cell Broadband Engine on Sequence Alignment","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"3714a439.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.108399S","chronDate":"July 29 2009-Aug. 1 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5325403","isNumber":"5325404","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5325403","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5325404","articleId":"5325421","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5325422,"authors":[{"name":"Tsuyoshi Hamada","affiliation":["Nagasaki Advanced Computing Center, Nagasaki University, Nagasaki, Japan"],"firstName":"Tsuyoshi","lastName":"Hamada","id":"37534199600"},{"name":"Khaled Benkrid","affiliation":["School of Engineering, University of Edinburgh, UK"],"firstName":"Khaled","lastName":"Benkrid","id":"37273494800"},{"name":"Keigo Nitadori","affiliation":["RIKEN Institute of Physical and Chemical Research, Yokohama, Kanagawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Keigo","lastName":"Nitadori","id":"37604363200"},{"name":"Makoto Taiji","affiliation":["RIKEN Institute of Physical and Chemical Research, Yokohama, Kanagawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Makoto","lastName":"Taiji","id":"37389268300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3714-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5325422","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":15,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":695},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Application specific integrated circuits","Field programmable gate arrays","Computational modeling","Gravity","Hardware","Context modeling","High performance computing","Costs","Pipelines","NASA"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["application specific integrated circuits","computer graphic equipment","field programmable gate arrays","N-body simulations (astronomical)","parallel processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ASIC","FPGA","GPU","general purpose processor","gravitational force calculation","N-body simulation","astrophysics","speed performance","power efficiency","development cost","many-body simulation","performance per dollar figure","performance per Watt figure","parallel computing"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["N-body simulation","GPGPU","High Performance Computing"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we describe the implementation of gravitational force calculation for N-body simulations in the context of astrophysics.

An effective and simple algorithm for signal probabilities has been used to detect SEU (single event upset) sensitive gates for a given circuit. The circuit can be hardened against radiation effects by applying triple modular redundancy (TMR) technique to only these sensitive gates. Selective TMR is tested against different circuits to prove its efficacy. With a small loss of SEU immunity, the proposed scheme can greatly reduce the area overhead as compare to TMR technique. Selective TMR scheme along with the readback and reconfiguration features of FPGAs can result into a very effective SEU mitigation technique.","doi":"10.1109/AHS.2009.9","publicationTitle":"2009 NASA/ESA Conference on Adaptive Hardware and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 NASA/ESA Conference on Adaptive Hardware and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5325403/5325404/05325433.pdf","startPage":"344","endPage":"350","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AHS.2009.9","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5325404","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Notice of Violation of IEEE Publication Principles: Selective Triple Modular Redundancy for Single Event Upset (SEU) Mitigation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5325433","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"July 29 2009-Aug. 1 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5325433/","displayDocTitle":"Notice of Violation of IEEE Publication Principles: Selective Triple Modular Redundancy for Single Event Upset (SEU) Mitigation","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2009","accessionNumber":"10966778","conferenceDate":"29 July-1 Aug. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"10 November 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Notice of Violation of IEEE Publication Principles: Selective Triple Modular Redundancy for Single Event Upset (SEU) Mitigation","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"3714a344.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040659S","chronDate":"July 29 2009-Aug. 1 2009","isNumber":"5325404","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5325403","citationCount":"22","articleId":"5325433","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5325434,"authors":[{"name":"Pierre-Andr\u00e9 Mudry","affiliation":["Ecole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Pierre-Andr\u00e9","lastName":"Mudry","id":"37550099600"},{"name":"Gianluca Tempesti","affiliation":["Department of Electronics, University of York, York, UK"],"firstName":"Gianluca","lastName":"Tempesti","id":"37264973600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3714-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5325434","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":109},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resource management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","multiprocessing systems","resource allocation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["self-scaling stream processing","resource allocation","bioinspired dynamic task replication algorithm","36-processor system","embedded multiprocessors systems","FPGA"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Multiprocessor systems","Multiple data stream architectures (Multiprocessors)","Load balancing and task assignment","Cellular architecture","Reconfigurable hardware","Adaptable architectures"]}],"abstract":"In this article, we show how the use of a bio-inspired dynamic task replication algorithm, in the context of stream processing, can be used to significantly improve the performance of embedded programs.

The technique also improves signature extraction, object recognition and feature classification capabilities by providing exact reconstructed data on constrained downlink resources. At JPL a novel, adaptive and predictive technique for lossless compression of hyperspectral data was recently developed. This technique uses an adaptive filtering method and achieves a combination of low complexity and compression effectiveness that far exceeds state-of-the-art techniques currently in use. The JPL-developed `Fast Lossless' algorithm requires no training data or other specific information about the nature of the spectral bands for a fixed instrument dynamic range. It is of low computational complexity and thus well-suited for implementation in hardware. It was modified for pushbroom instruments and makes it practical for flight implementations. A prototype of the compressor (and decompressor) of the algorithm is available in software, but this implementation may not meet speed and real-time requirements of some space applications. Hardware acceleration provides performance improvements of 10times-100times vs. the software implementation (about 1M samples/sec on a Pentium IV machine). This paper describes a hardware implementation of the `modified fast lossless' compression algorithm for pushbroom instruments on a field programmable gate array (FPGA). The FPGA implementation targets the current state-of-the-art FPGAs (Xilinx Virtex IV and V families) and compresses one sample every clock cycle to provide a fast and practical real-time solution for space applications.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 NASA/ESA Conference on Adaptive Hardware and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5325403/5325404/05325437.pdf","startPage":"315","endPage":"322","publicationTitle":"2009 NASA/ESA Conference on Adaptive Hardware and Systems","doi":"10.1109/AHS.2009.66","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AHS.2009.66","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5325404","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5325437","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hardware Implementation of Lossless Adaptive and Scalable Hyperspectral Data Compression for Space","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hardware","Hyperspectral imaging","Data compression","Field programmable gate arrays","Instruments","Downlink","NASA","Data mining","Object recognition","Adaptive filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive filters","astronomical image processing","data compression","feature extraction","field programmable gate arrays","image coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["lossless adaptive hyperspectral data compression","lossless scalable hyperspectral data compression","hardware implementation","NASA limited downlink capabilities","DoD limited downlink capabilities","signature extraction","object recognition","feature classification","adaptive filtering method","fast lossless algorithm","pushbroom instruments","flight implementations","field programmable gate array"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["hyperspectral data","lossless compression","FPGA implementation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5325437/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July 29 2009-Aug. 1 2009","displayDocTitle":"Hardware Implementation of Lossless Adaptive and Scalable Hyperspectral Data Compression for Space","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5325437/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2009","accessionNumber":"10966781","dateOfInsertion":"10 November 2009","conferenceDate":"29 July-1 Aug. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hardware Implementation of Lossless Adaptive and Scalable Hyperspectral Data Compression for Space","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"3714a315.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.097463S","chronDate":"July 29 2009-Aug. 1 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5325403","isNumber":"5325404","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5325403","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"5325404","articleId":"5325437","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":5325440,"authors":[{"name":"Tanya Vladimirova","affiliation":["Surrey Space Centre, Department of Electronic Engineering, University of Surrey, Guildford, UK"],"firstName":"Tanya","lastName":"Vladimirova","id":"37300553600"},{"name":"Jean Robert Paul","affiliation":["Surrey Space Centre, Department of Electronic Engineering, University of Surrey, Guildford, UK"],"firstName":"Jean Robert","lastName":"Paul","id":"37396268100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3714-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5325440","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":259},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Transmitters","System-on-a-chip","Earth","Space missions","Monitoring","Artificial satellites","Network topology","Context","Wireless networks","Transceivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["reconfigurable architectures","satellite communication","system-on-chip","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["IEEE 802.11a transmitter module implementation","reconfigurable system-on-a-chip design","flying satellite mission","intersatellite communication","on-board computing system","adaptable processing capability","satellite network topology","wireless network transceiver core"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["IEEE 802.11 transceiver","reconfigurable system-on-a-chip","intersatellite communication","CubeSat"]}],"abstract":"Future formation flying satellite missions are being developed for a number of applications including Earth observation, space weather monitoring, etc. To carry out such missions effectively, intersatellite communication and on-board computing systems with adaptable processing capabilities will be needed.

As an example experiment, we consider the task of uniformly covering an unknown geographical terrain using autonomous MANET nodes with a limited communication range, which has many military missions such as search and rescue missions, surveillance tasks, locating and mapping chemical, and biological hazards. To achieve this objective, mobile nodes exchange one-hop neighbor information to decide their speed and directions without any central coordinator. Each node runs a genetic algorithm (GA) to select fitter speed and direction among an exponentially large number of choices for a better convergence toward a uniform distribution.

A key feature of the array is its high level of fault tolerance, achieved with only minimal amount of hardware overhead. Inspired by similar biological processes, the technique is based on direct-correlated redundancy, where the redundant (stand-by) configuration bits, as extrinsic experience, are shared between blocks and cells of a colony in the artificial system.

Due to the shared wireless channel between tags and the reader during communication, the tag collision arbitration is a significant issue for reducing the communication overhead. This paper presents a novel anti-collision algorithm named New Enhanced Anti-Collision Algorithm (NEAA) using counters and stack to reduce the probability of collision efficiently and to make it possible to identify multiple passive tags in a timeslot. The upper bound of total timeslots for identifying N passive tags is first derived in this paper; suppose the length of a tag ID is n, the upper bound of total timeslots for identifying N (N= 2\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">n</sup>\n) passive tags is derived to be 2\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">n-1</sup>\n - n + 4, when n > 2.

Our objective is to regulate the LPP space in a parametric manner and extract useful discriminant information from the whole feature space rather than a reduced projection subspace of principal component analysis. This results in better locality preserving power and higher recognition accuracy than the original LPP method. Moreover, the proposed regularization method can easily be extended to other manifold learning algorithms and to effectively address the small sample size problem. Experimental results on two widely used face databases demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method.","doi":"10.1109/TSMCB.2009.2032926","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)","pdfPath":"/iel5/3477/5464482/05325612.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSMCB.2009.2032926","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5464482","startPage":"958","endPage":"963","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Regularized Locality Preserving Projections and Its Extensions for Face Recognition","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5325612","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Regularized Locality Preserving Projections and Its Extensions for Face Recognition","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5325612/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 November 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"40","issue":"3","publicationDate":"June 2010","accessionNumber":"11293056","pubMedId":"19906590","dateOfInsertion":"13 May 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5325612/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Regularized Locality Preserving Projections and Its Extensions for Face Recognition","sourcePdf":"tsmcb-tan-2032926-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073537S","chronDate":"June  2010","xplore-pub-id":"3477","isNumber":"5464482","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3477","citationCount":"107","xplore-issue":"5464482","articleId":"5325612","onlineDate":"10 November 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5325623,"authors":[{"name":"Hai Li","affiliation":["Tianjin Key Laboratory of Advanced Signal Processing, Civil Aviation University of China, Tianjin, China","National Key Laboratory of Radar Signal Processing, Xidian University, Xi'an, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/36/5416603/5325623/5325623-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Hai Li was born in Tianjin, China, on August 12, 1976.

This paper presents the design of high-accuracy fixed-width modified Booth multipliers. To reduce the truncation error, we first slightly modify the partial product matrix of Booth multiplication and then derive an effective error compensation function that makes the error distribution be more symmetric to and centralized in the error equal to zero, leading the fixed-width modified Booth multiplier to very small mean and mean-square errors. In addition, a simple compensation circuit mainly composed of the simplified sorting network is also proposed. Compared to the previous circuits, the proposed error compensation circuit can achieve a tiny mean error and a significant reduction in mean-square error (e.g., at least 12.3% reduction for the 16-bit fixed-width multiplier) while maintaining the approximate hardware overhead. Furthermore, experimental results on two real-life applications also demonstrate that the proposed fixed-width multipliers can improve the average peak signal-to-noise ratio of output images by at least 2.0 dB and 1.1 dB, respectively.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5325646/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 November 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2011","volume":"19","issue":"1","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11704475","dateOfInsertion":"23 December 2010","publicationDate":"Jan. 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5325646/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"High-Accuracy Fixed-Width Modified Booth Multipliers for Lossy Applications","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High-Accuracy Fixed-Width Modified Booth Multipliers for Lossy Applications","sourcePdf":"tvlsi-kuang-2032289-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.122937S","chronDate":"Jan.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"5673483","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"78","xplore-issue":"5673483","articleId":"5325646","onlineDate":"10 November 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5325648,"authors":[{"name":"Jun-Hong Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan County, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/92/5518454/5325648/5325648-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jun-Hong Chen received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electronic engineering from National Yunlin University of Science and Technology, Taiwan, in 2001 and 2003, respectively.

The use of appropriate fault detection schemes for the AES makes it robust to internal defects and fault attacks. In this paper, we present a lightweight concurrent fault detection scheme for the AES. In the proposed approach, the composite field S-box and inverse S-box are divided into blocks and the predicted parities of these blocks are obtained. Through exhaustive searches among all available composite fields, we have found the optimum solutions for the least overhead parity-based fault detection structures. Moreover, through our error injection simulations for one S-box (respectively inverse S-box), we show that the total error coverage of almost 100% for 16 S-boxes (respectively inverse S-boxes) can be achieved. Finally, it is shown that both the application-specific integrated circuit and field-programmable gate-array implementations of the fault detection structures using the obtained optimum composite fields, have better hardware and time complexities compared to their counterparts.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 November 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5325652/","volume":"19","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/5325652/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11704468","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"23 December 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A Lightweight High-Performance Fault Detection Scheme for the Advanced Encryption Standard Using Composite Fields","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Lightweight High-Performance Fault Detection Scheme for the Advanced Encryption Standard Using Composite Fields","sourcePdf":"tvlsi-mozaffarikermani-2031651-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.123018S","chronDate":"Jan.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"5673483","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"51","xplore-issue":"5673483","articleId":"5325652","onlineDate":"10 November 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5325660,"authors":[{"name":"Bong Seok Park","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Yonsei University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Bong Seok","lastName":"Park","id":"37577719600"},{"name":"Sung Jin Yoo","affiliation":["Engineering Research Institute, Yonsei University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Sung Jin","lastName":"Yoo","id":"37290947000"},{"name":"Jin Bae Park","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Yonsei University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jin Bae","lastName":"Park","id":"37281003900"},{"name":"Yoon Ho Choi","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Kyonggi University, Gyeonggi, South Korea"],"firstName":"Yoon Ho","lastName":"Choi","id":"37277377400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6536"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0865"},{"format":"CD","value":"2374-0159"}],"articleNumber":"5325660","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":160,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2468},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Control Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieeecss.org/"}],"abstract":"Almost all existing controllers for nonholonomic mobile robots are designed without considering the actuator dynamics. This is because the presence of the actuator dynamics increases the complexity of the system dynamics, and makes difficult the design of the controller. In this paper, we propose a simple adaptive control approach for path tracking of uncertain nonholonomic mobile robots incorporating actuator dynamics. All parameters of robot kinematics, robot dynamics, and actuator dynamics are assumed to be uncertain. For the simple controller design, the dynamic surface control methodology is applied and extended to mobile robots that the number of inputs and outputs is different. We also adopt the adaptive control technique to treat all uncertainties and derive adaptation laws from the Lyapunov stability theory. Finally, simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed controller.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Adaptive control","Trajectory","Mobile robots","Actuators","Uncertainty","Backstepping","Robot kinematics","Control systems","Surface treatment","Robot control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive control","Lyapunov methods","mobile robots","path planning","position control","robot dynamics","robot kinematics","uncertain systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive control","trajectory tracking","electrically driven uncertain nonholonomic mobile robots","actuator dynamics","system dynamics","controller design","path tracking","robot kinematics","robot dynamics","dynamic surface control methodology","Lyapunov stability theory"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Actuator dynamics","adaptive control","dynamic surface design","nonholonomic mobile robots","robot dynamics","robot kinematics"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5325660","doi":"10.1109/TCST.2009.2034639","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/87/5556461/05325660.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCST.2009.2034639","startPage":"1199","endPage":"1206","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5556461","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Simple Adaptive Control Approach for Trajectory Tracking of Electrically Driven Nonholonomic Mobile Robots","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Simple Adaptive Control Approach for Trajectory Tracking of Electrically Driven Nonholonomic Mobile Robots","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5325660/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 November 2009","volume":"18","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/5325660/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"23 August 2010","publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11477367","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Simple Adaptive Control Approach for Trajectory Tracking of Electrically Driven Nonholonomic Mobile Robots","sourcePdf":"tcst-park-2034639-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.104S","chronDate":"Sept.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"87","isNumber":"5556461","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"87","citationCount":"160","xplore-issue":"5556461","articleId":"5325660","onlineDate":"10 November 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5325662,"authors":[{"name":"Yiran Chen","affiliation":["Seagate Technologies, Inc., Bloomington, MN, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/92/5634429/5325662/5325662-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yiran Chen (M'05) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electrical engineering from Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical and computer engineering from Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, in 2005.","He was with Synopsys Inc., Sunnyvale, CA, where he developed the award-winning statistical static timing analysis EDA tool \u201cPrimeTimeVX\u201d.

A dynamic design flow is also proposed to minimize any unnecessary design margin in an STT-RAM cell design by leveraging from the new STT-RAM cell model. The design of an STT-RAM cell with a one-transistor-one-MTJ (1T1J) structure shows that our technique can reduce more than 22% of the STT-RAM cell area, compared with a conventional STT-RAM cell model at a TSMC 90-nm technology node.

Under a scaled supply voltage and/or variations in process parameters, any possible delay errors appear only from the long paths that are designed to be less contributive to output quality. The proposed architecture allows a graceful degradation in the peak SNR (PSNR) under aggressive voltage scaling as well as extreme process variations. Results show that even under large process variations (\u00b13\u03c3 around mean threshold voltage) and aggressive supply voltage scaling (at 0.88 V, while the nominal voltage is 1.2 V for a 90-nm technology), there is a gradual degradation of image quality with considerable power savings (71% at PSNR of 23.4 dB) for the proposed architecture, when compared to existing implementations in a 90-nm process technology.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 November 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5325663/","volume":"18","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/5325663/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11535023","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"23 September 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Process-Variation Resilient and Voltage-Scalable DCT Architecture for Robust Low-Power Computing","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Process-Variation Resilient and Voltage-Scalable DCT Architecture for Robust Low-Power Computing","sourcePdf":"tvlsi-banerjee-2025279-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.075066S","chronDate":"Oct.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"5584916","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"5584916","articleId":"5325663","onlineDate":"10 November 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5325669,"authors":[{"name":"Shih-En Shih","affiliation":["Northrop Grumman AeroSpace Systems, Redondo Beach, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/5340253/5325669/5325669-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Shih-En Shih (M'99) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electrical engineering from National Tsing-Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan, in 1986 and 1988, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, in 1998.","He is a Senior Staff Engineer with Northrop Grumman's RF Product Center, Redondo Beach, CA.

All three LNAs are capable of better than 13:1 bandwidth. The first low frequency amplifier uses a microstrip design and achieves 17.7 dB flat gain between 300 MHz-3 GHz, and 1.2 dB minimum noise figure around 1.3 GHz. The second 0.3-4 GHz LNA uses coplanar waveguide transmission lines and demonstrates 18 dB flat gain and 1.5 dB noise figure between 2 and 5 GHz. The high frequency microstrip-type LNA shows an average of 13 dB gain and between 2-3 dB noise figure across the band. The robust LNAs can be operated under various bias voltages while similar gain and noise figure performance are maintained.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Ultra wideband technology","Gallium nitride","HEMTs","Low-noise amplifiers","Noise figure","Frequency","Gain","Bandwidth","Microstrip","Aluminum gallium nitride"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["aluminium compounds","gallium compounds","high electron mobility transistors","low noise amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ultra wideband dual-gate HEMT low-noise amplifiers","LNA","frequency 0.3 GHz to 4 GHz","frequency 1.2 GHz to 18 GHz","gain 17.7 dB","noise figure 1.2 dB","noise figure 1.5 dB","noise figure 2 dB to 3 dB","gain 18 dB","gain 13 dB","GaN","AlGaN-GaN"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Broadband amplifier","dual-gate","GaN","high electron mobility transistor (HEMT)","low-noise amplifier (LNA)"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TMTT.2009.2034416","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel5/22/5340253/05325669.pdf","startPage":"3270","endPage":"3277","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5340253","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.2009.2034416","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design and Analysis of Ultra Wideband GaN Dual-Gate HEMT Low-Noise Amplifiers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5325669","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Design and Analysis of Ultra Wideband GaN Dual-Gate HEMT Low-Noise Amplifiers","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5325669/","volume":"57","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5325669/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"11007333","dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 November 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design and Analysis of Ultra Wideband GaN Dual-Gate HEMT Low-Noise Amplifiers","sourcePdf":"57tmtt12-sshih-part2-2034416.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.06715S","chronDate":"Dec.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"5340253","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"32","xplore-issue":"5340253","articleId":"5325669","onlineDate":"10 November 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5325677,"authors":[{"name":"Morteza Abbasi","affiliation":["Microwave Electronics Laboratory, Chalmers University of Technology, Goteborg, Sweden"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/5340253/5325677/5325677-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Morteza Abbasi (S'07) received the M.

The chips are fabricated in a 0.1 \u00bfm GaAs metamorphic high electron-mobility transistor process. The D-band frequency doubler chain covers 110 to 130 GHz with peak output power of 5 dBm. The chip requires 2 dBm input power and consumes only 65 mW of dc power. The signal at the fundamental frequency is suppressed more than 25 dB compared to the desired output signal over the band of interest. The G-band frequency sextupler (\u00d76) chain covers 155 to 195 GHz with 0 dBm peak output power and requires 6.5 dBm input power and 92.5 mW dc power. The input signal to the multiplier chain can be reduced to 4 dBm while the output power drops only by 0.5 dB. The unwanted harmonics are suppressed more than 30 dB compared to the desired signal. An additional 183 GHz power amplifier is presented to be used after the \u00d76 frequency multiplier chain if higher output power is required. The amplifier delivers 5 dBm output power with a small-signal gain of 9 dB from 155 to 195 GHz. The impedance matching networks are realized using coupled transmission lines which is shown to be a scalable and straightforward structure to use in amplifier design.

One with cascode device was designed at V -band in 65-nm process, and the other with triple-cascode structure was fabricated at Q -band in 0.13-\u00bf m technology. To minimize the noise figure and maximize the small-signal gain, inductors are designed and placed between transistors of the cascode and triple-cascode configurations. Based on this approach, the Q-band LNA has a gain of 14.3 dB and a noise figure of 3.8 dB at 38 GHz, with a power consumption of 28.8 mW. The V-band LNA presents a gain of 14.4 dB and a noise figure of 4.5 dB at 54.5 GHz, with a power consumption of 10 mW.

In systems where the complexity is dominated by arithmetic operations, the number of nonzero coefficients in the impulse response may be a more appropriate metric to consider instead, and computational savings are realized by omitting arithmetic operations associated with zero-valued coefficients. This metric is particularly relevant to the design of sensor arrays, where a set of array weights with many zero-valued entries allows for the elimination of physical array elements, resulting in a reduction of data acquisition and communication costs. However, designing a filter with the fewest number of nonzero coefficients subject to a set of frequency-domain constraints is a computationally difficult optimization problem. This paper describes several approximate polynomial-time algorithms that use linear programming to design filters having a small number of nonzero coefficients, i.e., filters that are sparse. Specifically, we present two approaches that have different computational complexities in terms of the number of required linear programs. The first technique iteratively thins the impulse response of a non-sparse filter until frequency-domain constraints are violated. The second minimizes the 1-norm of the impulse response of the filter, using the resulting design to determine the coefficients that are constrained to zero in a subsequent re-optimization stage. The algorithms are evaluated within the contexts of array design and acoustic equalization.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5325686/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 November 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2010","volume":"58","issue":"3","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11105850","dateOfInsertion":"08 February 2010","publicationDate":"March 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5325686/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Linear Programming Algorithms for Sparse Filter Design","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Linear Programming Algorithms for Sparse Filter Design","sourcePdf":"58tsp03-dwei-2036471.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.110895S","chronDate":"March  2010","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"5410625","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"95","xplore-issue":"5410625","articleId":"5325686","onlineDate":"10 November 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5325687,"authors":[{"name":"Keyvan Zarifi","affiliation":["Concordia University, Montreal, QUE, Canada","Institut National de la Recherche Scientifique \u00c9nergie, Mat\u00e9riaux, et T\u00e9l\u00e9communications (INRS EMT), Universit\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec, Montreal, QUE, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/5410625/5325687/5325687-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Keyvan Zarifi (S'04\u2013M'08) received the Ph.D. degree (with the highest honors) in electrical and computer engineering from Darmstadt University of Technology, Darmstadt, Germany, in 2007.","From January 2002 until March 2005, he was with the Department of Communication Systems, University of Duisburg-Essen, Duisburg, Germany.

The existing null-steering beamformers may not be directly applied in wireless sensor networks (WSNs) as they do not conform with the decentralized nature of WSNs and require every node to be aware of the locations of all other nodes in the network. This manuscript presents a novel collaborative null-steering beamformer that can be implemented in uniformly distributed WSNs in which each node is oblivious of other nodes' locations. The average beampattern expression of the proposed beamformer is derived and it is shown that the beampattern associated with any arbitrary realization of the nodes' locations converges with probability one to the so-obtained average beampattern as the number of collaborating nodes grows large. Properties of the average beampattern are analytically studied. In particular, it is proven that the average gain of the proposed beamformer is inversely proportional to the number of collaborating nodes in the directions of unintended receivers and further, if a mild condition is satisfied, it is approximately equal to that of the collaborative conventional beamformer in the directions with far angular distance from any unintended receiver. It is argued that if virtual unintended receivers are assumed at proper directions, then the proposed collaborative null-steering beamformer can form an average beampattern with sidelobe peaks substantially smaller than those of the average beampattern of the collaborative conventional beamformer. To substantiate this argument, the optimal direction of a virtual unintended receiver is obtained such that its associated collaborative null-steering beamformer forms an average beam-pattern with minimal largest side-lobe peak. Depending on the number of collaborating nodes, it is further shown that the largest average sidelobe peak of the latter beamformer is up to 6.6 (dB) less than that of the collaborative conventional beamformer.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2009.2036476","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5410625","startPage":"1889","endPage":"1903","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/5410625/05325687.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Collaborative Null-Steering Beamforming for Uniformly Distributed Wireless Sensor Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5325687/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 November 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5325687/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Collaborative Null-Steering Beamforming for Uniformly Distributed Wireless Sensor Networks","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2010","accessionNumber":"11105834","dateOfInsertion":"08 February 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"58","issue":"3","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Collaborative Null-Steering Beamforming for Uniformly Distributed Wireless Sensor Networks","sourcePdf":"58tsp03-kzarifi-2036476.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.102244S","chronDate":"March  2010","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"5410625","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"59","xplore-issue":"5410625","articleId":"5325687","onlineDate":"10 November 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5325691,"authors":[{"name":"J.

This interpolator makes it possible to approximate the signal and its derivatives with minimal complexity in a range that surrounds the initial instant, and is applicable to uniform and nonuniform sampling grids. The barycentric form of the interpolator is derived using two different procedures, first by the repeated use of Bernstein's inequality and Taylor's theorem, and second by truncating a Lagrange-type series. These procedures show that the proposed method can be applied to existing fixed instant interpolators, and that it can be accurate in long time intervals.

Polarimetric design of the transmit waveforms based on the properties of the target scattering matrix provides better performance than transmitting waveforms with only fixed horizontal or vertical polarizations. We propose a radar system that combines the advantages of both systems by transmitting polarized waveforms from multiple distributed antennas, in order to detect a point-like stationary target. The proposed system employs 2-D vector sensors at the receivers, each of which measures the horizontal and vertical components of the received electric field separately. We design the Neyman-Pearson detector for such systems. We derive approximate expressions for the probability of false alarm (P\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">FA</sub>\n) and the probability of detection (P\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">D</sub>\n). Using numerical simulations, we demonstrate that optimal design of the antenna polarizations provides improved performance over MIMO systems that transmit waveforms of fixed polarizations over all the antennas. We also demonstrate that having multiple widely separated antennas gives improved performance over single-input-single-output (SISO) polarimetric radar. We also demonstrate that processing the vector measurements at each receiver separately gives improved performance over systems that linearly combine both the received signals to give scalar measurements.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/5410625/05325692.pdf","startPage":"1689","endPage":"1697","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2009.2036472","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2009.2036472","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5410625","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5325692","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Polarimetric MIMO Radar With Distributed Antennas for Target Detection","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radar antennas","MIMO","Radar polarimetry","Object detection","Polarization","Transmitting antennas","Antenna measurements","Diversity methods","Radar scattering","Radar detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antennas","diversity reception","MIMO radar","numerical analysis","object detection","radar detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["polarimetric MIMO radar","target detection","multiple-input-multiple-output radar systems","polarimetric design","spatial diversity gain","multiple distributed antennas","2-D vector sensors","Neyman-Pearson detector","false alarm","detection probability","numerical simulations","antenna polarizations","single-input-single-output polarimetric radar"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Distributed","multiple-input\u2013multiple-output (MIMO)","polarimetric","radar"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5325692/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 November 2009","displayDocTitle":"Polarimetric MIMO Radar With Distributed Antennas for Target Detection","volume":"58","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/5325692/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2010","accessionNumber":"11105828","dateOfInsertion":"08 February 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Polarimetric MIMO Radar With Distributed Antennas for Target Detection","sourcePdf":"58tsp03-anehorai-2036472.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.083465S","chronDate":"March  2010","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"5410625","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"70","xplore-issue":"5410625","articleId":"5325692","onlineDate":"10 November 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5325694,"authors":[{"name":"Ron Rubinstein","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Technion-Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, Israel"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/5410625/5325694/5325694-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ron Rubinstein (S'08) received the B.Sc. degree in computer science from the Hebrew University, Jerusalem, Israel, in 2002.

The design is based on the maximization of the channel cut-off rate, which provides an upper bound on the codeword error probability over the ensemble of random codes. The advantage of this optimization criterion is that it allows to get a low PER while keeping the design independent of the specific channel code used in the system. The algorithm is derived for a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) system, and adopts a Bayesian approach to design an algorithm robust to CSI errors. The proposed algorithm converges to the open-loop transmission scheme for the case of no channel knowledge and it converges to the closed-loop design with perfect CSI for the case of no uncertainty. Simulation results evidence the performance gain in terms of PER and throughput of the proposed algorithm when compared to more commonly used optimization criteria.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2009.2036479","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/5410625/05325696.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2009.2036479","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5410625","startPage":"1741","endPage":"1755","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Linear Precoder Design Through Cut-Off Rate Maximization in MIMO-OFDM Coded Systems With Imperfect CSIT","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5325696","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Linear Precoder Design Through Cut-Off Rate Maximization in MIMO-OFDM Coded Systems With Imperfect CSIT","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5325696/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 November 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"58","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 2010","accessionNumber":"11105847","dateOfInsertion":"08 February 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5325696/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Linear Precoder Design Through Cut-Off Rate Maximization in MIMO-OFDM Coded Systems With Imperfect CSIT","sourcePdf":"58tsp03-frey-2036479.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.181814S","chronDate":"March  2010","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"5410625","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"5410625","articleId":"5325696","onlineDate":"10 November 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5325699,"authors":[{"name":"Jun Won Choi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, IL, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/5410625/5325699/5325699-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jun Won Choi received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electrical and computer engineering from the Seoul National University (SNU), Seoul, Korea, in 2000 and 2002, respectively.

RD-MLS is based on a partitioned search which approximates the maximum-likelihood (ML) estimate of symbols by searching a partitioned symbol vector space rather than that spanned by the whole symbol vector. The inevitable performance loss due to a reduction in the search space is compensated by 1) the use of a list tree search, which is an extension of a single best searching algorithm called sphere decoding, and 2) the recomputation of a set of weak symbols, i.e., those ignored in the reduced dimension search, for each strong symbol candidate found during the list tree search. Through simulations on M-quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) transmission in frequency nonselective multi-input-multioutput (MIMO) channels, we demonstrate that the RD-MLS algorithm shows near constant complexity over a wide range of bit error rate (BER) (10\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">-1</sup>\n ~ 10\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">-4</sup>\n), while limiting performance loss to within 1 dB from ML detection.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2009.2036482","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/5410625/05325699.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2009.2036482","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5410625","startPage":"1780","endPage":"1793","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low-Complexity Decoding via Reduced Dimension Maximum-Likelihood Search","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5325699","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Low-Complexity Decoding via Reduced Dimension Maximum-Likelihood Search","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5325699/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 November 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"58","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 2010","accessionNumber":"11105824","dateOfInsertion":"08 February 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5325699/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low-Complexity Decoding via Reduced Dimension Maximum-Likelihood Search","sourcePdf":"58tsp03-bshim-2036482.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.126491S","chronDate":"March  2010","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"5410625","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"33","xplore-issue":"5410625","articleId":"5325699","onlineDate":"10 November 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5325701,"authors":[{"name":"Soummya Kar","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/5410627/5325701/5325701-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Soummya Kar (S'02) received the B.Tech. degree from the Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur, in May 2005.","He joined the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, in fall 2005, where he is currently a Ph.D. student.

To achieve consensus, dither (small noise) is added to the sensor states before quantization. When the quantizer range is unbounded (countable number of quantizer levels), stochastic approximation shows that consensus is asymptotically achieved with probability one and in mean square to a finite random variable. We show that the mean-squared error (mse) can be made arbitrarily small by tuning the link weight sequence, at a cost of the convergence rate of the algorithm. To study dithered consensus with random links when the range of the quantizer is bounded, we establish uniform boundedness of the sample paths of the unbounded quantizer. This requires characterization of the statistical properties of the supremum taken over the sample paths of the state of the quantizer. This is accomplished by splitting the state vector of the quantizer in two components: one along the consensus subspace and the other along the subspace orthogonal to the consensus subspace. The proofs use maximal inequalities for submartingale and supermartingale sequences. From these, we derive probability bounds on the excursions of the two subsequences, from which probability bounds on the excursions of the quantizer state vector follow. The paper shows how to use these probability bounds to design the quantizer parameters and to explore tradeoffs among the number of quantizer levels, the size of the quantization steps, the desired probability of saturation, and the desired level of accuracy \u00bf away from consensus. Finally, the paper illustrates the quantizer design with a numerical study.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed Consensus Algorithms in Sensor Networks: Quantized Data and Random Link Failures","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2009.2036046","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/5410627/05325701.pdf","startPage":"1383","endPage":"1400","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2009.2036046","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5410627","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5325701","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5325701/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 November 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2010","displayDocTitle":"Distributed Consensus Algorithms in Sensor Networks: Quantized Data and Random Link Failures","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"58","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/5325701/","dateOfInsertion":"08 February 2010","publicationDate":"March 2010","accessionNumber":"11136157","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed Consensus Algorithms in Sensor Networks: Quantized Data and Random Link Failures","sourcePdf":"58tsp03-jmoura-2036046.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.116881S","chronDate":"March  2010","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"5410627","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"298","xplore-issue":"5410627","articleId":"5325701","onlineDate":"10 November 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5325707,"authors":[{"name":"Tsung-Yang Liow","affiliation":["Institute of Microelectronics, Agency for Science, Technology and Research, Singapore, Singapore"],"bio":{"p":["Tsung-Yang Liow (S\u201906\u2013M\u201908) received the B.Eng. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical and computer engineering from the National University of Singapore (NUS), Singapore, in 2003 and 2008, respectively.","At NUS, he worked on the design and fabrication of sub-10 nm multiple-gate fully depleted silicon-on-insulator and nanowire transistors, as well as performance enhancement techniques such as channel strain engineering.

A robotic sensor network is deployed in an environment of interest, and takes successive point measurements of a dynamic physical process modeled as a spatio-temporal random field. Taking a Bayesian perspective on the Kriging interpolation technique from geostatistics, we design the distributed Kriged Kalman filter for predictive inference of the random field and of its gradient. The proposed algorithm makes use of a novel distributed strategy to compute weighted least squares estimates when measurements are spatially correlated. This strategy results from the combination of the Jacobi overrelaxation method with dynamic average consensus algorithms. As an application of the proposed algorithm, we design a gradient ascent cooperative strategy and analyze its convergence properties in the absence of measurement errors via stochastic Lyapunov functions. We illustrate our results in simulation.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/9/5340373/05325717.pdf","startPage":"2816","endPage":"2827","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","doi":"10.1109/TAC.2009.2034192","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAC.2009.2034192","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5340373","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5325717","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed Kriged Kalman Filter for Spatial Estimation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robot sensing systems","Inference algorithms","Algorithm design and analysis","Bayesian methods","Interpolation","Distributed computing","Least squares approximation","Jacobian matrices","Heuristic algorithms","Convergence"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["belief networks","inference mechanisms","interpolation","Kalman filters","robots","sensors","statistical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed Kriged Kalman filter","spatial estimation","robotic sensor networks","spatially-distributed estimation tasks","spatio-temporal random field","Kriging interpolation technique","geostatistics","predictive inference","weighted least squares estimation","Jacobi overrelaxation method","dynamic average consensus algorithm","measurement errors","stochastic Lyapunov functions"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cooperative control","distributed estimation","distributed Kriged Kalman filter","robotic sensor networks","spatial statistics"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5325717/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 November 2009","displayDocTitle":"Distributed Kriged Kalman Filter for Spatial Estimation","volume":"54","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/5325717/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"11007398","dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed Kriged Kalman Filter for Spatial Estimation","sourcePdf":"54tac12-jcortes-2034192.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.091913S","chronDate":"Dec.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"9","isNumber":"5340373","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9","citationCount":"176","xplore-issue":"5340373","articleId":"5325717","onlineDate":"10 November 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":5325733,"authors":[{"name":"Jongyoon Jung","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/92/5695105/5325733/5325733-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jongyoon Jung (S'07) received the B.S. and the M.S. degrees in electrical engineering from Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea, in 2005 and 2008, respectively, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree.","His research focuses on process variation aware high-level synthesis.

However, the rapid increase of the impact of the process variation on circuit timing makes the problem much more complicated and unpredictable to tackle in synthesis. This paper addresses a new problem of high-level synthesis (HLS) that effectively takes into account the timing variation. Conventional HLS may simply avoid the timing variation problem by considering the worst case or constant delay model of hardware resources, which are certainly not viable solutions. To overcome the impact of timing variation in HLS, this paper addresses the following two problems: 1) how can the statistical static timing analysis (SSTA) used in logic synthesis be modified and effectively applied to the delay and yield computation in HLS? and 2) how can scheduling and resource binding tasks effectively solve the HLS problem with the objective of minimizing latency under yield constraint? Through an extensive experimentation, we confirm that the proposed variation-aware HLS algorithm is able to reduce the latency by 19.7% under 90% performance yield constraint, compared with the result by conventional timing variation-unaware HLS .","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5325733/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 November 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2011","publicationDate":"Feb. 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5325733/","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2011","accessionNumber":"11762136","volume":"19","issue":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Scheduling and Resource Binding Algorithm Considering Timing Variation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Scheduling and Resource Binding Algorithm Considering Timing Variation","sourcePdf":"tvlsi-tkim-2031676-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.076648S","chronDate":"Feb.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"5695105","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5695105","articleId":"5325733","onlineDate":"10 November 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":5325745,"authors":[{"name":"Mylene Pischella","affiliation":["Institut Sup\u00e9rieur d\u00e9Electronique de Paris, Paris, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/5415848/5325745/5325745-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Mylene Pischella (M'09) received the Engineer Diploma in telecommunications and the Ph.D. degree from Ecole Nationale Sup\u00e9rieure des T\u00e9l\u00e9communications, Paris, France, in 2002 and 2009.","From 2002 to 2009, she was a Research Engineer with France Telecom R&D.

Two suboptimal algorithms with polynomial-time complexity are provided. First, we determine a graph-based subcarrier allocation algorithm allowing joint transmission of two interfering links whenever such a transmission fulfills the pairwise WSTM objective. An analytical expression of the optimal power allocation with two interfering cells in single-carrier transmission is obtained, and the capacity region study serves as the basis to build the interference graph. Second, we present a distributed power-control algorithm suitable for any signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) regime. It rejects users and subcarriers with weighted SINR that is too low before operating in the high SINR regime for the remaining users and subcarriers. Both algorithms and their combination are assessed via dynamic simulations, where the weight of each user is proportional to its queue length. They are shown to significantly decrease resource consumption and efficiently balance users' queue lengths.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2009.2036268","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/5415848/05325745.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2009.2036268","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5415848","startPage":"896","endPage":"905","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Weighted Sum Throughput Maximization in Multicell OFDMA Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5325745","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Weighted Sum Throughput Maximization in Multicell OFDMA Networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5325745/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 November 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"59","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 2010","accessionNumber":"11149562","dateOfInsertion":"17 February 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5325745/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Weighted Sum Throughput Maximization in Multicell OFDMA Networks","sourcePdf":"tvt-pischella-2036268.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.079723S","chronDate":"Feb.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"5415848","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"5415848","articleId":"5325745","onlineDate":"10 November 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5325768,"authors":[{"name":"H.-J.

A collective of 33 subjects underwent a laboratory intervention that included mild cognitive load and two stress factors, which are relevant at the workplace: mental stress induced by solving arithmetic problems under time pressure and psychosocial stress induced by social-evaluative threat. During the experiments, a wearable device was used to monitor the EDA as a measure of the individual stress reaction. Analysis of the data showed that the distributions of the EDA peak height and the instantaneous peak rate carry information about the stress level of a person. Six classifiers were investigated regarding their ability to discriminate cognitive load from stress. A maximum accuracy of 82.8% was achieved for discriminating stress from cognitive load. This would allow keeping track of stressful phases during a working day by using a wearable EDA device.","doi":"10.1109/TITB.2009.2036164","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Technology in Biomedicine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Technology in Biomedicine","pdfPath":"/iel5/4233/5431105/05325784.pdf","startPage":"410","endPage":"417","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TITB.2009.2036164","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5431105","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Discriminating Stress From Cognitive Load Using a Wearable EDA Device","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5325784/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 November 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2010","displayDocTitle":"Discriminating Stress From Cognitive Load Using a Wearable EDA Device","volume":"14","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 2010","accessionNumber":"11171966","pubMedId":"19906598","htmlLink":"/document/5325784/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"15 March 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Discriminating Stress From Cognitive Load Using a Wearable EDA Device","sourcePdf":"titb-setz-2036164.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.069647S","chronDate":"March  2010","xplore-pub-id":"4233","isNumber":"5431105","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4233","citationCount":"306","xplore-issue":"5431105","articleId":"5325784","onlineDate":"10 November 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5325789,"authors":[{"name":"Shankar Kumar Selvaraja","affiliation":["Department of Information Technology, Ghent University-Inter University Microelectronics Center, Ghent, Belgium","Department of Information Technology, Ghent University\u2013Interuniversity Microelectronics Centre (IMEC), Ghent, Belgium"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/2944/5406274/5325789/5325789-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Shankar Kumar Selvaraja (S'06) received the M.Tech. degree in optical communication from the College of Engineering, Anna University, Chennai, India, in 2004, and the M.Sc. degree in microsystems and microelectronics from the University of Twente, Enschede, The Netherlands, in 2005.

Usually, a linear unmixed method is used for the purpose, which results in low estimation accuracy of subpixel land-surface temperature (LST). In this paper, we propose a novel method to estimate subpixel LST. This approach uses the characteristics of high spatial-resolution advanced spaceborne thermal emission and reflection radiometer (ASTER) VNIR data and the low spatial-resolution TIR data simulated from ASTER temperature product to generate the high spatial-resolution temperature data at a subpixel scale. First, the land-surface parameters (e.g., leaf area index, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), soil water content index, and reflectance) were extracted from VNIR data and field measurements. Then, the extracted high resolution of land-surface parameters and the LST were simulated into coarse resolutions. Second, the genetic algorithm and self-organizing feature map artificial neural network (ANN) was utilized to create relationships between land-surface parameters and the corresponding LSTs separately for different land-cover types at coarse spatial-resolution scales. Finally, the ANN-trained relationships were applied in the estimation of subpixel temperatures (at high spatial resolution) from high spatial-resolution land-surface parameters. The two sets of data with different spatial resolutions were simulated using an aggregate resampling algorithm. Experimental results indicate that the accuracy with our method to estimate land-surface subpixel temperature is significantly higher than that with a traditional method that uses the NDVI as an input parameter, and the average error of subpixel temperature is decreased by 2-3 K with our method. This method is a simple and convenient approach to estimate subpixel LST from high spatial-temporal resolution data quickly and effectively.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5325792/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 November 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11204347","volume":"48","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/5325792/","publicationDate":"April 2010","dateOfInsertion":"22 March 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Novel Method to Estimate Subpixel Temperature by Fusing Solar-Reflective and Thermal-Infrared Remote-Sensing Data With an Artificial Neural Network","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel Method to Estimate Subpixel Temperature by Fusing Solar-Reflective and Thermal-Infrared Remote-Sensing Data With an Artificial Neural Network","sourcePdf":"tgrs-yang-2033180.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073206S","chronDate":"April  2010","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"5437364","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"50","xplore-issue":"5437364","articleId":"5325792","onlineDate":"10 November 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5325803,"authors":[{"name":"Huaguang Zhang","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Engineering, Northeastern University, Shenyang, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/3477/5464482/5325803/5325803-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Huaguang Zhang (SM'04) received the B.S. degree and the M.S. degree in control engineering from Northeast Dianli University of China, Jilin City, China, in 1982 and 1985, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in thermal power engineering and automation from Southeast University, Nanjing, China, in 1991.","He joined the Department of Automatic Control, Northeastern University, Shenyang, China, in 1992, as a Postdoctoral Fellow for two years, where he has been a Professor and the Head of the Institute of Electric Automation, School of Information Science and Engineering, since 1994.

A novel impulsive control scheme (so-called dual-stage impulsive control) is proposed. Based on the theory of impulsive functional differential equations, a global exponential synchronization error bound together with some new sufficient conditions expressed in the form of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) is derived in order to guarantee that the synchronization error dynamics can converge to a predetermined level. Furthermore, to estimate the stable region, a novel optimization control algorithm is established, which can deal with the minimum problem with two nonlinear terms coexisting in LMIs effectively. The idea and approach developed in this paper can provide a more practical framework for the synchronization of multiperturbation delayed chaotic systems. Simulation results finally demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.","doi":"10.1109/TSMCB.2009.2030506","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)","pdfPath":"/iel5/3477/5464482/05325803.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSMCB.2009.2030506","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5464482","startPage":"831","endPage":"844","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust Global Exponential Synchronization of Uncertain Chaotic Delayed Neural Networks via Dual-Stage Impulsive Control","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5325803","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Robust Global Exponential Synchronization of Uncertain Chaotic Delayed Neural Networks via Dual-Stage Impulsive Control","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5325803/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 November 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"40","issue":"3","publicationDate":"June 2010","accessionNumber":"11293059","pubMedId":"19906592","dateOfInsertion":"13 May 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5325803/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust Global Exponential Synchronization of Uncertain Chaotic Delayed Neural Networks via Dual-Stage Impulsive Control","sourcePdf":"tsmcb-zhang-2030506-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.131336S","chronDate":"June  2010","xplore-pub-id":"3477","isNumber":"5464482","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3477","citationCount":"297","xplore-issue":"5464482","articleId":"5325803","onlineDate":"10 November 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5325813,"authors":[{"name":"Wen-Chung Chang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taipei University of Technology, Taipei, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/3477/5464482/5325813/5325813-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Wen-Chung Chang (S'92\u2013M'98) was born in Hualien City, Taiwan, in 1966.

It is an online AdaBoost approach for a cascade of strong classifiers instead of a single strong classifier. Most existing cascades of classifiers must be trained offline and cannot effectively be updated when online tuning is required. The idea is to develop a cascade of strong classifiers for vehicle detection that is capable of being online trained in response to changing traffic environments. To make the online algorithm tractable, the proposed system must efficiently tune parameters based on incoming images and up-to-date performance of each weak classifier. The proposed online boosting method can improve system adaptability and accuracy to deal with novel types of vehicles and unfamiliar environments, whereas existing offline methods rely much more on extensive training processes to reach comparable results and cannot further be updated online. Our approach has been successfully validated in real traffic environments by performing experiments with an onboard charge-coupled-device camera in a roadway vehicle.","doi":"10.1109/TSMCB.2009.2032527","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)","pdfPath":"/iel5/3477/5464482/05325813.pdf","startPage":"892","endPage":"902","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSMCB.2009.2032527","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5464482","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Online Boosting for Vehicle Detection","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5325813","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 November 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5325813/","displayDocTitle":"Online Boosting for Vehicle Detection","volume":"40","issue":"3","publicationDate":"June 2010","accessionNumber":"11293031","pubMedId":"19906591","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5325813/","dateOfInsertion":"13 May 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Online Boosting for Vehicle Detection","sourcePdf":"tsmcb-chang-2032527-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.197406S","chronDate":"June  2010","xplore-pub-id":"3477","isNumber":"5464482","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3477","citationCount":"87","xplore-issue":"5464482","articleId":"5325813","onlineDate":"10 November 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5325816,"authors":[{"name":"Jerzy J.

The available on-chip baseband processor serves as a tester while the RF front-end is under test enabled by on-chip test attenuator and in some cases by an offset mixer, too. Various system-level tests, like bit error rate, error vector magnitude, or spectral measurements are discussed. By using this technique in mass production, the RF test equipment can be largely avoided and the test cost reduced. Different variants of the loopback setup including the bypassing technique and RF detectors to boost the chip testability are considered. The existing limitations and tradeoffs are discussed in terms of test feasibility, controllability, and observability versus the chip performance. The fault-oriented approach supported by sensitization technique is put in contrast to the functional test. Also the impact of production tolerances is addressed in terms of a simple statistical model and the detectability thresholds. This paper is based on the present and previous work of the authors, largely revised and upgraded to provide a comprehensive description of the on-chip loopback test.

However, the poor flux estimation at very low speeds has been its largest drawback. A multitude of flux observers have been proposed for flux estimation, but most of them fail to fare in the low-speed region. This paper proposes a sliding-mode stator flux observer for improved flux estimation at very low speeds. Unlike conventional flux observers, this observer does not require any speed adaptation mechanism and is immune to speed estimation error. A novel stator resistance estimator is incorporated into the sensorless drive to compensate the effects of stator resistance variation. Global asymptotic stability of both the flux observer and stator resistance estimator is guaranteed by the Lyapunov stability analysis. DC-offset effects are mitigated by introducing a small integral component in the observer gains. Simulation and experimental results at very low speeds, including 0 and 2 r/min, without signal injection confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5325859/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 November 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"25","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2010","dateOfInsertion":"08 April 2010","accessionNumber":"11228330","htmlLink":"/document/5325859/","displayDocTitle":"Direct Torque Control of an IPM-Synchronous Motor Drive at Very Low Speed Using a Sliding-Mode Stator Flux Observer","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Direct Torque Control of an IPM-Synchronous Motor Drive at Very Low Speed Using a Sliding-Mode Stator Flux Observer","sourcePdf":"tpel-foo-2036354.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.100961S","chronDate":"April  2010","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"5443664","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"139","xplore-issue":"5443664","articleId":"5325859","onlineDate":"10 November 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-11"},{"_id":5325861,"authors":[{"name":"Nobuhiko Kikuchi","affiliation":["Central Research Laboratory, Hitachi and Limited, Kokubunji, Tokyo, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/50/5350899/5325861/5325861-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Nobuhiko Kikuchi (M'02) was born in Tokyo, Japan, in 1965.

These slots improve the input impedance bandwidth and the high frequency radiation characteristics. With this design, the reflection coefficient is lower than 10 dB in the 3.1-10.6 GHz frequency range and radiation pattern is similar to dipole antenna. With the inclusion of an additional small radiation patch, a frequency-notched antenna is also designed and good out of band performance from 5.0-6.0 GHz can be achieved.

In this paper, we advocate the use of generalized cardinal exponential splines-a class of compactly supported functions that is much richer than the existing B-spline family-for designing precision FDFs. One advantage of using generalized cardinal exponential splines is that it provides ready access to several spline families and other kernels which could be used for FDF design. The B-spline and Lagrange interpolator based FDFs are a special case of our proposition.

The proposed antenna is excited by a microstrip line placed parallel to the oblique side of an equilateral-triangular patch. The antenna exhibits linear polarization (LP), left-hand circular polarization, or right-hand circular polarization (RHCP) depending on whether the three identically sized corners of the triangular patch are cut. A novel reconfigurable microstrip antenna with selectable polarization is proposed based on this first antenna. This second antenna has a simple structure consisting of a corner-truncated triangular patch, a small triangular conductor, an asymmetrical microstrip feed line, and a biased PIN diode between the patch and the triangular conductor. It produces LP or RHCP depending on the bias voltage. The measured results show that this antenna has a low cross-polarization level when operated in the linear state and a good axial ratio in the circular state.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8/5443538/05325875.pdf","startPage":"1039","endPage":"1046","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2009.2036277","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2009.2036277","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5443538","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5325875","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Investigation Into the Polarization of Asymmetrical- Feed Triangular Microstrip Antennas and its Application to Reconfigurable Antennas","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Microstrip antennas","Antenna feeds","Optical polarization","Log periodic antennas","Antenna measurements","Conductors","Receiving antennas","Radar antennas","Circuits","Diodes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna feeds","antenna radiation patterns","electromagnetic wave polarisation","microstrip antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["asymmetrical-feed triangular microstrip antennas","single-feed equilateral-triangular microstrip antenna","diverse radiation polarizations","linear polarization","left-hand circular polarization","right-hand circular polarization","reconfigurable microstrip antenna","corner-truncated triangular patch","triangular conductor","asymmetrical microstrip feed line","biased PIN diode"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Circular polarization","equilateral-triangular patch","reconfigurable antenna"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5325875/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 November 2009","displayDocTitle":"Investigation Into the Polarization of Asymmetrical- Feed Triangular Microstrip Antennas and its Application to Reconfigurable Antennas","volume":"58","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/5325875/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2010","accessionNumber":"11220575","dateOfInsertion":"05 April 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Investigation Into the Polarization of Asymmetrical- Feed Triangular Microstrip Antennas and its Application to Reconfigurable Antennas","sourcePdf":"tap-ysung-2036277.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.093262S","chronDate":"April  2010","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"5443538","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"38","xplore-issue":"5443538","articleId":"5325875","onlineDate":"10 November 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5325877,"authors":[{"name":"Karl Martin","affiliation":["Edward S.

From a system perspective, we investigate issues ranging from image preprocessing, feature extraction, to cryptography, error-correcting coding/decoding, key binding, and bit allocation. In simulation studies, the proposed biometric encryption system is tested on the CMU PIE face database. An important observation from the simulation results is that in the proposed system, the biometric encryption module tends to significantly reduce the false acceptance rate with a marginal increase in the false rejection rate.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Systems Journal","pdfPath":"/iel5/4267003/5394076/05325877.pdf","startPage":"440","endPage":"450","publicationTitle":"IEEE Systems Journal","doi":"10.1109/JSYST.2009.2034944","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSYST.2009.2034944","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5394076","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5325877","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Biometric Encryption System for the Self-Exclusion Scenario of Face Recognition","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Biometrics","Cryptography","Face recognition","Privacy","Feature extraction","Image coding","Decoding","Bit rate","System testing","Image databases"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biometrics (access control)","cryptography","error correction codes","face recognition","feature extraction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biometric encryption system","face recognition","self-exclusion scenario","image preprocessing","feature extraction","cryptography","key binding","bit allocation","error-correcting coding","error-correcting decoding"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Biometric encryption","face recognition","privacy","security","self exclusion","watch list"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5325877/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 November 2009","displayDocTitle":"A Biometric Encryption System for the Self-Exclusion Scenario of Face Recognition","volume":"3","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/5325877/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"11133923","dateOfInsertion":"26 January 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Biometric Encryption System for the Self-Exclusion Scenario of Face Recognition","sourcePdf":"03jsyst04-hlu-2034944.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.129171S","chronDate":"Dec.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"4267003","isNumber":"5394076","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4267003","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"5394076","articleId":"5325877","onlineDate":"10 November 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5325878,"authors":[{"name":"Guangyue Xu","affiliation":["Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Guangyue Xu (S'08) received the B.E. degree in electrical engineering from Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China, in 2004 and the M.S. degree from the Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China, in 2007.

Controlled islanding is employed as a corrective measure of last resort to prevent cascading outages caused by large disturbances. The large scale power system is represented as a graph and a simplification algorithm is used to reduce the complexity of the system. Generators belonging to the same slowly coherent group are collapsed into a dummy node, and a graph partition library is used to split the graph into a given number of parts. Some extra islands formed by the partition library are merged into their adjacent large islands and the original cutset of the actual power system is recovered from the highly simplified graph.

Power gating is a promising technique. Our research emphasizes that with the latest and future technologies, power gating operates frequently in its transition mode, especially for aggressive leakage reduction. The dynamic characteristics of power gating during its mode transition is critical for making design decision. Hence we derive a fast, accurate, and temperature-aware model to characterize the dynamic behavior of power gating during mode transition. The applications of this model include the estimation of several key design parameters for power gating, such as dynamic virtual ground voltage, dynamic leakage variation and energy break-even time. It provides an efficient estimation engine for power gating design optimization. The accuracy of the model has been verified by extensive HSPICE experiments. The model is computationally efficient due to the usage of various approximation methods.","doi":"10.1109/TVLSI.2009.2033699","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/92/5695105/05325881.pdf","startPage":"237","endPage":"249","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVLSI.2009.2033699","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5695105","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamic Characteristics of Power Gating During Mode Transition","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5325881","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 November 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5325881/","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic Characteristics of Power Gating During Mode Transition","volume":"19","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 2011","accessionNumber":"11762133","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5325881/","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic Characteristics of Power Gating During Mode Transition","sourcePdf":"tvlsi-hxu-2033699-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.07936S","chronDate":"Feb.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"5695105","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"5695105","articleId":"5325881","onlineDate":"10 November 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5325883,"authors":[{"name":"St\u00c9phane van Roy","affiliation":["OPERA Department, Universit\u00e9 Libre de Bruxelles, Brussels, Belgium","Microwave Laboratory, Catholic University\uc2a0of\uc2a0Leuven, Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgium"],"firstName":"St\u00c9phane","lastName":"van Roy","id":"37670943100"},{"name":"Claude Oestges","affiliation":["Microwave Laboratory, Catholic University\uc2a0of\uc2a0Leuven, Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgium"],"firstName":"Claude","lastName":"Oestges","id":"37278300500"},{"name":"Fran\u00c7ois Horlin","affiliation":["OPERA Department, Universit\u00e9 Libre de Bruxelles, Brussels, Belgium"],"firstName":"Fran\u00c7ois","lastName":"Horlin","id":"37268157100"},{"name":"Philippe De Doncker","affiliation":["OPERA Department, Universit\u00e9 Libre de Bruxelles, Brussels, Belgium"],"firstName":"Philippe","lastName":"De Doncker","id":"37319019000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-926X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2221"}],"articleNumber":"5325883","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":30,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":849},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society","url":"http://www.ieeeaps.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Body area networks","Sensor arrays","Biological system modeling","Biosensors","Ultra wideband antennas","Humans","Ultra wideband technology","Antenna arrays","Analytical models","Diffraction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","body area networks","body sensor networks","sensor fusion","ultra wideband antennas","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["body area networks","UWB multisensor multiantenna","biological sensors","antenna array","IEEE 802.15.4a","on-body diffracted waves mechanism","innovative space-time correlation model"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Body area networks","multisensor multiantenna","spatial correlation","ultrawideband (UWB)"]}],"abstract":"Body area networks consist of a number of biological sensors communicating over the air with a central sink placed in close proximity of the human body.

This wearable system uses on-body acceleration sensors to measure the patients' movements. It automatically detects FOG by analyzing frequency components inherent in these movements. When FOG is detected, the assistant provides a rhythmic auditory signal that stimulates the patient to resume walking. Ten PD patients tested the system while performing several walking tasks in the laboratory. More than 8 h of data were recorded. Eight patients experienced FOG during the study, and 237 FOG events were identified by professional physiotherapists in a post hoc video analysis. Our wearable assistant was able to provide online assistive feedback for PD patients when they experienced FOG.

We describe an alternative iterative algorithm for recovering the signal, which involves only LTI operations. In the revised method, each iteration is much faster and implementation is simpler.

Growing demand for ultralow-power receivers for short-range radios has recently reawakened an interest in the theory and design of SRAs. Building on recent work and using reasonable assumptions and approximations, we present a frequency-domain model for analyzing SRAs. We then use these models to predict the response of an SRA to arbitrary deterministic and stochastic signals including sinusoids, pulsed-sinusoids, and additive white Gaussian noise. Using the results, we present formulas for calculating the sensitivity and selectivity of SRAs. We also introduce the concept of a trigger-time that is particularly useful for accurately determining the optimal threshold in on-off keying (OOK) receivers and helps avoid the problems introduced by nonlinearity in SRAs.

The fourth wire is taken out from the midpoint of the isolation transformer in order to avoid the necessity of an extra leg. This makes the converter suitable for unbalanced loads and eliminates the requirements of bulky capacitor in half-bridge inverter. The closed-loop control is carried out in stationary reference frame using proportional + multiresonant controller (three separate resonant controller for fundamental, fifth and seventh harmonic components). The limitations on improving steady-state response of harmonic resonance controllers is investigated and mitigated using a lead-lag compensator. The proposed voltage controller is used along with an inner current loop to ensure excellent performance of the power converter.

The adaptive power supply is a noninverting buck-boost power converter. It is shown that precise output voltage positioning and low output voltage ripple over a wide output voltage range, including buck, boost, and buck/boost transition modes, can be accomplished using \u00bf-\u00bf modulation in combination with a small, low-resolution DPWM core. A two-mode digital controller is presented, in which the compensator parameters are changed upon buck/boost mode transitions in order to improve closed-loop dynamic performance. Furthermore, improvements in system efficiency are demonstrated using this adaptive power supply combined with an adaptive RF impedance tuner between the RFPA and the antenna. The results are verified on an experimental test bed that consists of a discrete RFPA, impedance tuner, a prototype 0.5 \u00bfm CMOS power stage IC that integrates power MOSFETs, drivers and deadtime control logic, and a digital power management controller implemented on an FPGA.","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2009.2036355","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/63/5443664/05325908.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2009.2036355","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5443664","startPage":"981","endPage":"991","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Power Management of Wideband Code Division Multiple Access RF Power Amplifiers With Antenna Mismatch","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5325908","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Power Management of Wideband Code Division Multiple Access RF Power Amplifiers With Antenna Mismatch","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5325908/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 November 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"25","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 2010","accessionNumber":"11228328","dateOfInsertion":"08 April 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5325908/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power Management of Wideband Code Division Multiple Access RF Power Amplifiers With Antenna Mismatch","sourcePdf":"tpel-paul-2036355.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.093234S","chronDate":"April  2010","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"5443664","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"35","xplore-issue":"5443664","articleId":"5325908","onlineDate":"10 November 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5325909,"authors":[{"name":"M.

It is very unlikely that computers will become intelligent as humans in this sense by just increasing the number of transistors on CPU chips. How can we approach this problem by learning from biological systems of their computing principles? This is the main theme of this article. We are aiming to develop a new-paradigm computing system most suited to such human-like intelligent information processing by best utilizing the state-of-the-art silicon technology. For this end, we have developed a series of VLSI chips dedicated to specific brain-mimicking processing using digital, analog as well as mixed-signal circuit technologies. There is an opportunity of even using exotic current-voltage characteristics of nano functional devices directly in such computation. In this paper, we will also discuss how we can circumvent the serious issue of the nanoscale integration, i.e., the variability problem of device characteristics that is inherent in nanoscale devices.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Proceedings of ESSCIRC","pdfPath":"/iel5/5307451/5325915/05325934.pdf","startPage":"8","endPage":"15","publicationTitle":"2009 Proceedings of ESSCIRC","doi":"10.1109/ESSCIRC.2009.5325934","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ESSCIRC.2009.5325934","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5325915","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5325934","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bio-inspired devices, circuits and systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Circuits and systems","Biology computing","Humans","Nanoscale devices","Computational intelligence","Central Processing Unit","Biological systems","Information processing","Silicon","Very large scale integration"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital computers","elemental semiconductors","mixed analogue-digital integrated circuits","nanoelectronics","silicon","VLSI"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bioinspired devices","digital computers","human-like intelligent information processing","state-of-the-art silicon technology","VLSI chips","brain-mimicking processing","mixed-signal circuits","current-voltage characteristics","nanofunctional devices","nanoscale integration","Si"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5325934/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 Sept. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Bio-inspired devices, circuits and systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5325934/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10975378","dateOfInsertion":"10 November 2009","conferenceDate":"14-18 Sept. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bio-inspired devices, circuits and systems","confLoc":"Athens, Greece","sourcePdf":"3451.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.091025S","chronDate":"14-18 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5307451","isNumber":"5325915","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5307451","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5325915","articleId":"5325934","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5325939,"authors":[{"name":"Armin Tajalli","affiliation":["Microelectronic Systems Laboratory (LSM), Ecole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Armin","lastName":"Tajalli","id":"37269997800"},{"name":"Yusuf Leblebici","affiliation":["Microelectronic Systems Laboratory (LSM), Ecole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Yusuf","lastName":"Leblebici","id":"37276561900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4355-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4354-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1930-8833"}],"articleNumber":"5325939","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":492},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5325939","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Random access memory","Digital systems","Circuit topology","CMOS memory circuits","Energy consumption","CMOS technology","CMOS logic circuits","Logic circuits","Subthreshold current","Digital circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS memory circuits","leakage currents","low-power electronics","SRAM chips"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ultra low power SRAM","low activity rate digital systems","source coupled logic power efficiency","subthreshold leakage consumption","CMOS circuits","static random access memory"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ESSCIRC.2009.5325939","endPage":"167","startPage":"164","publicationTitle":"2009 Proceedings of ESSCIRC","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Proceedings of ESSCIRC","pdfPath":"/iel5/5307451/5325915/05325939.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ESSCIRC.2009.5325939","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5325915","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Subthreshold SCL for ultra-low-power SRAM and low-activity-rate digital systems","abstract":"The power efficiency of source-coupled logic (SCL) topology for implementing ultra-low-power and low-activity-rate circuits is investigated. It is shown that in low-activity-rate circuits, where the subthreshold leakage consumption of conventional CMOS circuits is more pronounced, subthreshold SCL (STSCL) can be used effectively for reducing the power consumption. An STSCL-based static random-access memory (SRAM) array has been implemented to demonstrate the performance of this topology for ultra-low-power consumption and low-activity-rate digital circuits. A novel 9 T memory cell has been developed to reduce the stand-by (leakage) current to 10 pA/cell while the SRAM array is operating at 2.1 MHz clock frequency. The power consumption benefits of the proposed circuit style can be maintained in nanometer CMOS technology nodes.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 Sept. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5325939/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5325939/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10975382","conferenceDate":"14-18 Sept. 2009","publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"10 November 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Subthreshold SCL for ultra-low-power SRAM and low-activity-rate digital systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Subthreshold SCL for ultra-low-power SRAM and low-activity-rate digital systems","confLoc":"Athens, Greece","sourcePdf":"3398.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062955S","chronDate":"14-18 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5307451","isNumber":"5325915","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5307451","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"5325915","articleId":"5325939","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5325942,"authors":[{"name":"H.

The second-stage employs chopper-stabilization (CHS), while SF buffer shields the MCM sensor from the switching spurs. The PAMP uses MW poly bias resistors for the second-stage, exploiting Miller effect to achieve flat audio-band response. The gain and high-pass filtering corner can be adjusted by digitally controlling the capacitor banks in the PAMP.

Classical Static Noise Margin (SNM) is mostly suitable for single-cell simulation. Read Margin (RM) measurement allows analysis of large arrays and correlates to SNM, but requires a dedicated test structure and long measurement time. The presented method analyzes the flipping of cells over varying supply voltage. The stability of large arrays can be characterized in read as well as in hold state depending on the state of the access transistors.

It delivers most of its maximum output power even with an active load disturbing the PA output with parasitic high power signals. Other features are its excellent output return loss and four point on-chip power generation, decreasing coupling effects. The differential input quadrature splitter and both differential amplifier cores have been integrated on one die measuring 1400 mum times 900 mum. The device has been optimized for operation at S-band (2.9 GHz ... 3.1 GHz) and reaches a small signal gain of 51 dB with a maximum saturated output power of 24.2 dBm. The double balanced PA withstands active load signals of 18 dBm with a low output power penalty of 2.5 dB. Its high tolerance against parasitic element coupling makes the highly integrated device an excellent choice for transmit/receive modules of low-cost commercial phased arrays.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5325915","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ESSCIRC.2009.5325990","publicationTitle":"2009 Proceedings of ESSCIRC","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Proceedings of ESSCIRC","pdfPath":"/iel5/5307451/5325915/05325990.pdf","startPage":"180","endPage":"183","doi":"10.1109/ESSCIRC.2009.5325990","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A double balanced power amplifier for S-band phased arrays in SiGe BiCMOS","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 Sept. 2009","displayDocTitle":"A double balanced power amplifier for S-band phased arrays in SiGe BiCMOS","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"14-18 Sept. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5325990/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10975330","dateOfInsertion":"10 November 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5325990/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A double balanced power amplifier for S-band phased arrays in SiGe BiCMOS","confLoc":"Athens, Greece","sourcePdf":"3163.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046524S","chronDate":"14-18 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5307451","isNumber":"5325915","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5307451","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5325915","articleId":"5325990","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5325992,"authors":[{"name":"Benno Krabbenborg","affiliation":["NXP Semiconductors, Netherlands"],"firstName":"Benno","lastName":"Krabbenborg","id":"37284232200"},{"name":"Marco Berkhout","affiliation":["NXP Semiconductors, Netherlands"],"firstName":"Marco","lastName":"Berkhout","id":"37391981100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4355-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4354-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1930-8833"}],"articleNumber":"5325992","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":385},"abstract":"In many integrated class-D audio amplifiers large linear capacitors are used to create the triangular reference signals for generation of PWM signals.

The overall hardware cost was optimized by a very compact on-the-fly key expansion unit and a highly integrated encryption/decryption datapath. The compact on-the-fly key expansion unit is achieved by sharing expansion processes of different key lengths. The integrated data datapath shares hardware resources between encryption and decryption.

In this paper, we present improvements in the illumination compensation method called Self Quotient Image (SQI) applied to face recognition. Using genetic algorithms (GA) we select parameters of the SQI method to improve face recognition. The parameters optimized by the GA were: the fraction of the mean value within the region for the SQI, selection of arctangent, sigmoid, hyperbolic tangent or minimum functions, and the values for the weights of each filter are selected within the range 0 and 1. We compare results of our proposed method to those with no illumination compensation and to those previously published for SQI method. We use four internationally available face databases: Yale B, CMU PIE, AR, color FERET (grayscaled), where the first two contain face images with significant changes in illumination conditions, and the third one contains face images with slight changes in illumination conditions. Our method performs better than SQI in images with non-homogeneous illumination.","doi":"10.1109/ISOT.2009.5326048","pdfPath":"/iel5/5299297/5326038/05326048.pdf","startPage":"322","endPage":"327","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Symposium on Optomechatronic Technologies","publicationTitle":"2009 International Symposium on Optomechatronic Technologies","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISOT.2009.5326048","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5326038","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Illumination compensation for face recognition by genetic optimization of the Self-Quotient Image method","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5326048/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 Sept. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Illumination compensation for face recognition by genetic optimization of the Self-Quotient Image method","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"10 November 2009","accessionNumber":"10974758","publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5326048/","conferenceDate":"21-23 Sept. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Illumination compensation for face recognition by genetic optimization of the Self-Quotient Image method","confLoc":"Istanbul, Turkey","sourcePdf":"56ISOT324.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.083497S","chronDate":"21-23 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5299297","isNumber":"5326038","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5299297","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"5326038","articleId":"5326048","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5326082,"authors":[{"name":"Naoyuki Kubota","affiliation":["Department of System Design, Tokyo Metropolitan University, Hino, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Naoyuki","lastName":"Kubota","id":"37275324300"},{"name":"Takenori Obo","affiliation":["Department of System Design, Tokyo Metropolitan University, Hino, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Takenori","lastName":"Obo","id":"37590789400"},{"name":"Toshio Fukuda","affiliation":["Department of Micro Systems, University of Nagoya, Japan"],"firstName":"Toshio","lastName":"Fukuda","id":"37279174500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5081-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1944-9445"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1944-9437"}],"articleNumber":"5326082","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":15,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":137},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Intelligent sensors","Intelligent systems","Intelligent networks","Monitoring","Sensor systems","Humans","Data security","Biological system modeling","Intelligent robots","Wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["emotion recognition","knowledge based systems","sensor fusion","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["intelligent monitoring system","emotional model","sensor networks","image processing","wireless sensor networks"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5326082","doi":"10.1109/ROMAN.2009.5326082","publicationTitle":"RO-MAN 2009 - The 18th IEEE International Symposium on Robot and Human Interactive Communication","abstract":"This paper proposes an intelligent monitoring system based on emotional model in sensor networks.

Complex interactions are now possible, where children interact and learn from robots. A pilot study attempted to determine which features in robots led to changes in learning and behavior. Three common learning styles, lecture, cooperative, and self-directed, were implemented into ASIMO to see if children can learn from robots. General features such as monotone robot-like voice and human-like voice were compared. Thirty-seven children between the ages 4-to 10- years participated in the study. Each child engaged in a table-setting task with ASIMO that exhibited different learning styles and general features. Children answered questions in relation to a table-setting task with a learning measure.

First the robot learns object names. Then it uses the known object names to learn parameterized command patterns and determine the position of parameters in a spoken command. The algorithm uses a combination of hidden Markov models and classical conditioning to handle alternative ways to utter the same command and integrate information from different modalities.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5326035","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ROMAN.2009.5326220","publicationTitle":"RO-MAN 2009 - The 18th IEEE International Symposium on Robot and Human Interactive Communication","displayPublicationTitle":"RO-MAN 2009 - The 18th IEEE International Symposium on Robot and Human Interactive Communication","pdfPath":"/iel5/5306517/5326035/05326220.pdf","startPage":"757","endPage":"762","doi":"10.1109/ROMAN.2009.5326220","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Learning to understand parameterized commands through a human-robot training task","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 27 2009-Oct. 2 2009","displayDocTitle":"Learning to understand parameterized commands through a human-robot training task","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"27 Sept.-2 Oct. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5326220/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10975165","dateOfInsertion":"10 November 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5326220/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Learning to understand parameterized commands through a human-robot training task","confLoc":"Toyama, Japan","sourcePdf":"0172.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040912S","chronDate":"Sept. 27 2009-Oct. 2 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5306517","isNumber":"5326035","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5306517","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5326035","articleId":"5326220","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5326292,"authors":[{"name":"I.

Limited research to date has studied the influence of users' attributes (such as age and gender) on the acceptance of service robots and the implications for HRI design. This paper describes the development of a social interactive healthcare robot named Charles, capable of measuring blood pressure. Using blood pressure monitoring as the service scenario, a user study was conducted to investigate the differences between two age groups (40 to 65 years and over 65 years) in attitudes and reactions before and after their interactions with Charles. The results showed few differences between the two age groups. A significant gender effect was found, with males having a more positive attitude toward robots in healthcare than females. This study reveals the importance of considering gender issues in the design of healthcare robots for older people. Overall, the performance of the robot was rated high, however the participants expressed desires to have more interactiveness and a better voice from the robot. According to our sample, age need not be a barrier to users' acceptance of healthcare robots.","displayPublicationTitle":"RO-MAN 2009 - The 18th IEEE International Symposium on Robot and Human Interactive Communication","pdfPath":"/iel5/5306517/5326035/05326292.pdf","startPage":"214","endPage":"219","publicationTitle":"RO-MAN 2009 - The 18th IEEE International Symposium on Robot and Human Interactive Communication","doi":"10.1109/ROMAN.2009.5326292","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ROMAN.2009.5326292","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5326035","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5326292","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Age and gender factors in user acceptance of healthcare robots","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Medical services","Human robot interaction","Medical robotics","Aging","Robot sensing systems","Positron emission tomography","Service robots","Blood pressure","Biomedical monitoring","Medical diagnostic imaging"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["gender issues","health care","human-robot interaction","medical robotics","service robots"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["gender factor","user acceptance","human robot interaction","service robot","social interactive healthcare robot","Charles healthcare robot","blood pressure measuring robot","age factor"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5326292/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 27 2009-Oct. 2 2009","displayDocTitle":"Age and gender factors in user acceptance of healthcare robots","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5326292/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10975239","dateOfInsertion":"10 November 2009","conferenceDate":"27 Sept.-2 Oct. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Age and gender factors in user acceptance of healthcare robots","confLoc":"Toyama, Japan","sourcePdf":"0088.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.1014S","chronDate":"Sept. 27 2009-Oct. 2 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5306517","isNumber":"5326035","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5306517","citationCount":"76","xplore-issue":"5326035","articleId":"5326292","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5326341,"authors":[{"name":"Stefanos Nikolaidis","affiliation":["Department of Precision Engineering, School of Engineering, University of Tokyo, Bunkyo, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Stefanos","lastName":"Nikolaidis","id":"37643766400"},{"name":"Tamio Arai","affiliation":["Department of Precision Engineering, School of Engineering, University of Tokyo, Bunkyo, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Tamio","lastName":"Arai","id":"37281361000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5081-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1944-9445"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1944-9437"}],"articleNumber":"5326341","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":84},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5326341","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robot vision systems","Cameras","Service robots","Genetic algorithms","Robot kinematics","Robot sensing systems","Robot localization","Art","Senior citizens","Educational technology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cameras","genetic algorithms","minimisation","mobile robots","position control","sensors","service robots"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimal camera arrangement","ceiling camera pose","home service robot position","genetic algorithm","external sensor","robot localization error minimization","single objective optimization problem","multiobjective optimization problem"]}],"abstract":"In the near future robots will be used in home environments to provide assistance for the elderly and challenged people.

Exterior magnetic fields higher than the saturation field lead to an irremediable loss of the stored information because the antiferromagnetic state of the synthetic antiferromagnetic (SAF) structure becomes a ferromagnetic state and data stored in the magnetic memory cell are altered. At the saturation point, the two ferromagnetic-layer magnetizations became parallel oriented, in a direction close to that of the applied field. In this paper, we present a method to find an analytical formula for the magnetic saturation field that depends on the angle between the applied magnetic field related to the easy anisotropy axis, on the amplitude of the antiferromagnetic coupling field between the ferromagnetic layers, on the geometrical characteristics of the SAF structure, and on the second term of the series expansion of the anisotropy energy of the system. This method allows us to obtain an analytical formula for saturation field that depends only on the controllable parameters of the SAF structure. This analytically obtained critical saturation curve perfectly matches with the critical saturation curve reported in previous papers.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Antiferromagnetic materials","Magnetic anisotropy","Perpendicular magnetic anisotropy","Saturation magnetization","Magnetic fields","Anisotropic magnetoresistance","Random access memory","Magnetic memory","Magnetic analysis","Couplings"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antiferromagnetism","ferromagnetism","interface magnetism","magnetic anisotropy","MRAM devices"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["toggle magnetic random access memory cell","synthetic antiferromagnetic structure","ferromagnetic-layer magnetizations","magnetic saturation field","antiferromagnetic coupling field","anisotropy energy","critical saturation curve","exterior magnetic fields"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MRAM","SAF","saturation curve","saturation field","toggle mode"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5326447","doi":"10.1109/TMAG.2009.2023118","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/20/5326426/05326447.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMAG.2009.2023118","startPage":"5266","endPage":"5270","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5326426","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Saturation Curve for a Synthetic Antiferromagnetic System","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Saturation Curve for a Synthetic Antiferromagnetic System","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5326447/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 November 2009","volume":"45","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/5326447/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"17 November 2009","publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"10979057","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Saturation Curve for a Synthetic Antiferromagnetic System","sourcePdf":"tmag-olariu-2023118.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.119164S","chronDate":"Dec.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"20","isNumber":"5326426","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5326426","articleId":"5326447","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5326448,"authors":[{"name":"Antti Laiho","affiliation":["VTT Industrial Systems, Espoo, Finland"],"bio":{"p":["Antti Laiho was born in Helsinki, Finland, in 1977.

If one wants to apply PSO one has to specify several parameters as well as to select a neighborhood topology. Several topologies being widely used can be found in literature. This raises the question, which one fits best to your application at hand. To get rid of this topology selection problem, a new concept called Polymorphic Particle Swarm Optimization (PolyPSO) is proposed. PolyPSO generalizes the standard update rule by a polymorphic update rule. The mathematical expression of this polymorphic update rule can be changed on symbolic level. This polymorphic update rule is an adaptive update rule changing symbols based on accumulative histograms and roulette-wheel sampling. PolyPSO is applied to four typical benchmark functions known from literature. In most cases it outperforms the other PSO variants under consideration. Since PolyPSO performs not worse it can be used as alternative to solve this way the topology selection problem.","doi":"10.1109/ICAIS.2009.30","startPage":"135","endPage":"140","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Adaptive and Intelligent Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICAIS.2009.30","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5327747","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Adaptive and Intelligent Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5327746/5327747/05327799.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Particle Swarm Optimization with Polymorphic Update Rules","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5327799/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Particle Swarm Optimization with Polymorphic Update Rules","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5327799/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11046334","publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"17 November 2009","conferenceDate":"24-26 Sept. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 Sept. 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Particle Swarm Optimization with Polymorphic Update Rules","confLoc":"Klagenfurt, Austria","sourcePdf":"3827a135.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067247S","chronDate":"24-26 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5327746","isNumber":"5327747","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5327746","xplore-issue":"5327747","articleId":"5327799","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5327801,"authors":[{"name":"Pawan Verma","affiliation":["VLSI-ES Division, Centre for Development of Advanced Computing, Mohali, India"],"firstName":"Pawan","lastName":"Verma","id":"37668550000"},{"name":"Harpreet Kaur","affiliation":["VLSI-ES Division, Centre for Development of Advanced Computing, Mohali, India"],"firstName":"Harpreet","lastName":"Kaur","id":"37666992200"},{"name":"Mandeep Singh","affiliation":["VLSI-ES Division, Centre for Development of Advanced Computing, Mohali, India"],"firstName":"Mandeep","lastName":"Singh","id":"37677799700"},{"name":"Balwinder Singh","affiliation":["VLSI-ES Division, Centre for Development of Advanced Computing, Mohali, India"],"firstName":"Balwinder","lastName":"Singh","id":"37067261000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5104-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-3845-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5327801","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1101},"abstract":"In many applications high-speed performance is required. For this purpose, conventional multi-carrier techniques are usually chosen, but this results in the lowering of spectrum efficiency. So, the principles of orthogonal frequency division multiplexing are used in such applications. This paper gives the details of the development of IFFT & FFT algorithms to be used in OFDM systems based on the IEEE 802.11a standard for WLAN. This system consists of separate OFDM transmitter & receiver. Actually, in the entire architecture of OFDM system, all the mathematical manipulations take place in these two blocks only, i.e. IFFT & FFT blocks while rest of the blocks convert the data from one format to another format. In this paper we have implemented FFT and IFFT blocks in VHDL. The speed enhancement is the key contribution of the main processing blocks in OFDM system.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Advances in Recent Technologies in Communication and Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5327739/5327740/05327801.pdf","startPage":"186","endPage":"188","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Advances in Recent Technologies in Communication and Computing","doi":"10.1109/ARTCom.2009.140","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ARTCom.2009.140","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5327740","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5327801","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"VHDL Implementation of FFT/IFFT Blocks for OFDM","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Diodes","MOS devices","Electrostatic discharge","Protection","Low voltage","CMOS technology","Capacitance","Isolation technology","Robustness"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fast Fourier transforms","hardware description languages","OFDM modulation","radio receivers","radio transmitters","telecommunication standards","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","VHDL implementation","FFT/IFFT blocks","inverse fast Fourier transform","multicarrier techniques","IEEE 802.11a standard","WLAN","OFDM transmitter","OFDM receiver"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["FFT","IFFT","OFDM VHDL Simulation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5327801/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-28 Oct. 2009","displayDocTitle":"VHDL Implementation of FFT/IFFT Blocks for OFDM","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5327801/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"10978596","dateOfInsertion":"17 November 2009","conferenceDate":"27-28 Oct. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"VHDL Implementation of FFT/IFFT Blocks for OFDM","confLoc":"Kottayam, India","sourcePdf":"3845a186.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064601S","chronDate":"27-28 Oct. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5327739","isNumber":"5327740","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5327739","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5327740","articleId":"5327801","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5327825,"authors":[{"name":"Kazuhiro Matsui","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science College of Engineering, Nihon University, Koriyama, Japan"],"firstName":"Kazuhiro","lastName":"Matsui","id":"37412488800"},{"name":"Haruo Sato","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science College of Engineering, Nihon University, Koriyama, Japan"],"firstName":"Haruo","lastName":"Sato","id":"37420573700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3827-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5327825","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":258},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5327825","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Genetic algorithms","Biological cells","Computer science","Educational institutions","Genetic engineering","Encoding","Evolutionary computation","Financial management","Share prices","Adaptive systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["commerce","genetic algorithms","genomics","stock markets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["stock trading strategy","genetic algorithms","automatic trading methods","financial markets","genotype coding methods","technical indicators","allele-based indirect coding","Tokyo Stock Exchange","cumulative profits","computational costs"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Stock trading","Genetic algorithm","Algorithmic trade"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICAIS.2009.29","pdfPath":"/iel5/5327746/5327747/05327825.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Adaptive and Intelligent Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Adaptive and Intelligent Systems","startPage":"129","endPage":"134","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5327747","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICAIS.2009.29","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Comparison of Genotype Representations to Acquire Stock Trading Strategy Using Genetic Algorithms","abstract":"Automatic trading methods are important issues in recent financial markets. In this paper, we compare some genotype coding methods of technical indicators and their parameters to acquire stock trading strategy using genetic algorithms (GAs). In previous works, the locus-based representation is widely used for encoding technical indicators on chromosomes in GAs, and the direct coding is also widely adopted for encoding the parameters of the indicators. However, these conventional methods are not so effective for the GA search. Therefore, we propose a new genotype coding methods, namely the allele-based indirect coding. We examine the performance of the proposed and conventional coding methods in stock trading of twenty companies in the first section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange for recent ten years. In our empirical results, the allele-based indirect coding is superior to the other ones both on the cumulative profits and the computational costs.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 Sept. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5327825/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11046323","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5327825/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"17 November 2009","conferenceDate":"24-26 Sept. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Comparison of Genotype Representations to Acquire Stock Trading Strategy Using Genetic Algorithms","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Comparison of Genotype Representations to Acquire Stock Trading Strategy Using Genetic Algorithms","confLoc":"Klagenfurt, Austria","sourcePdf":"3827a129.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.08083S","chronDate":"24-26 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5327746","isNumber":"5327747","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5327746","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5327747","articleId":"5327825","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5327841,"authors":[{"name":"Kamatham Harikrishna","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Computer Engineering, Narayana Engineering College, Nellore, Andhra Pradesh, India"],"firstName":"Kamatham","lastName":"Harikrishna","id":"38258851700"},{"name":"T.

Here in this paper we have attempted to simulate the physical layer that takes into consideration vehicular mobility associated and time based changing effects for a typical WiMAX IEEE 802.16e-2005 channel-environment. In the first phase, we have mainly considered the NLOS WiMAX link and then developed a channel model that incorporates Doppler effect and simulated the whole link. The results of the simulations depicts that effects of doppler being not very serious for single carrier transmissions, however, during multi-carrier transmissions the effect are serious and requires more rigorous modeling especially with MIMO and study to estimate the channel response. The mentioned channel effects, perturb the orthogonality (amongst the carriers) as the sub-carriers being very close to each other. While, in the second phase of our study, issues related to estimation at the receiver end (processing) have been dealt with vis-agrave-vis, fast fading and frequency selective effects (due to vehicular mobility) in frequency domain, frequency domain power spectrum estimation methods (most changes are observed in frequency domain). To estimate a time varying, MIMO Doppler channel using spectrum estimation methods, a imposed pilot pattern is used as this consumes minimum spectrum and lesser power though it differs from the standard. Through this simulation study, channel estimation issues are investigated, discussed and presented.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Advances in Recent Technologies in Communication and Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5327739/5327740/05328068.pdf","startPage":"93","endPage":"97","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Advances in Recent Technologies in Communication and Computing","doi":"10.1109/ARTCom.2009.65","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ARTCom.2009.65","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5327740","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5328068","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Simulation of NLOS WiMAX-IEEE 802.16e Physical Layer Using MIMO Doppler Channel Model with Imposed Comb Pilots","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["WiMAX","Physical layer","MIMO","Frequency domain analysis","Frequency estimation","Spectral analysis","OFDM","Doppler effect","Phase estimation","Fading"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","MIMO communication","WiMax"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["NLOS WiMAX-IEEE 802.16e physical layer","MIMO Doppler channel model","imposed comb pilots","vehicular mobility","channel response","frequency domain power spectrum estimation methods","channel estimation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Multicarrier OFDM","WiMAX","MIMO","Doppler Channel","Pilots","Channel Estimation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5328068/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-28 Oct. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Simulation of NLOS WiMAX-IEEE 802.16e Physical Layer Using MIMO Doppler Channel Model with Imposed Comb Pilots","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5328068/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"10978520","dateOfInsertion":"17 November 2009","conferenceDate":"27-28 Oct. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Simulation of NLOS WiMAX-IEEE 802.16e Physical Layer Using MIMO Doppler Channel Model with Imposed Comb Pilots","confLoc":"Kottayam, India","sourcePdf":"3845a093.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068701S","chronDate":"27-28 Oct. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5327739","isNumber":"5327740","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5327739","xplore-issue":"5327740","articleId":"5328068","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":5328077,"authors":[{"name":"Hien Nguyen Van","affiliation":["Orange Labs, France"],"firstName":"Hien Nguyen","lastName":"Van","id":"38254932400"},{"name":"Frederic Dang Tran","affiliation":["Orange Labs, Issy-Les-Moulineaux, France"],"firstName":"Frederic Dang","lastName":"Tran","id":"37312358900"},{"name":"Jean-Marc Menaud","affiliation":["Departement Informatique, Ecole des Mines de Nantes / INRIA, LINA, Nantes Cedex 3, France"],"firstName":"Jean-Marc","lastName":"Menaud","id":"37321107500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3836-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5328077","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":121,"citationCountPatent":58,"totalDownloads":1955},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resource management","Virtual machining","Cloud computing","Computer applications","Platform virtualization","Environmental management","Automatic control","Resource virtualization","Cost function","Constraint optimization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["constraint handling","optimisation","quality of service","resource allocation","virtual machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["SLA-aware virtual resource management","virtualization techniques","virtual machines","virtual servers","high-level QoS requirements","autonomic resource manager","constraint programming","optimization"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["resource","virtualization","service","cloud computing"]}],"abstract":"Cloud platforms host several independent applications on a shared resource pool with the ability to allocate computing power to applications on a per-demand basis. The use of server virtualization techniques for such platforms provide great flexibility with the ability to consolidate several virtual machines on the same physical server, to resize a virtual machine capacity and to migrate virtual machine across physical servers. A key challenge for cloud providers is to automate the management of virtual servers while taking into account both high-level QoS requirements of hosted applications and resource management costs. This paper proposes an autonomic resource manager to control the virtualized environment which decouples the provisioning of resources from the dynamic placement of virtual machines. This manager aims to optimize a global utility function which integrates both the degree of SLA fulfillment and the operating costs. We resort to a constraint programming approach to formulate and solve the optimization problem. Results obtained through simulations validate our approach.","doi":"10.1109/CIT.2009.109","publicationTitle":"2009 Ninth IEEE International Conference on Computer and Information Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Ninth IEEE International Conference on Computer and Information Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/5327743/5327744/05328077.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CIT.2009.109","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5327744","startPage":"357","endPage":"362","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"SLA-Aware Virtual Resource Management for Cloud Infrastructures","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5328077","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"SLA-Aware Virtual Resource Management for Cloud Infrastructures","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Oct. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5328077/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"11-14 Oct. 2009","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"10978283","dateOfInsertion":"17 November 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5328077/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SLA-Aware Virtual Resource Management for Cloud Infrastructures","confLoc":"Xiamen, China","sourcePdf":"3836a357.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060577S","chronDate":"11-14 Oct. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5327743","isNumber":"5327744","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5327743","citationCount":"121","xplore-issue":"5327744","articleId":"5328077","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5328092,"authors":[{"name":"D.

Particle swarm optimization (PSO) is a population based optimization technique which has the potentiality to avoid local minima solution which is usually encountered by the traditional block matching algorithms (BMA) such as the three step search (TSS) and the diamond search (DS). To speed up the search, static macro blocks are found in our method, which is particularly beneficial to those video sequences containing small motion contents. Skipping such static macro blocks from processing can save the computation time and memory also. In the proposed method each time we are finding the best matching macro block in two frames at a time so we can reduce the number of error function calculations and it is faster than if we apply PSO technique to find forward motion vector and backward motion vector separately. The proposed method is applied to a number of benchmark video sequences and the results are compared with those obtained by applying the existing methods. Simulation results shows that the proposed algorithms gives the close match of PSNR values when compared to joint search algorithm with DS. Thus, PSO algorithm for Bidirectional motion estimation is empirically given to reduce computational complexity.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-28 Oct. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5328092/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10978573","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5328092/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"17 November 2009","conferenceDate":"27-28 Oct. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"An Efficient Bidirectional Frame Prediction Using Particle Swarm Optimization Technique","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Efficient Bidirectional Frame Prediction Using Particle Swarm Optimization Technique","confLoc":"Kottayam, India","sourcePdf":"3845a042.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067729S","chronDate":"27-28 Oct. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5327739","isNumber":"5327740","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5327739","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"5327740","articleId":"5328092","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":5328132,"authors":[{"name":"Haijun Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Haijun","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37089057640"},{"name":"Tommy W.S.

It is known that when channel state information (CSI) is available at the transmitter a large performance gain can be achieved. In a system employing time-division duplexing (TDD), CSI can be obtained at the base station if there is reciprocity between the forward and reverse channels. In any case, channel estimation errors are inevitable due to the presence of background noise in the estimated signal and due to the finite number of feedback bits used in a limited-rate feedback system model. In this paper, MMSE based precoding technique has been derived by considering channel estimation errors as an integral part of the system design. Simulation results are provided which demonstrate significant performance improvement when compared to the chip-wise linear precoding.","doi":"10.1109/ARTCom.2009.136","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Advances in Recent Technologies in Communication and Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Advances in Recent Technologies in Communication and Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5327739/5327740/05328136.pdf","startPage":"770","endPage":"773","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ARTCom.2009.136","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5327740","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"TDD-CDMA Downlink precoding with Channel Mismatch Error","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5328136","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-28 Oct. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5328136/","displayDocTitle":"TDD-CDMA Downlink precoding with Channel Mismatch Error","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"10978522","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5328136/","conferenceDate":"27-28 Oct. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"17 November 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"TDD-CDMA Downlink precoding with Channel Mismatch Error","confLoc":"Kottayam, India","sourcePdf":"3845a770.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05354S","chronDate":"27-28 Oct. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5327739","isNumber":"5327740","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5327739","xplore-issue":"5327740","articleId":"5328136","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5328144,"authors":[{"name":"Urmila Meshram","affiliation":["RKNEC, Nagpur, India"],"firstName":"Urmila","lastName":"Meshram","id":"37670434100"},{"name":"Pankaj Bande","affiliation":["LARE, Mumbai, India"],"firstName":"Pankaj","lastName":"Bande","id":"37572186700"},{"name":"R.R.

In this paper we propose an image authentication system that remains tolerant to JPEG lossy compression operations. A scheme for JPEG grey scale images is proposed based on a data embedding method that utilizes a secret key and a secret mapping vector in the frequency domain. An encrypted feature vector extracted from the frequency domain, is embedded redundantly, and invisibly in the marked image. On the receiver side, the feature vector from the received image is derived again and compared against the extracted watermark to verify the integrity and authenticity. The proposed scheme is robust against JPEG compression up to a maximum compression of approximately 80%,, but sensitive to malicious attacks such as cutting and pasting. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm has the advantages such as simple computation complexity, security, and good robustness to JPEG compression, and efficient detection of tampering, as well as good tolerance to noise.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Secure Semi-Fragile JPEG Image Authentication Scheme Based on Discrete Cosine Transform","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Computing, Engineering and Information","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2009.58","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Computing, Engineering and Information","pdfPath":"/iel5/5328116/5328117/05328156.pdf","startPage":"285","endPage":"291","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2009.58","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5328117","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5328156","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5328156/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"A Secure Semi-Fragile JPEG Image Authentication Scheme Based on Discrete Cosine Transform","conferenceDate":"2-4 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5328156/","dateOfInsertion":"17 November 2009","publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10978168","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Secure Semi-Fragile JPEG Image Authentication Scheme Based on Discrete Cosine Transform","confLoc":"Fullerton, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"3538a285.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073457S","chronDate":"2-4 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5328116","isNumber":"5328117","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5328116","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5328117","articleId":"5328156","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5328165,"authors":[{"name":"K.

High mobility causes the channel to be fast fading channel. The rapid variation of the channel can induce inter carrier interference (ICI). ICI due to carrier frequency offset can be mitigated by accurate frequency synchronization but ICI due to fast fading channel is more difficult to handle. Thus ICI reduces the throughput and increases the BER. In this paper we proposed an OFDM system which will use variable sub carrier bandwidth (VSB) with variable bit loading (VBL) to minimize the effect of ICI due to high mobility. We investigate the performance of such VSB-VBL OFDM system with fixed sub carrier bandwidth (FSB-OFDM) system based on signal interference to noise ratio (SINR).","doi":"10.1109/ARTCom.2009.160","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Advances in Recent Technologies in Communication and Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Advances in Recent Technologies in Communication and Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5327739/5327740/05328165.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ARTCom.2009.160","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5327740","startPage":"808","endPage":"811","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"SINR Improvement in OFDM Systems Using VSB-VBL Technique for High Mobility Applications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5328165","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"SINR Improvement in OFDM Systems Using VSB-VBL Technique for High Mobility Applications","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-28 Oct. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5328165/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"27-28 Oct. 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"10978533","dateOfInsertion":"17 November 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5328165/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SINR Improvement in OFDM Systems Using VSB-VBL Technique for High Mobility Applications","confLoc":"Kottayam, India","sourcePdf":"3845a808.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066736S","chronDate":"27-28 Oct. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5327739","isNumber":"5327740","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5327739","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5327740","articleId":"5328165","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5328202,"authors":[{"name":"Aaquil Bunglowala","affiliation":["Department of EC Engineering, Sanghvi Institute of Management and Science, Indore, Madhya Pradesh, India"],"firstName":"Aaquil","lastName":"Bunglowala","id":"37670627200"},{"name":"B.M.

Until now, simulated annealing (SA), genetic algorithm (GA) and Hopfield neural network (HNN) were individually used for solving the standard cell placement (SCP) problem. Now, in this paper we discuss systems based on hybridizing HNN, SA and GA. We begin with HNN & GA hybrid system. Here, truncated HNN places 90% cells in 10% computation time followed rest by GA without disturbing the position of already placed cells. We then extend to SA & GA hybrid systems that use either a coupling mechanism or integrating the methods with some features of them to evolve a new method, Parallel Recombinative SA (PRSA) wherein a solution representation is chosen followed by development of cross-over and neighborhood operators. Finally parallelization of PRSA is proposed and taken up. Here the problem is divided into sub-problems and assigned to different processors. For the best computational efficiency, these sub-problems should be least interdependent. In the end we compare them in terms of solution quality and computing speed in connection with the standard cell placement problem followed by comparing the results of the proposed technique with the established results of local search ones such as Tabu search and Threshold accepting.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5328202/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-28 Oct. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"17 November 2009","accessionNumber":"10978534","htmlLink":"/document/5328202/","conferenceDate":"27-28 Oct. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Optimization of Hybrid and Local Search Algorithms for Standard Cell Placement in VLSI Design","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimization of Hybrid and Local Search Algorithms for Standard Cell Placement in VLSI Design","confLoc":"Kottayam, India","sourcePdf":"3845a826.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047209S","chronDate":"27-28 Oct. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5327739","isNumber":"5327740","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5327739","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5327740","articleId":"5328202","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5328387,"authors":[{"name":"Ramalatha M.","firstName":"Ramalatha","lastName":"M."},{"name":"Thanushkodi K.","firstName":"Thanushkodi","lastName":"K."},{"name":"Deena Dayalan K.","firstName":"Deena Dayalan","lastName":"K."},{"name":"Dharani P.","firstName":"Dharani","lastName":"P."}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5104-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-3845-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5328387","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":500},"abstract":"Cubing plays a vital role in secure communication systems, signal processing applications, finite field arithmetic etc. As the radix of the number used for cubing increases the process gets complicated which in turn increases the delay and power consumption.

In this paper the Anurupya Vedic sutra is used for cubing operations with two different multiplier architectures - one array structured and one tree structure.

Stakeholder requirements are usually written in unconstrained natural language, which is inherently imprecise. During system development, problems in stakeholder requirements inevitably propagate to lower levels. This creates unnecessary volatility and risk, which impact programme schedule and cost. Some experts advocate the use of other notations to in-crease precision and minimise problems such as ambiguity. However, use of non-textual notations requires translation of the source requirements, which can introduce further errors. There is also a training overhead associated with the introduction of new notations. A small set of structural rules was developed to address eight common requirement problems including ambiguity, complexity and vagueness. The ruleset allows all natural language requirements to be expressed in one of five simple templates. The ruleset was applied whilst extracting aero engine control system requirements from an airworthiness regulation document. The results of this case study show qualitative and quantitative improvements compared with a conventional textual requirements specification.","doi":"10.1109/RE.2009.9","publicationTitle":"2009 17th IEEE International Requirements Engineering Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 17th IEEE International Requirements Engineering Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5328459/5328460/05328509.pdf","startPage":"317","endPage":"322","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RE.2009.9","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5328460","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Easy Approach to Requirements Syntax (EARS)","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5328509","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 31 2009-Sept. 4 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5328509/","displayDocTitle":"Easy Approach to Requirements Syntax (EARS)","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","accessionNumber":"10977837","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5328509/","conferenceDate":"31 Aug.-4 Sept. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"17 November 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Easy Approach to Requirements Syntax (EARS)","confLoc":"Atlanta, GA, USA","sourcePdf":"3761a317.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050046S","chronDate":"Aug. 31 2009-Sept. 4 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5328459","isNumber":"5328460","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5328459","citationCount":"109","xplore-issue":"5328460","articleId":"5328509","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-18"},{"_id":5328545,"authors":[{"name":"E.

Effectiveness of a March test is usually decided by the number of faults that can be detected using the test. The more the number of fault models covered, the better the test. March tests with good fault coverage have been developed but the test power also plays an important role in deciding the effectiveness of the test. The test power is directly related to the number of switching activities occurring in the test. The paper deals with the generation of March tests with low test power and good fault coverage by test sequence reordering using a genetic algorithm based approach. A power tool has been developed helps us to calculate the power consumption of a given March test. An algorithm was devised to generate new march tests with optimized test power and fault coverage by reordering the test sequence. The fault coverage and diagnostic capabilities of the novel March test can be verified using the fault simulator tool developed. The use of genetic algorithm helps to generate wide range of test patterns compared to the existing methods.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-28 Oct. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5328940/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10978590","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5328940/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"17 November 2009","conferenceDate":"27-28 Oct. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Generation of New March Tests with Low Test Power and High Fault Coverage by Test Sequence Reordering Using Genetic Algorithm","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Generation of New March Tests with Low Test Power and High Fault Coverage by Test Sequence Reordering Using Genetic Algorithm","confLoc":"Kottayam, India","sourcePdf":"3845a699.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.083933S","chronDate":"27-28 Oct. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5327739","isNumber":"5327740","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5327739","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5327740","articleId":"5328940","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5328948,"authors":[{"name":"Hatim A.

Popular approaches for face recognition, such as principal components analysis (PCA), rely on static datasets where training is carried in a batch-mode on a pre-available image set. Real world applications require that the training set be dynamic of evolving nature where within the framework of continuous learning new training images are continuously added to the original set; this would trigger a costly frequent re-computation of the eigen space representation via repeating an entire batch-based training that includes the new images. Incremental PCA methods allow adding new images and updating the PCA representation, and offer the advantage of dispensing with the recently added images after model update. In this paper, various incremental PCA (IPCA) training and relearning strategies are proposed and applied to the candid covariance-free incremental principal component algorithm. The effect of the number of increments and size of the eigen vectors on the correct rate of recognition are studied. The results suggest that batch PCA is inferior to the four considered IPCA1-4, and that all IPCAs are practically equivalent with IPCA3 yielding slightly better results than the other IPCAs.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2009.56","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Computing, Engineering and Information","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Computing, Engineering and Information","pdfPath":"/iel5/5328116/5328117/05328948.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2009.56","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5328117","startPage":"39","endPage":"43","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Face Recognition Using Incremental Principal Components Analysis","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5328948","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Face Recognition Using Incremental Principal Components Analysis","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 April 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5328948/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"2-4 April 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10978200","dateOfInsertion":"17 November 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5328948/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Face Recognition Using Incremental Principal Components Analysis","confLoc":"Fullerton, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"3538a039.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060622S","chronDate":"2-4 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5328116","isNumber":"5328117","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5328116","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5328117","articleId":"5328948","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5328987,"authors":[{"name":"Rambabu Tadisetti","affiliation":["Electronics and Communication Department, Rao and Naidu Engineering College, Ongole, Andhra Pradesh, INDIA"],"firstName":"Rambabu","lastName":"Tadisetti","id":"37086904007"},{"name":"P.

A blind equalization index is presented for the purpose of selecting the best equalizer.

The sensor networks can be used for various application areas (e.g., health, military, home). Wireless Sensor Networks are autonomous devices forwarding locally collected data to a so-called sink node along multi-hop wireless paths. The main con-straint is the limited (battery) power. WSN are usually deployed in very harsh environment where node failure occurs frequently. The network should be resilient to node failure and should give long life which is of the order of 1-2 year with single charge.

This problem becomes more complex when the hydro plants are in the cascade pattern. The scheduling of cascaded hydro system should be in such way that water discharge from upstream plant can be effectively utilized at downstream plant satisfying all operational constraints. Particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm has successfully applied for such problems. Most of the existing improved Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithms have been suffered from premature convergence. To overcome this problem, New Self Adaptive Inertia Weight Swarm Optimization (NSAIW_PSO) with special function is adopted for scheduling of hydro power plants in this paper. This approach is applied on a real operated cascaded hydroelectric system located in state Madhya Pradesh, India. The results from presented approach are critically compared with that of Linearly Decreasing Inertia Weight (LDIW_PSO) method and found to give better solution.","doi":"10.1109/ARTCom.2009.220","startPage":"565","endPage":"570","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Advances in Recent Technologies in Communication and Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5327739/5327740/05329134.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Advances in Recent Technologies in Communication and Computing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ARTCom.2009.220","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5327740","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Scheduling of Cascaded Hydro Power System: A New Self Adaptive Inertia Weight Particle Swarm Optimization Approach","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power systems","Particle swarm optimization","Hydroelectric power generation","Job shop scheduling","Power generation","Water resources","Power generation economics","Hydraulic turbines","Ant colony optimization","Communications technology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hydroelectric power stations","particle swarm optimisation","power generation scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cascaded hydro power system","self adaptive inertia weight particle swarm optimization","hydro power plant scheduling"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Hydroelectric power generation","new self adaptive inertia weight","linearly decreasing inertia weight","generation scheduling"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5329134/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-28 Oct. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Scheduling of Cascaded Hydro Power System: A New Self Adaptive Inertia Weight Particle Swarm Optimization Approach","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5329134/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"17 November 2009","conferenceDate":"27-28 Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"10978452","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Scheduling of Cascaded Hydro Power System: A New Self Adaptive Inertia Weight Particle Swarm Optimization Approach","confLoc":"Kottayam, India","sourcePdf":"3845a565.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.104114S","chronDate":"27-28 Oct. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5327739","isNumber":"5327740","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5327739","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5327740","articleId":"5329134","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5329156,"authors":[{"name":"Shital Tak","affiliation":["Electronics and Telecommunication, Sinhgad College of Engineering, Pune, India"],"firstName":"Shital","lastName":"Tak","id":"37573337300"},{"name":"Madan Mali","affiliation":["Electronics and Telecommunication, Sinhgad College of Engineering, Pune, India"],"firstName":"Madan","lastName":"Mali","id":"37567974600"},{"name":"Mukul Sutaone","affiliation":["Electronics and Telecommunication, College of Engineering, Pune, India"],"firstName":"Mukul","lastName":"Sutaone","id":"37568550800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5104-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-3845-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5329156","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":125},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Random access memory","Mathematical model","Fault tolerance","Educational institutions","Design engineering","Power engineering and energy","Logic","Books","Image processing","Power dissipation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cache storage","embedded systems","fault tolerance","high-speed integrated circuits","integrated circuit design","low-power electronics","SPICE","SRAM chips"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low power rhythmic SRAM","cache SRAM design","embedded systems","image processing","high speed SRAM array","fault tolerant codebook","SPICE","successive multiple read cycles","vector quantizer","bit rate 5 Gbit/s","voltage 300 mV","storage capacity 256 bit","size 0.25 mum","voltage 600 mV","power 1.8 mW","voltage 1.25 V","voltage 2.5 V"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["SRAM","Bit Lines","Word Lines","Vector Quantizer","Code Book"]}],"abstract":"Effective design of cache SRAM has always been the challenging task in embedded systems dedicated to image processing applications such as vector quantizer (VQ).

We have analyzed the emotional speech corpus recorded by using both Discrete Wavelet Transforms (DWTs) and Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) and obtained an overall recognition accuracy of 68.5% and 55% respectively. artificial neural network was used for the classification and recognition purpose.","doi":"10.1109/ARTCom.2009.231","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Advances in Recent Technologies in Communication and Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Advances in Recent Technologies in Communication and Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5327739/5327740/05329196.pdf","startPage":"528","endPage":"531","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ARTCom.2009.231","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5327740","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Speaker Independent Automatic Emotion Recognition from Speech: A Comparison of MFCCs and Discrete Wavelet Transforms","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5329196","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-28 Oct. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5329196/","displayDocTitle":"Speaker Independent Automatic Emotion Recognition from Speech: A Comparison of MFCCs and Discrete Wavelet Transforms","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"10978619","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5329196/","conferenceDate":"27-28 Oct. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"17 November 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Speaker Independent Automatic Emotion Recognition from Speech: A Comparison of MFCCs and Discrete Wavelet Transforms","confLoc":"Kottayam, India","sourcePdf":"3845a528.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.107834S","chronDate":"27-28 Oct. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5327739","isNumber":"5327740","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5327739","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5327740","articleId":"5329196","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5329284,"authors":[{"name":"Jae-Kark Choi","affiliation":["Graduate School of Information Technology & Telecommunications, Inha University, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jae-Kark","lastName":"Choi","id":"37405963900"},{"name":"Ki-Hyuk Kwon","affiliation":["Graduate School of Information Technology & Telecommunications, Inha University, South Korea"],"firstName":"Ki-Hyuk","lastName":"Kwon","id":"37674315200"},{"name":"Sang-Jo Yoo","affiliation":["Graduate School of Information Technology & Telecommunications, Inha University, South Korea"],"firstName":"Sang-Jo","lastName":"Yoo","id":"37403379000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3836-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5329284","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":127},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cognitive radio","Quality of service","Protection","Chromium","Mobile communication","Wireless LAN","Scheduling","Information technology","Interference","Proposals"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","interference (signal)","quality of service","scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel sensing","scheduling","cognitive radio networks","flexible spectrum utilization","interference","quality of service","QoS"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["cognitive radio (CR)","channel sensing","sensing scheduling","QoS-aware sensing"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5329284","doi":"10.1109/CIT.2009.115","publicationTitle":"2009 Ninth IEEE International Conference on Computer and Information Technology","abstract":"Cognitive radio (CR) has been considered as the most prominent technique for flexible spectrum utilization. Protecting primary users (PUs) from any harmful interference is the most important issue in CR networks. Secondary users (SUs) periodically sense the channels in order to detect the PU's appearance. Without a proper sensing schedule, however, sensing operation may degrade the quality of service (QoS) of SUs. In this paper, we propose the channel sensing scheduling that protects PUs by sensing the channels with a proper sensing interval as well as maintains the QoS of SUs as possible. Channel sensing intervals required for protecting PUs and sensing cycle required for guaranteeing QoS of SUs are numerically formulated. We show that our proposal outperforms the consecutive channel sensing method in terms of delay and packet loss.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CIT.2009.115","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5328992","startPage":"63","endPage":"68","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Ninth IEEE International Conference on Computer and Information Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/5327743/5328992/05329284.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"QoS-Aware Channel Sensing Scheduling in Cognitive Radio Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5329284/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Oct. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5329284/","displayDocTitle":"QoS-Aware Channel Sensing Scheduling in Cognitive Radio Networks","conferenceDate":"11-14 Oct. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"10978362","dateOfInsertion":"17 November 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"2","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"QoS-Aware Channel Sensing Scheduling in Cognitive Radio Networks","confLoc":"Xiamen, China","sourcePdf":"3836b063.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054789S","chronDate":"11-14 Oct. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5327743","isNumber":"5328992","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5327743","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"5328992","articleId":"5329284","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5329312,"authors":[{"name":"Nan Hao","affiliation":["Graduate school of Information Technology &Telecommunications, Inha University, Incheon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Nan","lastName":"Hao","id":"37410380600"},{"name":"Hai-Hua Du","affiliation":["Graduate school of Information Technology &Telecommunications, Inha University, Incheon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Hai-Hua","lastName":"Du","id":"37667596700"},{"name":"Sang-Jo Yoo","affiliation":["Graduate school of Information Technology &Telecommunications, Inha University, Incheon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Sang-Jo","lastName":"Yoo","id":"37403379000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3836-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5329312","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":145},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wireless sensor networks","Synchronization","Iterative algorithms","Timing","Clocks","Delay estimation","Capacitive sensors","Data communication","Information processing","Iterative methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["iterative methods","radio direction-finding","synchronisation","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wireless sensor networks","wireless data transmission","data sinking","information processing","iterative positioning algorithm-time synchronization","IPATS algorithm","clock skews","position estimation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["localization","iterative","position estimation","wireless sensor network"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5329312","doi":"10.1109/CIT.2009.116","publicationTitle":"2009 Ninth IEEE International Conference on Computer and Information Technology","abstract":"Recently, the sensor network that combines the wireless data transmission, data sinking, and information processing capacities, is a gathering more and more attentions. With the development of research on wireless sensor networks, localization-the determination of the absolute or relative position of sensor nodes is becoming an essential research issue. In this paper, we propose an iterative positioning algorithm with time synchronization (IPATS) which can enhance the positioning accuracy in wireless sensor networks. In the IPATS algorithm, we propose a new iterative distance measurement method that adapts timing synchronization information and previous ranging error. To adjust the clock skew and to compensate random delay on the signal propagation that is the main reasons of inaccurate timing synchronization and position estimation, we define a calibration parameter. Iterative corrections of positioning errors and clock differences enhance the positioning accuracy. Simulation results show that the positioning accuracy of the proposed algorithm is superior to the previous TDOA and OCLA algorithm.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CIT.2009.116","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5328992","startPage":"52","endPage":"57","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Ninth IEEE International Conference on Computer and Information Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/5327743/5328992/05329312.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Iterative Wireless Sensor Network Positioning Based on Time Synchronization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5329312/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Oct. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5329312/","displayDocTitle":"Iterative Wireless Sensor Network Positioning Based on Time Synchronization","conferenceDate":"11-14 Oct. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"10978341","dateOfInsertion":"17 November 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"2","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Iterative Wireless Sensor Network Positioning Based on Time Synchronization","confLoc":"Xiamen, China","sourcePdf":"3836b052.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060982S","chronDate":"11-14 Oct. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5327743","isNumber":"5328992","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5327743","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5328992","articleId":"5329312","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5329329,"authors":[{"name":"A.

Obstacles of different shapes (convex, concave and curved) with varying velocities are considered. The method uses only valid particles (feasible paths form start to target without interfering obstacles) in the population, obviating the need to search the invalid particles and hence penalty function evaluation design, as in earlier evolutionary approaches. The generated valid paths are subjected to PSO algorithm to get global optimal paths. The proposed algorithm also gives the velocity of the robot for each path segment depending upon the path length and or travel time optimization. The effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated by simulation studies.","doi":"10.1109/ARTCom.2009.24","pdfPath":"/iel5/5327739/5327740/05329373.pdf","startPage":"401","endPage":"405","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Advances in Recent Technologies in Communication and Computing","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Advances in Recent Technologies in Communication and Computing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ARTCom.2009.24","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5327740","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Path Planning for Mobile Robots in Dynamic Environments Using Particle Swarm Optimization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5329373/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-28 Oct. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Path Planning for Mobile Robots in Dynamic Environments Using Particle Swarm Optimization","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"17 November 2009","accessionNumber":"10978428","publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5329373/","conferenceDate":"27-28 Oct. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Path Planning for Mobile Robots in Dynamic Environments Using Particle Swarm Optimization","confLoc":"Kottayam, India","sourcePdf":"3845a401.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052567S","chronDate":"27-28 Oct. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5327739","isNumber":"5327740","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5327739","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"5327740","articleId":"5329373","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-07"},{"_id":5329400,"authors":[{"name":"Krishna Kumar S.","firstName":"Krishna Kumar","lastName":"S.","id":"37085704300"},{"name":"Uday Bhaskar P.","firstName":"Uday Bhaskar","lastName":"P.","id":"37085936760"},{"name":"Santanu Chattopadhyay","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Electrical Communication Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur, Kharagpur, India"],"firstName":"Santanu","lastName":"Chattopadhyay","id":"37277128800"},{"name":"Pradip Mandal","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Electrical Communication Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur, Kharagpur, India"],"firstName":"Pradip","lastName":"Mandal","id":"37269997100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5104-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-3845-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5329400","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":156},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5329400","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Circuit testing","Particle swarm optimization","Electronic equipment testing","Test pattern generators","Electrical fault detection","Fault detection","Circuit faults","Combinational circuits","Communications technology","Benchmark testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["circuit optimisation","combinational circuits","computational complexity","integrated circuit testing","logic partitioning","particle swarm optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["circuit partitioning","particle swarm optimization","pseudoexhaustive testing","digital IC","NP-complete problem","heuristic solution","combinational benchmark circuits","PIFAN"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Pseudo-exhaustive testing","swap operator","cones","dependency","particle swarm optimization"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ARTCom.2009.145","pdfPath":"/iel5/5327739/5327740/05329400.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Advances in Recent Technologies in Communication and Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Advances in Recent Technologies in Communication and Computing","startPage":"346","endPage":"350","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5327740","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ARTCom.2009.145","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Circuit Partitioning Using Particle Swarm Optimization for Pseudo-Exhaustive Testing","abstract":"Pseudo-exhaustive testing reduces the size of test set and test application time compared to exhaustive testing, by partitioning the circuit into cones with lesser number of dependency and exercising each cone with all possible input patterns. This implies that the circuit with large number of inputs should be efficiently partitioned into cones having manageable number of inputs. Partitioning problem is NP-complete and effective heuristic solutions have been proposed in the past. In this paper, we present an approach based on Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), for circuit partitioning. PSO is based on the iterative use of a set of particles that correspond to states in an optimization problem, moving each agent in a numerical space looking for the optimal position. Experiments on combinational benchmark circuits validate the effectiveness of our work. Our approach shows an improvement of 25% over another PSO based partitioning approach published in [15]. Over PIFAN [16] and I-PIFAN [14] our approach gave a maximum of 72% and 56% improvement, respectively.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-28 Oct. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5329400/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10978585","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5329400/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"17 November 2009","conferenceDate":"27-28 Oct. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Circuit Partitioning Using Particle Swarm Optimization for Pseudo-Exhaustive Testing","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Circuit Partitioning Using Particle Swarm Optimization for Pseudo-Exhaustive Testing","confLoc":"Kottayam, India","sourcePdf":"3845a346.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069628S","chronDate":"27-28 Oct. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5327739","isNumber":"5327740","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5327739","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5327740","articleId":"5329400","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":5329415,"authors":[{"name":"Mallika K.","affiliation":["Computational Engineering and Networking Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham, Coimbatore, India"],"firstName":"Mallika","lastName":"K.","id":"37085936089"},{"name":"Soman K.P.","affiliation":["Computational Engineering and Networking Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham, Coimbatore, India"],"firstName":"Soman","lastName":"K.P.","id":"37085911338"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5104-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-3845-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5329415","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":68},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image fusion","Wavelet transforms","Discrete wavelet transforms","Filter bank","Spatial resolution","Wavelet analysis","Computer networks","Frequency","Signal resolution","Communications technology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discrete wavelet transforms","image colour analysis","image fusion"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image fusion","overcomplete rational wavelet transform","improved IHS method","fast intensity-hue-saturation","discrete wavelet transform","rational dilation factor","hybrid fusion","panchromatic image","intensity image"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Pan-sharpening","Intensity-Hue-Saturation transform","Wavelet transforms","frames","filter bank","rational dilation factors"]}],"abstract":"This paper introduces a new hybrid fusion method which is comprised of fast intensity-hue-saturation (FIHS) and over complete discrete wavelet transform with rational dilation factors.

One of the key features is the intra prediction based on the rate distortion optimization (RDO) procedure, which requires a true encoding of the intra block by trying all intra prediction modes. The computational burden of intra prediction with the RDO procedure is extremely high for real time applications. In this paper, we propose a classified block type (CBT) algorithm that selects the appropriate intra block size and further our proposed subblock based direction detection (SDD) algorithm processes the selected block that reduces a number of candidate mode required for RDO which significantly reduces the encoder complexity. Experimental results show that the proposed fast mode decision algorithm reduces the encoding time by about 68%, with negligible loss of video quality.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Oct. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5329435/","isConference":true,"volume":"1","accessionNumber":"10978291","publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","conferenceDate":"11-14 Oct. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5329435/","dateOfInsertion":"17 November 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Efficient Fast Intra Mode Decision and Classified Block Type Algorithms for H.264/AVC Encoder","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient Fast Intra Mode Decision and Classified Block Type Algorithms for H.264/AVC Encoder","confLoc":"Xiamen, China","sourcePdf":"3836a172.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.082555S","chronDate":"11-14 Oct. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5327743","isNumber":"5327744","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5327743","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5327744","articleId":"5329435","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5329487,"authors":[{"name":"P.N.

However, many of these anomaly detection systems have low detection accuracy when the training is not sufficient. This occurs because the normal behavior data obtained through training on one machine cannot be used for detection on another machine. In this paper, we propose an anomaly detection system that shares normal behavior data between multiple machines. In the proposed system, normal behavior data obtained on each machine is accumulated in a server and the integrated data is distributed to each machine.This system improves the detection accuracy by integrating the data used for anomaly detection on each machine. The proposed system not only provides a straightforward algorithm for integration, but also two improved algorithms, namely, the majority algorithm and the similarity algorithm.

The design problem is formulated as an Eigen value based Optimization problem and the PSS parameters are optimized to shift the system electromechanical modes of oscillations at different loading conditions to the left in the complex s- plane for stability. To show the robustness of the proposed controller, Non linear simulations have been carried out under various operating conditions of the system operation. The Novel feature of this paper is the Computation of Eigen values, its analysis and comparative study of the system model between Conventional Lead lag stabilizer and the PSO based PSS.","doi":"10.1109/ARTCom.2009.213","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Advances in Recent Technologies in Communication and Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Advances in Recent Technologies in Communication and Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5327739/5327740/05329503.pdf","startPage":"260","endPage":"262","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ARTCom.2009.213","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5327740","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Innovative Bio Inspired PSO Algorithm to Enhance Power System Oscillations Damping","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5329503","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-28 Oct. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5329503/","displayDocTitle":"An Innovative Bio Inspired PSO Algorithm to Enhance Power System Oscillations Damping","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"10978595","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5329503/","conferenceDate":"27-28 Oct. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"17 November 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Innovative Bio Inspired PSO Algorithm to Enhance Power System Oscillations Damping","confLoc":"Kottayam, India","sourcePdf":"3845a260.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.035759S","chronDate":"27-28 Oct. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5327739","isNumber":"5327740","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5327739","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5327740","articleId":"5329503","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5329547,"authors":[{"name":"Sabine Helwig","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Erlangen Nuremberg, Germany"],"firstName":"Sabine","lastName":"Helwig","id":"37565886500"},{"name":"Frank Neumann","affiliation":["Max Planck Institut f\u00fcr Informatik, Saarbruecken, Germany"],"firstName":"Frank","lastName":"Neumann","id":"37275783100"},{"name":"Rolf Wanka","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Erlangen Nuremberg, Germany"],"firstName":"Rolf","lastName":"Wanka","id":"37370313700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3827-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5329547","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":206},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5329547","abstract":"Particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithms have gained increasing interest for dealing with continuous optimization problems in recent years. Often such problems involve boundary constraints. In this case, one has to cope with the situation that particles may leave the feasible search space. To deal with such situations different bound handling methods have been proposed in the literature and it has been observed that the success of PSO algorithms depends on a large degree on the used bound handling method. In this paper, we propose an alternative approach to cope with bounded search spaces. The idea is to introduce a velocity adaptation mechanism into PSO algorithms that is similar to step size adaptation used in evolution strategies. Using this approach we show that the bound handling method becomes less important for PSO algorithms and that using velocity adaptation leads to better results for a wide range of benchmark functions.","doi":"10.1109/ICAIS.2009.32","startPage":"146","endPage":"151","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Adaptive and Intelligent Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5327746/5327747/05329547.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Adaptive and Intelligent Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICAIS.2009.32","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5327747","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Particle Swarm Optimization with Velocity Adaptation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Particle swarm optimization","Stochastic processes","Adaptive systems","Intelligent systems","Computer science","Birds","Marine animals","Educational institutions","Humans","Upper bound"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["particle swarm optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["velocity adaptation","bound handling methods","bounded search spaces","velocity adaptation mechanism","particle swarm optimization algorithms","step size adaptation","evolution strategies"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Particle swarm optimization","velocity adaptation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5329547/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 Sept. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Particle Swarm Optimization with Velocity Adaptation","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5329547/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"17 November 2009","conferenceDate":"24-26 Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"11046319","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Particle Swarm Optimization with Velocity Adaptation","confLoc":"Klagenfurt, Austria","sourcePdf":"3827a146.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051761S","chronDate":"24-26 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5327746","isNumber":"5327747","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5327746","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"5327747","articleId":"5329547","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5329798,"authors":[{"name":"Shruti Oza","affiliation":["EC Department, Kalol Institute of Technology and Research Centre, Kalol, India"],"firstName":"Shruti","lastName":"Oza","id":"37540868000"},{"name":"N.M.

The folding amplifier can be used to produce more than one zero-crossing point to reduce required number of comparators. This paper presents simple low voltage, low power folding amplifier with folding factor=4 for folding and interpolating ADC. The design is implemented using 0.13 um technology at 1.5 V supply voltage. The simulation results are compared with voltage mode (conventional differential pair based) folding amplifier and current steering folding amplifier. In order to achieve low power, glitches are reduced.
