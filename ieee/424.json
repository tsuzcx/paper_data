We extend the potential of a content-based image retrieval (CBIR) system based on Self- Organizing Maps (SOMs), to the analysis of remote sensing data. A database was artificially created by splitting each satellite image to be analyzed into small images. After training the CBIR system on this imagelet database, both interactive and off-line queries were made to detect man-made structures, as well as changes. Experimental results suggest that this new approach is suitable for analyzing very high-resolution optical satellite imagery. Possible applications include interactive detection of man-made structures and supervised monitoring of sensitive sites.","doi":"10.1109/IGARSS.2006.5","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Symposium on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IGARSS.2006.5","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4241146","pdfPath":"/iel5/4087812/4241146/04241152.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Symposium on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image analysis","Information retrieval","Image retrieval","Content based retrieval","Image databases","Organizing","Remote sensing","Artificial satellites","Optical sensors","Monitoring"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["geophysical techniques","remote sensing","self-organising feature maps"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["self organizing map","man-made structures detection","satellite imagery","content based querying","image retrieval","remote sensing"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A Self-Organizing Map Framework for Detection of Man-Made Structures and Changes in Satellite Imagery","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4241152/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4241152/","accessionNumber":"10251848","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"18 June 2007","publicationDate":"July 2006","conferenceDate":"31 July-4 Aug. 2006","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"July 31 2006-Aug. 4 2006","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Self-Organizing Map Framework for Detection of Man-Made Structures and Changes in Satellite Imagery","confLoc":"Denver, CO, USA","sourcePdf":"01_01P01.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.033475S","chronDate":"July 31 2006-Aug. 4 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4087812","isNumber":"4241146","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4087812","xplore-issue":"4241146","articleId":"4241152","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4241182,"authors":[{"name":"P.

Implementation of this technology requires knowledge of the location and density of weed species within a crop. In this study, two image classification techniques (neural networks and maximum likelihood) are compared for accuracy in weed/crop species discrimination. In the summer of 2005, high spatial resolution (1.25 mm) ground-based hyperspectral image data were acquired over field plots of three crop species (canola, peas, and wheat) seeded with weeds, either redroot pigweed or wild oat. Neural network (NN) and maximum likelihood (MLC) classifiers were applied to these image data for comparison of accuracy in species discrimination. Both techniques preformed well in classifying single weed/crop mixtures with overall accuracies ranging from 92-97% and 88-96% using NN and MLC, respectively. NN classification accuracy showed slight improvements over MLC in all cases.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"July 31 2006-Aug. 4 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4241182/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10251876","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4241182/","publicationDate":"July 2006","dateOfInsertion":"18 June 2007","conferenceDate":"31 July-4 Aug. 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Comparison of Neural Network and Maximum Likelihood High Resolution Image Classification for Weed Detection in Crops: Applications in Precision Agriculture","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparison of Neural Network and Maximum Likelihood High Resolution Image Classification for Weed Detection in Crops: Applications in Precision Agriculture","confLoc":"Denver, CO, USA","sourcePdf":"01_06P03.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058825S","chronDate":"July 31 2006-Aug. 4 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4087812","isNumber":"4241146","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4087812","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4241146","articleId":"4241182","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4241186,"authors":[{"name":"J.

This radar is integrated into under-wings pods that are fixed on a STEMME S10VT motorglider. This radar concept combines real aperture in the cross-track direction, by the antennas geometrical aperture, and synthetic aperture in the along-track direction, realized with the aircraft motion. Radar front-end uses FMCW (for Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave) technique which allows to reduce the power emission to a few Watts. In addition, the use of the millimeter band induces antennas size reduction, and makes possible the radar integration into pods. Thus, radar particularities are a low- size, a low-weight and a low-cost basis, making this radar suitable for future integration on board small vehicles, such as UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle). The radar definition and specifications will be exposed, together with the first results obtained on April 2006. Two ways of operation will be exposed: An application as vertical sounder, using cylindrical horn antennas, and an application as SAR radar, using rectangular antennas. The two cases will be illustrated by samples of results.","doi":"10.1109/IGARSS.2006.39","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Symposium on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Symposium on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4087812/4241146/04241186.pdf","startPage":"134","endPage":"136","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IGARSS.2006.39","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4241146","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Ka Band Imaging Radar: DRIVE on Board ONERA Motorglider","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4241186","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"July 31 2006-Aug. 4 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4241186/","displayDocTitle":"A Ka Band Imaging Radar: DRIVE on Board ONERA Motorglider","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2006","accessionNumber":"10251880","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4241186/","conferenceDate":"31 July-4 Aug. 2006","dateOfInsertion":"18 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Ka Band Imaging Radar: DRIVE on Board ONERA Motorglider","confLoc":"Denver, CO, USA","sourcePdf":"01_08P01.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.036092S","chronDate":"July 31 2006-Aug. 4 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4087812","isNumber":"4241146","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4087812","citationCount":"40","xplore-issue":"4241146","articleId":"4241186","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4241243,"authors":[{"name":"C.

More recently, we have further improved the scaling of the approach [2], making it a practical method for large-scale hyperspectral scenes. The new method extracts a set of data manifold coordinates that directly parameterize nonlinearities present in hyperspectral imagery, both on land and in the water column. In the water column, this is particularly important because of the nonlinear, attenuating properties of the medium. In this paper, we model hyperspectral imagery acquired by the NRL PHILLS [5] at the Indian River Lagoon, Florida in July 2004. In our previous efforts [3] using a small subset of data derived from the surf zone outside of the lagoon, dominant manifold coordinates were shown to parameterize bathymetry directly with a high degree of correlation to a radiative transfer look-up table (LUT) approach. In the present work, we construct a full scene manifold coordinate representation and use this as the basis of a LUT for samples with known depths as determined by the SHOALS LIDAR. Sequestered test data presented to the manifold based LUT yield a mean estimated depth which differs from the LOAR retrieved depth by less than 0.44 m for depths between 0-10 m with a standard deviation less than 1.2 m.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IGARSS.2006.96","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4241146","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Symposium on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Symposium on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4087812/4241146/04241243.pdf","endPage":"359","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modeling Coastal Waters from Hyperspectral Imagery using Manifold Coordinates","doi":"10.1109/IGARSS.2006.96","startPage":"356","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4241243","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"July 31 2006-Aug. 4 2006","displayDocTitle":"Modeling Coastal Waters from Hyperspectral Imagery using Manifold Coordinates","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4241243/","dateOfInsertion":"18 June 2007","accessionNumber":"10265005","publicationDate":"July 2006","htmlLink":"/document/4241243/","conferenceDate":"31 July-4 Aug. 2006","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modeling Coastal Waters from Hyperspectral Imagery using Manifold Coordinates","confLoc":"Denver, CO, USA","sourcePdf":"02_05A02.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067279S","chronDate":"July 31 2006-Aug. 4 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4087812","isNumber":"4241146","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4087812","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4241146","articleId":"4241243","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4241250,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Each algorithm exploits correlation between bands by enforcing simultaneous sparsity on their wavelet representations. This is done in a non-linear manner using wavelet decompositions and sparse approximation techniques. The first algorithm denoises an entire cube of data. Our experiments show that it outperforms wavelet-based global soft thresholding techniques in both a mean-square error (MSE) and a qualitative visual sense. The second algorithm denoises a set of noisy, user designated bands (\"junk bands\") by exploiting correlated information from higher quality bands within the same cube. We prove the utility of our junk band denoising algorithm by denoising ten bands of actual AVIRIS data by a significant amount. Preprocessing data cubes with these algorithms is likely to increase the performance of classifiers that make use of hyperspectral data, especially if the denoised and/or recovered bands contain spectral features useful for discriminating between classes.","doi":"10.1109/IGARSS.2006.104","pdfPath":"/iel5/4087812/4241146/04241251.pdf","startPage":"387","endPage":"390","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Symposium on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Symposium on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IGARSS.2006.104","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4241146","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Denoising Hyperspectral Imagery and Recovering Junk Bands using Wavelets and Sparse Approximation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4241251/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July 31 2006-Aug. 4 2006","displayDocTitle":"Denoising Hyperspectral Imagery and Recovering Junk Bands using Wavelets and Sparse Approximation","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"18 June 2007","accessionNumber":"10265010","publicationDate":"July 2006","htmlLink":"/document/4241251/","conferenceDate":"31 July-4 Aug. 2006","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Denoising Hyperspectral Imagery and Recovering Junk Bands using Wavelets and Sparse Approximation","confLoc":"Denver, CO, USA","sourcePdf":"02_06A03.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075615S","chronDate":"July 31 2006-Aug. 4 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4087812","isNumber":"4241146","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4087812","citationCount":"37","xplore-issue":"4241146","articleId":"4241251","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":4241257,"authors":[{"name":"E.

The algorithms developed by CRPSM to estimate, in an as automatic as possible way, the refugee camps population (tents) are based on the mathematical morphology (MM). The method has been applied to Ikonos and Quickbird VHSR images of several refugee camps (Goz Amer, Mille, Lukole, etc) located in Africa, to solve the tents counting problem. The error associated with these techniques, computed comparing the number of tents detected by the different algorithms with the one obtained by a visual counting, results satisfactorily low.

Due to different sensor characteristics, the NDVI values vary according to the recording system. This study focuses on the factor of spectral sensor characteristics, which can complicate the interpretation of multisensoral NDVI data. Therefore, multispectral bands of Landsat 5TM, QuickBird and SPOT5 were simulated from hyperspectral data. These simulated data sets show identical characteristics (except spectrally) like sensor geometry, atmospheric conditions, topography and spatial resolution. This allows a direct comparison of NDVI differences caused by the factor of different spectral characteristics. The results show substantial NDVI differences with a systematic nonlinear offset between the sensor systems, solely caused by different relative spectral response functions of the sensor bands. Thus, a step-by-step sensor intercalibration is desirable, which first takes the spectral characteristics into account, because this NDVI-differences causing factor is clearly determinable against others.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IGARSS.2006.294","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4241146","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Symposium on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Symposium on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4087812/4241146/04241441.pdf","endPage":"1141","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Assessment of NDVI- Differences Caused by Sensor Specific Relative Spectral Response Functions","doi":"10.1109/IGARSS.2006.294","startPage":"1138","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4241441","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"July 31 2006-Aug. 4 2006","displayDocTitle":"Assessment of NDVI- Differences Caused by Sensor Specific Relative Spectral Response Functions","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4241441/","dateOfInsertion":"18 June 2007","accessionNumber":"10265125","publicationDate":"July 2006","htmlLink":"/document/4241441/","conferenceDate":"31 July-4 Aug. 2006","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Assessment of NDVI- Differences Caused by Sensor Specific Relative Spectral Response Functions","confLoc":"Denver, CO, USA","sourcePdf":"02_29A01.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.033546S","chronDate":"July 31 2006-Aug. 4 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4087812","isNumber":"4241146","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4087812","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"4241146","articleId":"4241441","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4241465,"authors":[{"name":"W.

In order to detect such anomalies in an image, the classes associated with the background have to be known. A computationally efficient methodology to determine the background pure classes present in a low resolution hyperspectral image has been previously proposed by the authors. The method is based on robust clustering using a small percentage of the image pixels as input. The clusters are obtained using a self organising map (SOM) clustered using the local minima of the U-matrix (distance matrix). In this paper, we provide a statistical study and evaluation of the proposed approach using simulated and real hyperspectral images.

Ground- based radiometers operating at 37, 16.5 and 1 GHz (vertical and horizontal polarization) were used. The ground was partially covered with aluminum sheets, allowing measurement of both snow-covered ground (incidence angle 30 to 60 degrees) and snow only (10 degrees). Detailed ground truth data concerning snow, soil and weather were collected. In order to obtain layered dielectric and extinction information on snow in the test site under a variety of weather conditions, a total of 200 slabs of snow were taken from different depths and measured with free-space transmission systems operating at 12 GHz, 18 GHz (occasionally) and 35 GHz. This paper concentrates on the 37 and 16.5 GHz radiometer results for dry snow and also discusses the effects of snow wetness to the brightness temperature.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4241146","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IGARSS.2006.565","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Symposium on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Symposium on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4087812/4241146/04241712.pdf","startPage":"2186","endPage":"2189","doi":"10.1109/IGARSS.2006.565","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Results from a Ground-Based Microwave Multi-Frequency Radiometer Campaign of Seasonal Snow in Finland","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"July 31 2006-Aug. 4 2006","displayDocTitle":"Results from a Ground-Based Microwave Multi-Frequency Radiometer Campaign of Seasonal Snow in Finland","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"31 July-4 Aug. 2006","htmlLink":"/document/4241712/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2006","accessionNumber":"10265394","dateOfInsertion":"18 June 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4241712/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Results from a Ground-Based Microwave Multi-Frequency Radiometer Campaign of Seasonal Snow in Finland","confLoc":"Denver, CO, USA","sourcePdf":"03_16P06.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038735S","chronDate":"July 31 2006-Aug. 4 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4087812","isNumber":"4241146","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4087812","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4241146","articleId":"4241712","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4241832,"authors":[{"name":"B.

The framework for this ANN based model is a common-emitter large-signal equivalent circuit model, which has been implemented in Agilent Advance Design System (ADS) simulation environment. An excellent agreement between modeled and bias dependent DC and S -parameters and harmonic power in non-linear mode of operation was obtained. Using developed ANN based HBT model PA design was carried out.

The technique targets to achieve an interconnect- efficient architecture that reduces the area and delay of the decoder implementation while maintaining good error correction performance. With a fully parallel implementation of the LDPC decoder, the proposed design assumes a constraint on the interconnect wire length which has a direct impact on the maximum signal delay and power dissipation. Furthermore, this design approach is shown to lower interconnect routing congestion, and hence reduce the chip area and maximize chip utilization.","doi":"10.1109/ICM.2006.373283","publicationTitle":"2006 International Conference on Microelectronics","startPage":"127","endPage":"130","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICM.2006.373283","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4243632","pdfPath":"/iel5/4243631/4243632/04243665.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 International Conference on Microelectronics","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Parity check codes","Maximum likelihood decoding","Routing","Error correction codes","Delay","Power dissipation","Wires","Forward error correction","Iterative decoding","Codecs"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decoding","error correction codes","integrated circuit interconnections","parity check codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["LDPC code design","hardware-oriented technique","low density parity check codes","decoder","error correction","interconnect wire length"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Interconnect-Efficient LDPC Code Design","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4243665/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4243665/","accessionNumber":"10289975","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"18 June 2007","publicationDate":"Dec. 2006","conferenceDate":"16-19 Dec. 2006","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"16-19 Dec. 2006","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Interconnect-Efficient LDPC Code Design","confLoc":"Dhahran, Saudi Arabia","sourcePdf":"ICM-00-32.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045255S","chronDate":"16-19 Dec. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4243631","isNumber":"4243632","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4243631","xplore-issue":"4243632","articleId":"4243665","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4243672,"authors":[{"name":"Bambang A.

Several algorithms have been proposed in the literature for synthesis of multiple valued logic functions. None of these algorithms provides absolute optimum results for synthesis of these functions. The search space is too large to be explored by deterministic algorithms. In this paper, a Genetic Algorithm based algorithm for synthesis of MVL functions is proposed. The algorithm is tested using 200 randomly generated 2-variable 4-valued functions. The results obtained show that the introduced algorithm outperforms the deterministic technique based on the direct cover approach in terms of the average number of product terms required to realize a given MVL function.","doi":"10.1109/ICM.2006.373290","pdfPath":"/iel5/4243631/4243632/04243672.pdf","startPage":"154","endPage":"157","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 International Conference on Microelectronics","publicationTitle":"2006 International Conference on Microelectronics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICM.2006.373290","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4243632","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Synthesis of MVL Functions - Part I: The Genetic Algorithm Approach","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4243672/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-19 Dec. 2006","displayDocTitle":"Synthesis of MVL Functions - Part I: The Genetic Algorithm Approach","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"18 June 2007","accessionNumber":"10289982","publicationDate":"Dec. 2006","htmlLink":"/document/4243672/","conferenceDate":"16-19 Dec. 2006","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Synthesis of MVL Functions - Part I: The Genetic Algorithm Approach","confLoc":"Dhahran, Saudi Arabia","sourcePdf":"ICM-00-39.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070767S","chronDate":"16-19 Dec. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4243631","isNumber":"4243632","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4243631","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4243632","articleId":"4243672","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4243676,"authors":[{"name":"Jason G.

In many applications, soft-core processors provide several advantages over custom designed processors such as reduced cost, flexibility, platform independence and greater immunity to obsolescence. Embedded systems are hardware and software components working together to perform a specific function. Usually they contain embedded processors that are often in the form of soft-core processors that execute software code. This paper presents a survey of soft-core processors that are used in embedded systems. Several soft-core processors available from commercial vendors and open-source communities are reviewed and compared based on major architectural features. In addition, several real world examples of embedded systems that employ soft-core processors are summarized. As the complexity of embedded systems continues to increase, it is expected that the usage of customizable soft-core processors will become more widespread.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICM.2006.373294","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4243632","startPage":"170","endPage":"173","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 International Conference on Microelectronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/4243631/4243632/04243676.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Soft-Core Processors for Embedded Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4243676/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-19 Dec. 2006","htmlLink":"/document/4243676/","displayDocTitle":"Soft-Core Processors for Embedded Systems","conferenceDate":"16-19 Dec. 2006","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2006","accessionNumber":"10289986","dateOfInsertion":"18 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Soft-Core Processors for Embedded Systems","confLoc":"Dhahran, Saudi Arabia","sourcePdf":"ICM-00-43.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038193S","chronDate":"16-19 Dec. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4243631","isNumber":"4243632","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4243631","citationCount":"51","xplore-issue":"4243632","articleId":"4243676","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4243689,"authors":[{"name":"Seyed E.

The current practice of only measuring monitor wafers may not be able to timely detect the equipment-performance drift happening in-between the scheduled measurements. This may cause defects of production wafers and, thereby, raise the production cost. In this paper, a novel virtual metrology scheme (VMS) is proposed for overcoming this problem. The proposed VMS is capable of predicting the quality of each production wafer using parameters data from production equipment. Consequently, equipment-performance drift can be detected promptly. A radial basis function neural network is adopted to construct the virtual metrology model. Also, a model parameter coordinator is developed to effectively increase the prediction accuracy of the VMS. The chemical vapor deposition (CVD) process in semiconductor manufacturing is used to test and verify the effectiveness of the proposed VMS. Test results show that the proposed VMS demonstrates several advantages over the one based on back-propagation neural network and can achieve high prediction accuracy with mean absolute percentage error being 0.34% and maximum error being 1.15%. The proposed VMS is simple yet effective, and can be practically applied to construct the prediction models of semiconductor CVD processes.","doi":"10.1109/TMECH.2007.897275","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/3516/4244368/04244383.pdf","startPage":"308","endPage":"316","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMECH.2007.897275","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4244368","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Novel Virtual Metrology Scheme for Predicting CVD Thickness in Semiconductor Manufacturing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4244383","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 June 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4244383/","displayDocTitle":"A Novel Virtual Metrology Scheme for Predicting CVD Thickness in Semiconductor Manufacturing","volume":"12","issue":"3","publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9591475","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4244383/","dateOfInsertion":"18 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel Virtual Metrology Scheme for Predicting CVD Thickness in Semiconductor Manufacturing","sourcePdf":"12tmech03-hung2.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.072083S","chronDate":"June  2007","xplore-pub-id":"3516","isNumber":"4244368","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3516","citationCount":"78","xplore-issue":"4244368","articleId":"4244383","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4244387,"authors":[{"name":"Ming-Yih Lee","affiliation":["Graduate Institute of Medical Mechatronics, Chang Gung University, Taoyuan, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/3516/4244368/4244387/4244387-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ming-Yih Lee (M'96) received the Ph.D. degree in mechanical engineering from the University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, in 1991.","From 1984 to 1992, he was a Robotic Engineering Manager with CIMCORP, Inc., St. Paul, MN.

The proposed system was used for enhancing standing balance and gait performance for amputees. In this pilot study, we hypothesized that the static balance with single limb support and gait performance during treadmill walking could be improved by providing proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation using subsensory stimulation and visual-auditory biofeedback in amputee, respectively. To test this hypothesis, five unilateral transtibial amputees who consecutively wore prosthetics over two years were recruited. Experimental results show a reduction in all of the postural sway indexes and increase in single-leg support time index during single-leg quiet standing by applying subsensory stimulation. With visual-auditory biofeedback for providing clue for heel contact and toe push-off condition during treadmill ambulation, an improvement in all four dynamic gait performance indexes in amputees was verified. These findings suggest that the proposed system with subsensory electrical stimulation and visual-auditory biofeedback mechanisms may be effective in compensating sensory loss and improving posture control for amputees.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4244387/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 June 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4244387/","dateOfInsertion":"18 June 2007","publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9596656","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"12","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"New Foot Pressure Activated Sensory Compensation System for Posture-Control Enhancement in Amputees","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"New Foot Pressure Activated Sensory Compensation System for Posture-Control Enhancement in Amputees","sourcePdf":"12tmech03-lee.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.051997S","chronDate":"June  2007","xplore-pub-id":"3516","isNumber":"4244368","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3516","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"4244368","articleId":"4244387","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4244406,"authors":[{"name":"Varghese Baby","affiliation":["Marusyk, Miller and Swain Limited Liability Partnership, Ottawa, ONT, Canada"],"bio":{"p":["Varghese Baby was born in Trivandrum, Kerala, India, in 1978.

In these MOPAs, the final-stage high-power amplifier operates with high efficiency of 70%-80%, and a high gain of over 20 dB in a near diffraction-limited beam. We report at least 7-dB enhancement of the stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS) threshold for the 402-W polarization-maintaining (PM) YDF. In fact, we did not see any sign of SBS even at the highest output power. We eventually observed SBS appearance at around 500 W for the non-PM YDF. The observed SBS strengths were far weaker than expected in theory, unless we allowed for the Brillouin gain reduction from thermal Brillouin gain broadening induced by the quantum-defect heating.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4244429/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May-june  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 June 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4244429/","dateOfInsertion":"18 June 2007","publicationDate":"May-june 2007","accessionNumber":"9598888","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"13","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Power Scaling of Single-Frequency Ytterbium-Doped Fiber Master-Oscillator Power-Amplifier Sources up to 500 W","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power Scaling of Single-Frequency Ytterbium-Doped Fiber Master-Oscillator Power-Amplifier Sources up to 500 W","sourcePdf":"13jstqe03-jeong.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.053531S","chronDate":"May-june  2007","xplore-pub-id":"2944","isNumber":"4244401","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"2944","citationCount":"169","xplore-issue":"4244401","articleId":"4244429","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-22"},{"_id":4244434,"authors":[{"name":"Jens Limpert","affiliation":["Institute of Applied Physics, Friedrich Schiller University, Jena, Germany"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/2944/4244401/4244434/4244434-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jens Limpert was born in Jena, Germany, on December 11, 1975.

We introduce, two methods based on the sparsity assumption of the sources in the time-frequency (TF) domain. The first one assumes that the sources are disjoint in the TF domain, i.e., there is at most one source signal present at a given point in the TF domain. In the second method, we relax this assumption by allowing the sources to be TF-nondisjoint to a certain extent. In particular, the number of sources present (active) at a TF point should be strictly less than the number of sensors. In that case, the separation can be achieved thanks to subspace projection which allows us to identify the active sources and to estimate their corresponding time-frequency distribution (TFD) values. Another contribution of this paper is a new estimation procedure for the mixing channel in the underdetermined case. Finally, numerical performance evaluations and comparisons of the proposed methods are provided highlighting their effectiveness.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4244507/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"15","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2007","dateOfInsertion":"18 June 2007","accessionNumber":"9883730","htmlLink":"/document/4244507/","displayDocTitle":"Blind Separation of Underdetermined Convolutive Mixtures Using Their Time\u2013Frequency Representation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Blind Separation of Underdetermined Convolutive Mixtures Using Their Time\u2013Frequency Representation","sourcePdf":"15tasl05-aisselbey.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.100079S","chronDate":"July  2007","xplore-pub-id":"10376","isNumber":"4244504","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10376","citationCount":"32","xplore-issue":"4244504","articleId":"4244507","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4244514,"authors":[{"name":"Scott C.

The techniques converge quickly to a separation solution without any step size selection or divergence difficulties, and unlike other methods, ours do not require special coefficient initialization procedures to obtain good separation performance. They also allow for the efficient reconstruction of individual signals as observed in the sensor measurements directly from the system parameters for single-input multiple-output blind source separation tasks. An analysis of one of the adaptive constraint procedures shows its fast convergence to a paraunitary filter bank solution.

Simulation results are shown to verify the analysis.","doi":"10.1109/TASL.2007.896671","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/10376/4244504/04244522.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TASL.2007.896671","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4244504","startPage":"1681","endPage":"1695","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Selective-Tap Adaptive Filtering With Performance Analysis for Identification of Time-Varying Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4244522","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Selective-Tap Adaptive Filtering With Performance Analysis for Identification of Time-Varying Systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4244522/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 June 2007","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"15","issue":"5","publicationDate":"July 2007","accessionNumber":"9649114","dateOfInsertion":"18 June 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4244522/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Selective-Tap Adaptive Filtering With Performance Analysis for Identification of Time-Varying Systems","sourcePdf":"15tasl05-khong.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.091307S","chronDate":"July  2007","xplore-pub-id":"10376","isNumber":"4244504","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10376","citationCount":"35","xplore-issue":"4244504","articleId":"4244522","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4244535,"authors":[{"name":"Alexey Ozerov","affiliation":["Orange Laboratories, Cesson-Sevigne, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/10376/4244504/4244535/4244535-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Alexey Ozerov received the M.Sc. degree in mathematics from the Saint Petersburg State University, Saint Petersburg, Russia, in 1999, the M.Sc. degree in applied mathematics from the University of Bordeaux 1, Bordeaux, France, in 2003, and the Ph.D. degree in signal processing from the University of Rennes 1, Rennes, France, in 2006.","He was with Orange Labs, Cesson S\u00e9vign\u00e9, France, and the IRISA, Rennes, from 2003 to 2006 while working towards the Ph.D. degree.

We adopt two separation techniques, independent component analysis (ICA) and time-frequency (T-F) masking, for the frequency-domain BSS. With ICA, grouping the frequency components corresponds to aligning the permutation ambiguity of the ICA solution in each frequency bin. With T-F masking, grouping the frequency components corresponds to classifying sensor observations in the time-frequency domain for individual sources. The grouping procedure is based on estimating anechoic propagation model parameters by analyzing ICA results or sensor observations. More specifically, the time delays of arrival and attenuations from a source to all sensors are estimated for each source. The focus of this paper includes the applicability of the proposed procedure for a situation with wide sensor spacing where spatial aliasing may occur. Experimental results show that the proposed procedure effectively separates two or three sources with several sensor configurations in a real room, as long as the room reverberation is moderately low.","doi":"10.1109/TASL.2007.899218","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/10376/4244504/04244536.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TASL.2007.899218","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4244504","startPage":"1592","endPage":"1604","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Grouping Separated Frequency Components by Estimating Propagation Model Parameters in Frequency-Domain Blind Source Separation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4244536","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Grouping Separated Frequency Components by Estimating Propagation Model Parameters in Frequency-Domain Blind Source Separation","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4244536/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 June 2007","isJournal":true,"volume":"15","issue":"5","publicationDate":"July 2007","accessionNumber":"9649108","dateOfInsertion":"18 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Grouping Separated Frequency Components by Estimating Propagation Model Parameters in Frequency-Domain Blind Source Separation","sourcePdf":"15tasl05-sawada.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041956S","chronDate":"July  2007","isNumber":"4244504","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10376","citationCount":"92","articleId":"4244536","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4244539,"authors":[{"name":"Mark D.

Recently, a recurrent neural network with simplified training, the echo state network (ESN), was introduced by Jaeger and shown to outperform conventional methods in time series prediction experiments. We created the predictive ESN classifier by combining the ESN with a state machine framework. In small-vocabulary ASR experiments, we compared the noise-robust performance of the predictive ESN classifier with a hidden Markov model (HMM) as a function of model size and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). The predictive ESN classifier outperformed an HMM by 8-dB SNR, and both models achieved maximum noise-robust accuracy for architectures with more states and fewer kernels per state. Using ten trials of random sets of training/validation/test speakers, accuracy for the predictive ESN classifier, averaged between 0 and 20 dB SNR, was 81plusmn3%, compared to 61plusmn2% for an HMM. The closed-form regression training for the ESN significantly reduced the computational cost of the network, and the reservoir of the ESN created a high-dimensional representation of the input with memory which led to increased noise-robust classification.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/10376/4244504/04244539.pdf","startPage":"1724","endPage":"1730","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Noise-Robust Automatic Speech Recognition Using a Predictive Echo State Network","doi":"10.1109/TASL.2007.896669","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4244504","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TASL.2007.896669","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4244539","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4244539/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 June 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2007","displayDocTitle":"Noise-Robust Automatic Speech Recognition Using a Predictive Echo State Network","dateOfInsertion":"18 June 2007","publicationDate":"July 2007","accessionNumber":"9649107","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"15","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/4244539/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Noise-Robust Automatic Speech Recognition Using a Predictive Echo State Network","sourcePdf":"15tasl05-skowronski.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.075039S","chronDate":"July  2007","xplore-pub-id":"10376","isNumber":"4244504","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10376","citationCount":"56","xplore-issue":"4244504","articleId":"4244539","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4244540,"authors":[{"name":"Ernst Warsitz","affiliation":["Department of Communications Engineering, University of Paderborn, Paderborn, Germany"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/10376/4244504/4244540/4244540-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ernst Warsitz (S'06) was born in 1971.

While this approach has extensively been employed in narrowband (antenna) array beamforming, it is typically not used for broadband (microphone) array beamforming due to the uncontrolled amount of speech distortion introduced by a narrowband SNR criterion. In this paper, we show how the distortion of the desired signal can be controlled by a single-channel post-filter, resulting in a performance comparable to the generalized minimum variance distortionless response beamformer, where arbitrary transfer functions relate the source and the microphones. Results are given both for directional and diffuse noise. A novel gradient ascent adaptation algorithm is presented, and its good convergence properties are experimentally revealed by comparison with alternatives from the literature. A key feature of the proposed beamformer is that it operates blindly, i.e., it neither requires knowledge about the array geometry nor an explicit estimation of the transfer functions from source to sensors or the direction-of-arrival.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 June 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4244540/","volume":"15","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/4244540/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9660948","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 2007","dateOfInsertion":"18 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Blind Acoustic Beamforming Based on Generalized Eigenvalue Decomposition","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Blind Acoustic Beamforming Based on Generalized Eigenvalue Decomposition","sourcePdf":"15tasl05-warsitz.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.229173S","chronDate":"July  2007","xplore-pub-id":"10376","isNumber":"4244504","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10376","citationCount":"96","xplore-issue":"4244504","articleId":"4244540","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4244541,"authors":[{"name":"Masahiro Yukawa","affiliation":["RIKEN, Saitama, Japan","Department of Communications and Integrated Systems, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Tokyo, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/10376/4244504/4244541/4244541-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Masahiro Yukawa (S'06\u2013M'07) received the B.E., M.E., and Ph.D. degrees from the Tokyo Institute of Technology, Tokyo, Japan, in 2002, 2004, and 2006, respectively.","From April 2005 to March 2007, he was a Research Fellow of the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS).

The key is to incorporate a priori (or a posteriori) information on characteristics of an estimandum, a system to be estimated, into the metric design. We propose a family of efficient adaptive filtering algorithms based on a parallel use of quadratic-metric projection, which assigns every point to the nearest point in a closed convex set in a quadratic-metric sense. We present two versions: (1) constant-metric and (2) variable-metric, i.e., the metric function employed is (1) constant and (2) variable among iterations. As a constant-metric version, adaptive parallel quadratic-metric projection (APQP) and adaptive parallel min-max quadratic-metric projection (APMQP) algorithms are naturally derived by APSM, being endowed with desirable properties such as convergence to a point optimal in asymptotic sense. As a variable-metric version, adaptive parallel variable-metric projection (APVP) algorithm is derived by a generalized APSM, enjoying an extended monotone property at each iteration. By employing a simple quadratic-metric, the computational complexity of the proposed algorithms is kept linear with respect to the filter length. Numerical examples demonstrate the remarkable advantages of the proposed algorithms in an application to acoustic echo cancellation.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Parallel Quadratic-Metric Projection Algorithms","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","doi":"10.1109/TASL.2007.896655","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/10376/4244504/04244541.pdf","startPage":"1665","endPage":"1680","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TASL.2007.896655","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4244504","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4244541","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4244541/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 June 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2007","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Parallel Quadratic-Metric Projection Algorithms","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"15","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/4244541/","dateOfInsertion":"18 June 2007","publicationDate":"July 2007","accessionNumber":"9649106","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Parallel Quadratic-Metric Projection Algorithms","sourcePdf":"15tasl05-yukawa.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.212369S","chronDate":"July  2007","xplore-pub-id":"10376","isNumber":"4244504","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10376","citationCount":"38","xplore-issue":"4244504","articleId":"4244541","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4244543,"authors":[{"name":"Xinglei Zhu","affiliation":["Media Understanding Department, Institute for Infocomm Research, Singapore"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/10376/4244504/4244543/4244543-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Xinglei Zhu received the B.S. degree in computer science from the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC), Hefei, Anhui, China, in 2002 and the M.S. degree in computer science from the National University of Singapore (NUS), Singapore, in 2004.","He is currently a Research Engineer in the Media Understanding Department, Institute for Infocomm Research, Singapore.

The key issue is how to invert a sequence of overlapping magnitude spectra (a ldquospectrogramrdquo) containing no phase information to generate a real-valued signal free of audible artifacts. Also important is that the algorithm performs in real-time, both structurally and computationally. In the context of spectrogram inversion, structurally real-time means that the audio signal at any given point in time only depends on transform frames at local or prior points in time. Computationally, real-time means that the algorithm is efficient enough to run in less time than the reconstructed audio takes to play on the available hardware. The spectrogram inversion algorithm is parameterized to allow tradeoffs between computational demands and the quality of the signal reconstruction. The algorithm is applied to audio time-scale and pitch modification and compared to classical algorithms for these tasks on a variety of signal types including both monophonic and polyphonic audio signals such as speech and music.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/10376/4244504/04244543.pdf","startPage":"1645","endPage":"1653","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","doi":"10.1109/TASL.2007.899236","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TASL.2007.899236","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4244504","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4244543","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Real-Time Signal Estimation From Modified Short-Time Fourier Transform Magnitude Spectra","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Estimation","Fourier transforms","Time domain analysis","Signal processing","Spectrogram","Speech","Signal reconstruction","Multiple signal classification","Time frequency analysis","Signal analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["audio signal processing","Fourier transform spectra","signal reconstruction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["real-time signal estimation","spectrogram inversion","audio signal","signal reconstruction","monophonic audio signals","polyphonic audio signals","short-time Fourier transform magnitude spectra","pitch modification","speech","music","time-scale modification"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Magnitude-only reconstruction","real-time systems","signal estimation","spectrogram inversion","time-scale modification (TSM)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4244543/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 June 2007","displayDocTitle":"Real-Time Signal Estimation From Modified Short-Time Fourier Transform Magnitude Spectra","volume":"15","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/4244543/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2007","accessionNumber":"9660949","dateOfInsertion":"18 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Real-Time Signal Estimation From Modified Short-Time Fourier Transform Magnitude Spectra","sourcePdf":"15tasl05-zhu.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.108934S","chronDate":"July  2007","xplore-pub-id":"10376","isNumber":"4244504","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10376","citationCount":"59","xplore-issue":"4244504","articleId":"4244543","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-19"},{"_id":4244565,"authors":[{"name":"Pong C.

A two-phase method, namely, sketch-to-mug-shot matching and human face image searching using relevance feedback, is designed and developed. In the sketch-to-mug-shot matching phase, we have developed a facial feature matching algorithm using local and global features. A point distribution model is employed to represent local facial features while the global feature consists of a set of the geometrical relationship between facial features. It is found that the performance of the sketch-to-mug-shot matching is good if the sketch image looks like the mug shot image in the database. However, in some situations, it is hard to construct a sketch that looks like the photograph. To overcome this limitation, this paper makes use of the concept of ldquohuman-in-the-looprdquo and proposes a human face image searching algorithm using relevance feedback in the second phase. Positive and negative samples will be collected from the user. A feedback algorithm that employs subspace linear discriminant analysis for online learning of the optimal projection for face representation is then designed and developed.

To efficiently simulate field interactions with such structures, three different solvers are hybridized: (1) a time-domain integral-equation (TDIE)-based field solver that computes fields on the exterior structure comprising platforms, antennas, enclosures, boards, and cable shields (external fields); (2) a modified nodal-analysis (MNA)-based circuit solver that computes currents and voltages on lumped circuits approximating cable connectors/loads; and (3) a TDIE-based transmission line solver that computes transmission line voltages and currents at cable terminations (guided fields). These three solvers are rigorously interfaced at the cable connectors/loads and along the cable shields; the resulting coupled system of equations is solved simultaneously at each time step. Computation of the external and guided fields, which constitutes the computational bottleneck of this approach, is accelerated using fast Fourier transform-based algorithms. Further acceleration is achieved by parallelizing the computation of external fields. The resulting hybrid solver permits the analysis of electrically large and geometrically intricate structures loaded with coaxial cables. The accuracy, efficiency, and versatility of the proposed solver are demonstrated by analyzing several EMC/EMI problems including interference between a log-periodic monopole array trailing an aircraft's wing and a monopole antenna mounted on its fuselage, coupling into coaxial cables connecting shielded printed circuit boards located inside a cockpit, and coupling into coaxial cables from a cell phone antenna located inside a fuselage.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fast and Rigorous Analysis of EMC/EMI Phenomena on Electrically Large and Complex Cable-Loaded Structures","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electromagnetic Compatibility","doi":"10.1109/TEMC.2007.897159","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electromagnetic Compatibility","pdfPath":"/iel5/15/4244571/04244572.pdf","startPage":"361","endPage":"381","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEMC.2007.897159","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4244571","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4244572","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4244572/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 June 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2007","displayDocTitle":"Fast and Rigorous Analysis of EMC/EMI Phenomena on Electrically Large and Complex Cable-Loaded Structures","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"49","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/4244572/","dateOfInsertion":"18 June 2007","publicationDate":"May 2007","accessionNumber":"9591483","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast and Rigorous Analysis of EMC/EMI Phenomena on Electrically Large and Complex Cable-Loaded Structures","sourcePdf":"49temc02-bagci.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.087509S","chronDate":"May  2007","isNumber":"4244571","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"15","citationCount":"69","articleId":"4244572","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":4244577,"authors":[{"name":"Heinz-Dietrich Bruns","affiliation":["Institute of Electromagnetic Theory, Hamburg University of Technology, Hamburg, Germany"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/15/4244571/4244577/4244577-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Heinz-Dietrich Br\u00fcns was born in Bremerhaven, Germany, in 1953.

Compared with the alternating-direction implicit (ADI)-FDTD method, this NWCS-FDTD method has higher accuracy, especially for larger time-step size. At each time step, the NWCS-FDTD method requires the solution of four tridiagonal matrices and four explicit updates. While maintaining the same size of the time step, the CPU time for this weakly conditionally stable FDTD method can be reduced to about two-thirds of that for the ADI-FDTD scheme.

As a consequence, the scientific community has devoted much effort in the direction of a more accurate modeling of underground lightning fields and their coupling to cables. The exact expressions of the underground lightning fields have been derived by Sommerfeld decades ago. However, their numerical evaluation has always been a hard task because of the presence of slowly converging improper integrals. In the past, some approximate formulas have been derived, which have been included in field-to-transmission line coupling models to estimate the effect of lightning on buried cables. In this paper, an efficient algorithm for the evaluation of the Sommerfeld expression for underground fields is presented, and its mathematical features are discussed. The numerical treatment of the Sommerfeld integrals is based on a proper subdivision of the integration domain, the application of the Romberg technique, and the definition of a suitable upper bound for the error due to the integral truncation. The remarkable efficiency in terms of CPU time of the developed algorithm makes it possible to use it directly in field-to-buried cable coupling simulation codes. Finally, the developed algorithm is used to test the validity of the Cooray's simplified formula for the computation of underground horizontal electric field. It is shown that predictions of the Cooray's formula are in good agreement with exact solutions for large values of ground conductivity (0.01 S/m). However, for poor conductivities (0.001 S/m or so) Cooray's expression yields less satisfactory results, especially for the late time response.","doi":"10.1109/TEMC.2007.897127","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electromagnetic Compatibility","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electromagnetic Compatibility","pdfPath":"/iel5/15/4244571/04244587.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEMC.2007.897127","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4244571","startPage":"401","endPage":"411","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Algorithm for the Exact Evaluation of the Underground Lightning Electromagnetic Fields","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4244587","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"An Algorithm for the Exact Evaluation of the Underground Lightning Electromagnetic Fields","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4244587/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 June 2007","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"49","issue":"2","publicationDate":"May 2007","accessionNumber":"9591489","dateOfInsertion":"18 June 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4244587/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Algorithm for the Exact Evaluation of the Underground Lightning Electromagnetic Fields","sourcePdf":"49temc02-delfino.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.066292S","chronDate":"May  2007","xplore-pub-id":"15","isNumber":"4244571","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"15","citationCount":"46","xplore-issue":"4244571","articleId":"4244587","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4244588,"authors":[{"name":"Junhong Deng","affiliation":["Telecoms and EMC Test Centre, T\u00dcV S\u00dcD PSB, Singapore, Singapore"],"firstName":"Junhong","lastName":"Deng","id":"38201037100"},{"name":"Kye Yak See","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, Singapore"],"firstName":"Kye Yak","lastName":"See","id":"37290485100"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9375"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-187X"}],"articleNumber":"4244588","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":34,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":710},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Electromagnetic Compatibility Society","url":"http://www.ewh.ieee.org/soc/emcs/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electric impedance measurement","inductors","probes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["premeasurement characterization process","radio-frequency impedance","current probes measurement method","common-mode chokes","in-circuit characterization"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Electromagnetic compatibility","filters","impedance measurement","measurement","power filters"]}],"abstract":"The two current probes measurement method was employed by other researchers to measure the radio-frequency impedance of AC power mains.

The aim of the analysis is to investigate the impact of frequency- modulated harmonic noises generated by spread-spectrum clock (SSC) systems in PCs. SSC techniques are commonly employed in order to reduce the spectral amplitude of clock harmonics measured in EMI compliance tests. The results of the analysis revealed that: (1) BER can be seriously affected in an actual situation where a WLAN antenna installed in or placed very close to a PC receives noise generated by the PC itself; (2) the forward error correction (FEC) in IEEE802.11 a/g becomes less effective as the frequency variation rate of the harmonic increases; and (3) frequency-modulated clock harmonics have a greater negative effect on BER than unmodulated harmonics do. Thus, SSC does not necessarily reduce the impact of clock harmonics on OFDM-based WLAN systems, even if the spectral amplitude of the harmonics is reduced. The impact of clock harmonics on WLAN is compared with that of other wideband noises. Discussion is further extended to cover how to mitigate the interference.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electromagnetic Compatibility","pdfPath":"/iel5/15/4244571/04244609.pdf","startPage":"455","endPage":"462","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electromagnetic Compatibility","doi":"10.1109/TEMC.2007.893328","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEMC.2007.893328","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4244571","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4244609","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Impact of Frequency-Modulated Harmonic Noises From PCs on OFDM-Based WLAN Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Frequency modulation","Harmonic analysis","Wireless LAN","Clocks","OFDM","Antenna measurements","Interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["clocks","electromagnetic interference","error statistics","interference suppression","noise","OFDM modulation","spread spectrum communication","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["interference mitigation","IEEE802.11 a/g","FEC","forward error correction","clock harmonics","spread-spectrum clock","personal computers","EMI","electromagnetic interference","wireless LAN","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","BER","bit error rate","OFDM-based WLAN systems","frequency-modulated harmonic noises"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Clock frequency modulation (FM)","interference","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM)","spread-spectrum clock (SSC)","wireless LAN (WLAN)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4244609/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 June 2007","displayDocTitle":"Impact of Frequency-Modulated Harmonic Noises From PCs on OFDM-Based WLAN Systems","volume":"49","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/4244609/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2007","accessionNumber":"9591503","dateOfInsertion":"18 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Impact of Frequency-Modulated Harmonic Noises From PCs on OFDM-Based WLAN Systems","sourcePdf":"49temc02-matsumoto-cr.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.281397S","chronDate":"May  2007","xplore-pub-id":"15","isNumber":"4244571","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"15","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"4244571","articleId":"4244609","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-22"},{"_id":4244639,"authors":[{"name":"Ari Abramson","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Technion-Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, Israel"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/4244638/4244639/4244639-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ari Abramson (S'06) received the B.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from Tel-Aviv University, Israel, in 2002.","He is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering in the direct-tract doctoral program of the Technion\u2014Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, Israel.

The expansion coefficients in the STFT domain are modeled as a multivariate complex GARCH process with Markov-switching regimes. The GARCH formulation parameterizes the correlation between sequential conditional variances while the Markov chain allows the process to switch between regimes of different GARCH formulations. We obtain a necessary and sufficient condition for the asymptotic wide-sense stationarity of the model, and develop a recursive algorithm for signal restoration in a noisy environment. The conditional variance is estimated by iterating propagation and update steps with regime conditional probabilities, while the model parameters are evaluated a priori from a training data set. Experimental results demonstrate the performance of the proposed algorithm.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Recursive Supervised Estimation of a Markov-Switching GARCH Process in the Short-Time Fourier Transform Domain","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2007.894422","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/4244638/04244639.pdf","startPage":"3227","endPage":"3238","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2007.894422","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4244638","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4244639","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4244639/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 June 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2007","displayDocTitle":"Recursive Supervised Estimation of a Markov-Switching GARCH Process in the Short-Time Fourier Transform Domain","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"55","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/4244639/","dateOfInsertion":"18 June 2007","publicationDate":"July 2007","accessionNumber":"9597478","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Recursive Supervised Estimation of a Markov-Switching GARCH Process in the Short-Time Fourier Transform Domain","sourcePdf":"55tsp07-abramson-pt1.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.093193S","chronDate":"July  2007","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"4244638","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4244638","articleId":"4244639","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4244642,"authors":[{"name":"Ali N.

It is well known in the literature that they perform poorly for the case of asynchronous multiuser communications. Therefore, the near-orthogonal and nonlinear phase gold codes with better performance are the preferred user codes in asynchronous direct sequence code division multiple access (DS-CDMA) communications standards. In this paper, we relaxed linear phase requirements and new sets of Walsh-like nonlinear phase binary orthogonal user codes (transforms) are obtained for asynchronous and synchronous spread spectrum multiuser communications. It is shown that the proposed binary user code family outperforms the Walsh codes significantly and they match in performance with the popular, nearly orthogonal gold codes closely for asynchronous multiuser communications in additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channels. It is also shown that all of the binary code families considered in this paper performed comparable for Rayleigh flat-fading channels. We present in this paper that there are a good number of such desirable code sets available in the binary sample space with different transform sizes. These new binary sets with good performance and flexible code lengths might help us to improve the spread spectrum multiplexing capabilities of future wireline and wireless CDMA communications systems.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2007.894229","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/4244641/04244642.pdf","startPage":"3800","endPage":"3806","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2007.894229","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4244641","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Walsh-Like Nonlinear Phase Orthogonal Codes for Direct Sequence CDMA Communications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4244642","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 June 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4244642/","displayDocTitle":"Walsh-Like Nonlinear Phase Orthogonal Codes for Direct Sequence CDMA Communications","volume":"55","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 2007","accessionNumber":"9591509","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4244642/","dateOfInsertion":"18 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Walsh-Like Nonlinear Phase Orthogonal Codes for Direct Sequence CDMA Communications","sourcePdf":"55tsp07-akansu-pt2.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.082952S","chronDate":"July  2007","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"4244641","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"39","xplore-issue":"4244641","articleId":"4244642","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4244643,"authors":[{"name":"Tareq Y.

However, for proper recovery of the input, the OFDM receiver needs accurate channel information. In this paper, we propose an expectation-maximization algorithm for joint channel and data recovery in fast fading environments. The algorithm makes a collective use of the data and channel constraints inherent in the communication problem. This comes in contrast to other works which have employed these constraints selectively. The data constraints include pilots, the cyclic prefix, and the finite alphabet restriction, while the channel constraints include sparsity, finite delay spread, and the statistical properties of the channel (frequency and time correlation). The algorithm boils down to a forward-backward Kalman filter. We also suggest a suboptimal modification that is able to track the channel and recover the data with no latency. Simulations show the favorable behavior of both algorithms compared to other channel estimation techniques.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2007.894271","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/4244641/04244643.pdf","startPage":"3924","endPage":"3930","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2007.894271","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4244641","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An EM-Based Forward-Backward Kalman Filter for the Estimation of Time-Variant Channels in OFDM","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4244643","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 June 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4244643/","displayDocTitle":"An EM-Based Forward-Backward Kalman Filter for the Estimation of Time-Variant Channels in OFDM","volume":"55","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 2007","accessionNumber":"9591510","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4244643/","dateOfInsertion":"18 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An EM-Based Forward-Backward Kalman Filter for the Estimation of Time-Variant Channels in OFDM","sourcePdf":"55tsp07-alnaffouri-cr-pt2.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.087829S","chronDate":"July  2007","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"4244641","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"72","xplore-issue":"4244641","articleId":"4244643","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4244647,"authors":[{"name":"Sergio Barbarossa","affiliation":["INFOCOM Department, University of Roma La Sapienza, Rome, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/4244638/4244647/4244647-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Sergio Barbarossa (S'82\u2013M'88) received the M.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees, both in electrical engineering, from the University of Rome \u201cLa Sapienza,\u201d Rome, Italy, in 1984 and 1988, respectively.","In 1985, he joined the Radar System Division of Selenia as a Radar System Designer.

In this paper, we characterize the region under the assumption that the interference coupling between the users can be described by a parameter-dependent matrix, where the parameter stands for some receive (or transmit) strategy. This model holds for a large class of practically relevant system designs (e.g., beam- forming, CDMA). In general, interference coupling is strongly influenced by the receive strategy. Thus, classical results based on the assumption of fixed irreducible coupling matrices cannot be transferred directly. New techniques are required to describe systems, where users are partially decoupled because of the impact of the receive strategy. We develop an analytical framework, which considers the close interaction between receive strategy and power allocation, but without the restricting assumption of irreducibility. We characterize the structure of the boundary, and explain the system behavior in the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime. We provide conditions for existence and uniqueness of an optimal power allocation, given an optimal choice of receive strategy. We also discuss the duality between interference mitigation at the receiver and at the transmitter. Finally, we propose a globally convergent algorithm, which computes the min-max optimal power allocation under the assumption of block-irreducibility (independent irreducible subsystems).","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4244650/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"55","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2007","dateOfInsertion":"18 June 2007","accessionNumber":"9591539","htmlLink":"/document/4244650/","displayDocTitle":"On the Structure of the Multiuser QoS Region","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Structure of the Multiuser QoS Region","sourcePdf":"55tsp07-boche-pt1.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.077989S","chronDate":"July  2007","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"4244638","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"4244638","articleId":"4244650","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4244653,"authors":[{"name":"Chun-yang Chen","affiliation":["California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/4244638/4244653/4244653-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Chun-Yang Chen (S'05) was born in Taipei, Taiwan, R.O.C., on November 22, 1977.

It can be viewed as an alternative to the bit-loading method. In this paper, this precoded V-BLAST system is extended to the case of frequency-selective MIMO channels. Both the FIR and redundant types of transceivers, which use cyclic-prefixing and zero-padding, are considered. A fast algorithm for computing a cyclic-prefixing-based precoded V-BLAST transceiver is developed. Experiments show that the proposed methods with redundancy have better performance than the SVD-based system with optimal powerloading and bit loading for frequency-selective MIMO channels.

Assuming full knowledge of the channel state information at the transmitter and the different receivers, a new transmission scheme that employs partial interference cancellation at the transmitter with dirty-paper encoding and decoding is proposed. The maximal achievable throughput of this system is characterized, and it is shown that given any ordered set of users the proposed scheme is asymptotically optimal in the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime. In addition, with optimal user ordering, the proposed scheme is shown to be optimal in the low-SNR regime. We also consider a linear transmission scheme which employs only partial interuser interference cancellation at the base station without dirty-paper coding. Given a transmit power constraint at the base station, the sum-rate capacity of this scheme is characterized and a suboptimal precoding algorithm is proposed. In several cases, it is shown that, for all values of the SNR, the achievable throughput of this scheme is strictly larger than a system which employs full interference cancellation at the base station (Spencer et al., 2004). In addition, it is shown that, in some cases, the linear transmission scheme can support simultaneously an increased number of users while achieving a larger system throughput.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2007.894285","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/4244641/04244664.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2007.894285","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4244641","startPage":"3837","endPage":"3850","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Precoding for Multiple Antenna Gaussian Broadcast Channels With Successive Zero-Forcing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4244664","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Precoding for Multiple Antenna Gaussian Broadcast Channels With Successive Zero-Forcing","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4244664/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 June 2007","isJournal":true,"volume":"55","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 2007","accessionNumber":"9591511","dateOfInsertion":"18 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Precoding for Multiple Antenna Gaussian Broadcast Channels With Successive Zero-Forcing","sourcePdf":"55tsp07-dabbagh-pt2.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043402S","chronDate":"July  2007","isNumber":"4244641","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"91","articleId":"4244664","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":4244665,"authors":[{"name":"Antonio De Maio","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Ingegneria Elettronica e delle Telecomunicazioni, Universit\u00e0 degli Studi di Napoli \u201cFederico II\u201d, Napoli, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/4244641/4244665/4244665-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Antonio De Maio (S'01\u2013M'02) was born in Sorrento, Italy, on June 20, 1974.

A new detector based on the Rao test criterion is introduced and its invariance properties and constant false alarm rate (CFAR) behavior are studied. At the analysis stage, the performance of the new receiver is assessed, also in comparison with some classical adaptive radar detectors, both in the matched as well as in the mismatched signal case. Remarkably, the Rao test may achieve a matched detection performance which is commensurate with that of the generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT)-based detectors if a sufficient number of training data is available. Moreover, it also exhibits better rejection capabilities of mismatched signals than the counterparts. In the last part of the work, a two-stage detector whose second stage coincides with the Rao test is devised. It represents a suitable means to restore the detection performance of the plain Rao test in the presence of a small number of training data. Finally, the performance of the aforementioned two-stage processor is analyzed in closed form and the CFAR behavior is proved.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Rao Test for Adaptive Detection in Gaussian Interference With Unknown Covariance Matrix","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2007.894238","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/4244641/04244665.pdf","startPage":"3577","endPage":"3584","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2007.894238","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4244641","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4244665","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4244665/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 June 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2007","displayDocTitle":"Rao Test for Adaptive Detection in Gaussian Interference With Unknown Covariance Matrix","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"55","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/4244665/","dateOfInsertion":"18 June 2007","publicationDate":"July 2007","accessionNumber":"9591512","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Rao Test for Adaptive Detection in Gaussian Interference With Unknown Covariance Matrix","sourcePdf":"55tsp07-demaio-pt2.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.072031S","chronDate":"July  2007","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"4244641","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"164","xplore-issue":"4244641","articleId":"4244665","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4244670,"authors":[{"name":"Peilu Ding","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA","Motorola Laboratories, Motorola, Inc., Schaumburg, IL, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/4244638/4244670/4244670-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Peilu Ding (S'04\u2013M'06) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electronic engineering from Fudan University, Shanghai, China, in 1999 and 2002, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical and computer engineering from Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, in 2005.","He joined Motorola Labs in January 2006 as a Senior Research Engineer.

This paper is focused on characterizing the sum rate performance of both zero-forcing dirty paper coding (ZFDPC) systems and channel inversion (CI) systems under the given two partial CSIT models. Intuitively speaking, a system with shape feedback loses the sum rate gain of adaptive power allocation. However, shape feedback still provides enough channel knowledge for ZFDPC and CI to approach their own optimal throughput in the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime. As for limited feedback, we derive sum rate bounds for both signaling schemes and link their throughput performance to some basic properties of the quantization codebook. Interestingly, we find that limited feedback employing a fixed codebook leads to a sum rate ceiling for both schemes for asymptotically high SNR.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4244670/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 June 2007","volume":"55","issue":"7","accessionNumber":"9591542","publicationDate":"July 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4244670/","dateOfInsertion":"18 June 2007","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Multiple Antenna Broadcast Channels With Shape Feedback and Limited Feedback","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiple Antenna Broadcast Channels With Shape Feedback and Limited Feedback","sourcePdf":"55tsp07-ding-pt1.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.122478S","chronDate":"July  2007","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"4244638","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"138","xplore-issue":"4244638","articleId":"4244670","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4244678,"authors":[{"name":"Guang-Hong Yang","affiliation":["Northeastern University, Shenyang, Liaoning, CN"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/4244638/4244678/4244678-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Guang-Hong Yang (M'03\u2013SM'03) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in mathematics from Northeast University of Technology, China, in 1983 and 1986, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in control engineering from Northeastern University (formerly, Northeast University of Technology) in 1994.","He was a Lecturer/Associate Professor with Northeastern University from 1986 to 1995.

The implementations compared are based on a field-programmable gate array (FPGA) and a digital signal processor (DSP). The time-varying, frequency-dependent, phase-difference between each incoming sound signal is used to mask each respective frequency, thereby reducing noise by minimizing the contributions of signal frequency components that have a low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Phase-based filtering can achieve high SNR gains with just two microphones, making it ideal for small devices that lack the room for a multimicrophone array. Moreover, these devices often have a limited battery life and lack the processing power needed for software-based speech enhancement.

The sum rate for channel state information (CSI) feedback, however, increases linearly with the number of users, reducing the effective uplink capacity. To address this problem, a novel space division multiple access (SDMA) design is proposed, where the sum feedback rate is upper bounded by a constant. This design consists of algorithms for CSI quantization, threshold-based CSI feedback, and joint beamforming and scheduling. The key feature of the proposed approach is the use of feedback thresholds to select feedback users with large channel gains and small CSI quantization errors such that the sum feedback rate constraint is satisfied. Despite this constraint, the proposed SDMA design is shown to achieve a sum capacity growth rate close to the optimal one. Moreover, the feedback overflow probability for this design is found to decrease exponentially with the difference between the allowable and the average sum feedback rates. Numerical results show that the proposed SDMA design is capable of attaining higher sum capacities than existing ones, even though the sum feedback rate is bounded.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4244687/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 June 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2007","publicationDate":"July 2007","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4244687/","dateOfInsertion":"18 June 2007","accessionNumber":"9591516","volume":"55","issue":"7","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Space Division Multiple Access With a Sum Feedback Rate Constraint","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Space Division Multiple Access With a Sum Feedback Rate Constraint","sourcePdf":"55tsp07-huang-pt2.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.121625S","chronDate":"July  2007","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"4244641","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"104","xplore-issue":"4244641","articleId":"4244687","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4244696,"authors":[{"name":"Nima Khajehnouri","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Nima","lastName":"Khajehnouri","id":"37294476500"},{"name":"Ali H.

Since the sensors are typically small, power limited, and low cost, they are only able to broadcast low-power signals. As a result, the propagation loss from the origin to the destination nodes can attenuate the signals beyond detection. One way to deal with this problem is to pass the transmitted signal through relay nodes. In this paper we propose and study two-hop multisensor relay strategies that achieve minimum mean-square-error (MSE) performance subject to either local or global power constraints. The capacity of the resulting relay link and its diversity order are studied. The effect of channel uncertainties on system performance is examined and a modified relay scheme is proposed.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2007.894410","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/4244638/04244696.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2007.894410","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4244638","startPage":"3336","endPage":"3348","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed MMSE Relay Strategies for Wireless Sensor Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4244696","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Distributed MMSE Relay Strategies for Wireless Sensor Networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4244696/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 June 2007","isJournal":true,"volume":"55","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 2007","accessionNumber":"9591547","dateOfInsertion":"18 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed MMSE Relay Strategies for Wireless Sensor Networks","sourcePdf":"55tsp07-khajehnouri-pt1.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.035444S","chronDate":"July  2007","isNumber":"4244638","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"139","articleId":"4244696","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4244702,"authors":[{"name":"Athanasios P.

We observe that, in general, the mismatched MMSE equalizer performs (much) better than the LS equalizer. We attribute this phenomenon to the fact that the LS equalizer implicitly estimates the input second-order statistics, while the mismatched MMSE equalizer uses perfect knowledge. Thus, assuming that the input second-order statistics are known at the receiver, which is usually the case, the use of the mismatched MMSE equalizer is preferable, in general.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Equalizers","Statistics","Mean square error methods","Intersymbol interference","Cost function","Training data","Performance analysis","White noise","Gaussian noise","Adaptive algorithm"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["equalisers","intersymbol interference","least mean squares methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["intersymbol interference","performance analysis","finite-length linear equalizers","mismatched minimum mean square error equalizer","least-squares equalizer","matrix perturbation","excess mean square error","second-order statistics"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Intersymbol interference","least-squares (LS) equalization","minimum mean square error (MMSE) equalization","performance analysis"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4244638","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2007.894392","startPage":"3302","endPage":"3311","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/4244638/04244702.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2007.894392","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Performance of the Mismatched MMSE and the LS Linear Equalizers","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 June 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"On the Performance of the Mismatched MMSE and the LS Linear Equalizers","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9591548","publicationDate":"July 2007","volume":"55","issue":"7","dateOfInsertion":"18 June 2007","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4244702/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4244702/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Performance of the Mismatched MMSE and the LS Linear Equalizers","sourcePdf":"55tsp07-liavas-pt1.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.052569S","chronDate":"July  2007","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"4244638","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"4244638","articleId":"4244702","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4244703,"authors":[{"name":"Ke Liu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Ohio State Uinversity, Columbus, OH, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/4244638/4244703/4244703-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ke Liu (S'99\u2013M'05) received the B.S. degree in 1999 in electrical engineering from Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, the M.S. degree in 2001 in electrical engineering, the M.A. degree in 2002 in mathematics, and the Ph.D. degree in 2004 in electrical engineering, all from the University of Wisconsin at Madison.","From 2000 to 2004, he was a Research Assistant with the Wireless Communications Laboratory, University of Wisconsin-Madison.

In our setting, spatially distributed wireless sensor nodes collect observation data about a hidden source and communicate relevant statistics to a receiver node that generates the desired inference (estimation or detection) about unknown source parameters. We assume a homogeneous sensor signal field in which information about the source parameters is distributed in space (across sensors) and time in an independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) manner. Our study characterizes the asymptotic performance of an identical source-channel mapping for i.i.d. sensor observation data in which the same encoder is used at all the nodes. This scheme generalizes many existing methods including uncoded transmission and type-based multiple access. Sufficient conditions are obtained under which our identical mapping approach achieves the genie-aided scaling law (in the number of nodes) associated with a noiseless channel, even when the nodes transmit with asymptotically vanishing power. Our analysis also elucidates the critical impact of channel state information on the achievable performance. In particular, it identifies scenarios in which identical mapping fails and a simple nonidentical mapping scheme is shown to improve performance. Numerical examples are provided to illustrate the theoretical principles derived in the paper.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/4244638/04244703.pdf","startPage":"3445","endPage":"3455","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2007.894412","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2007.894412","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4244638","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4244703","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Decentralized Inference Over Multiple-Access Channels","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wireless sensor networks","Sensor phenomena and characterization","Fading","Statistical distributions","Sufficient conditions","Information analysis","Performance analysis","Channel state information","Decision theory","Sensor fusion"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel coding","fading channels","multi-access systems","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sensor networks","nonidentical mapping","channel state information","genie-aided scaling law","uncoded transmission","identical source-channel mapping","homogeneous sensor signal field","joint source-channel coding","fading channel","multiple-access channel","sensor networksdecentralized inference"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Decentralized inference","identical mapping","sensor networks","the method of types","uncoded transmission"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4244703/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 June 2007","displayDocTitle":"Decentralized Inference Over Multiple-Access Channels","volume":"55","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/4244703/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2007","accessionNumber":"9591549","dateOfInsertion":"18 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Decentralized Inference Over Multiple-Access Channels","sourcePdf":"55tsp07-liu-pt1.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.142554S","chronDate":"July  2007","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"4244638","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"4244638","articleId":"4244703","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4244705,"authors":[{"name":"Liya Thomas","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Blacksburg, VA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/4244641/4244705/4244705-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Liya Thomas (S'04) received the B.S. degree in computer science from Fudan University, Shanghai, China, in 1988 and the M.S. degree in computer science from West Virginia University, Morgantown, in 1993.

At every stage of wood processing, there is a potential for improving value and recovery with knowledge of the location, size, shape, and type of log defects. This paper deals with a new method that processes hardwood laser-scanned surface data for defect detection. The detection method is based on robust circle fitting applied to scanned cross-section data sets recorded along the log length. It can be observed that these data sets have missing data and include large outliers induced by loose bark that dangles from the log trunk. Because of that and because of the nonlinearity of the circle model, which presents both additive and nonadditive errors, we initiated a new robust generalized M-estimator, for which the residuals are standardized via scale estimates calculated by means of projection statistics and incorporated in the Huber objective function, yielding a bounded influence method. Our projection statistics are based on the 2-D radial vectors instead of the row vectors of the Jacobian matrix as advocated in the literature dealing with linear regression. These radial distances allow us to develop algorithms aimed at pinpointing large surface rises and depressions from the contour image levels, and thereby, locating severe external defects having at least a height of 0.5 in and a diameter of 5 in.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4244641","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2007.894262","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/4244641/04244705.pdf","startPage":"3568","endPage":"3576","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2007.894262","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Robust GM-Estimator for the Automated Detection of External Defects on Barked Hardwood Logs and Stems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2007","displayDocTitle":"A Robust GM-Estimator for the Automated Detection of External Defects on Barked Hardwood Logs and Stems","volume":"55","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/4244705/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 2007","accessionNumber":"9591521","dateOfInsertion":"18 June 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4244705/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Robust GM-Estimator for the Automated Detection of External Defects on Barked Hardwood Logs and Stems","sourcePdf":"55tsp07-lthomas-pt2.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.086526S","chronDate":"July  2007","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"4244641","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"4244641","articleId":"4244705","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4244706,"authors":[{"name":"Wing-Kin Ma","affiliation":["Institute of Communications Engineering and Department of Electrical Engineering, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/4244638/4244706/4244706-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Wing-Kin Ma (M'01) received the B.Eng. degree (first-class hons.) in electrical and electronic engineering from the University of Portsmouth, Portsmouth, U.K., in 1995, and the M.Phil. and Ph.D. degrees, both in electronic engineering, from the Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK), Hong Kong, in 1997 and 2001, respectively.","Since 2005, he has been an Assistant Professor with the Department of Electrical Engineering and the Institute of Communications Engineering, the National Tsing Hua University, Taiwan.

Recent work has revealed that for the orthogonal STBCs (OSTBCs), their special code structures can be exploited to formulate highly effective blind ML-based algorithms. Attracted by this realization merit, this paper investigates the blind ML identifiability of OSTBCs, with an emphasis on the binary PSK (BPSK) and quaternary PSK (QPSK) constellations. We find a class of OSTBCs, called the nonrotatable OSTBCs, that can be uniquely identified up to a sign (UIUTS) almost surely under a few mild assumptions. For example, for an independently distributed Rayleigh channel with any number of receiver antennas, a nonrotatable OSTBC can be UIUTS with probability 1. While this identifiability looks appealing already, we further examine a subclass of nonrotatable OSTBCs, called the nonintersecting subspace (NIS) OSTBCs. We prove that NIS-OSTBCs are UIUTS for any nonzero channel. However, NIS-OSTBCs are not available in the existing literature. To fill this gap, we devise a code construction procedure that can convert any (BPSK or QPSK) OSTBC to an NIS-OSTBC.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2007.894394","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/4244638/04244706.pdf","startPage":"3312","endPage":"3324","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2007.894394","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4244638","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Blind ML Detection of Orthogonal Space-Time Block Codes: Identifiability and Code Construction","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4244706","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 June 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4244706/","displayDocTitle":"Blind ML Detection of Orthogonal Space-Time Block Codes: Identifiability and Code Construction","volume":"55","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 2007","accessionNumber":"9591550","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4244706/","dateOfInsertion":"18 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Blind ML Detection of Orthogonal Space-Time Block Codes: Identifiability and Code Construction","sourcePdf":"55tsp07-ma-pt1.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.09273S","chronDate":"July  2007","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"4244638","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"40","xplore-issue":"4244638","articleId":"4244706","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4244711,"authors":[{"name":"Yanxin Na","affiliation":["Wireless Communications Research Laboratory (WiCoRe), University of Texas, Dallas, Richardson, TX, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/4244641/4244711/4244711-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yanxin Na (M'05) was born in Shenyang, China, in 1972.

To ensure the quality of service (QoS) required by the delay-sensitive and bandwidth intensive multimedia data for these applications, efficient resource (bandwidth) management becomes paramount. We propose to deploy the well-known game theoretic concept of bargaining to allocate the bandwidth fairly and optimally among multiple collaborative users. Specifically, we consider two bargaining solutions for our resource management problem: the Nash bargaining solution (NBS) and the Kalai-Smorodinsky bargaining solution (KSBS). We provide interpretations for the two investigated bargaining solutions for multiuser resource allocation: the NBS can be used to maximize the system utility, while the KSBS ensures that all users incur the same utility penalty relative to the maximum achievable utility. The bargaining strategies and solutions are implemented in the network using a resource manager, which explicitly considers the application-specific distortion for the bandwidth allocation. We show that the bargaining solutions exhibit important properties (axioms) that can be used for effective multimedia resource allocation. Moreover, we propose several criteria for determining bargaining powers for these solutions, which enable us to provide additional flexibility in choosing solution by taking into consideration the visual quality impact, the deployed spatiotemporal resolutions, etc. We also determine the complexity of these solutions for our application and quantify the performance of the proposed bargaining-based resource strategies for different scenarios.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2007.893755","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/4244638/04244720.pdf","startPage":"3496","endPage":"3511","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2007.893755","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4244638","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bargaining Strategies for Networked Multimedia Resource Management","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4244720","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 June 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4244720/","displayDocTitle":"Bargaining Strategies for Networked Multimedia Resource Management","volume":"55","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 2007","accessionNumber":"9591555","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4244720/","dateOfInsertion":"18 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bargaining Strategies for Networked Multimedia Resource Management","sourcePdf":"55tsp07-park-pt1.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.139768S","chronDate":"July  2007","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"4244638","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"121","xplore-issue":"4244638","articleId":"4244720","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4244724,"authors":[{"name":"Daniel J.

In this paper, we investigate several low-rank beam- forming techniques, and we also propose a new beamformer that we refer to as the indirect dominant mode rejection (IDMR). We analyze the degradation in the output SINR caused by residual cross correlations embedded in the sampled covariance matrix due to low sample support. The IDMR beamformer is based on a parametric estimate of the covariance matrix, in which any cross correlation is canceled out. Simulations reveal that the IDMR beamformer yields a dramatic improvement in output SINR relative to the conjugate gradient (CG), principal component inverse (PCI), and dominant mode rejection (DMR) beamformers. In our investigation of the low-rank CG beamformer, we address the issue of whether the unity gain constraint in the look direction should be enforced a priori via the use of a blocking matrix or effected a posteriori through simple scaling of the beamforming vector. Remarkably, it is proven that the two methods yield exactly the same low-rank beamformer at each and every rank.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2007.893926","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/4244638/04244725.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4244638","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2007.893926","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","startPage":"3283","endPage":"3293","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Indirect Dominant Mode Rejection: A Solution to Low Sample Support Beamforming","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4244725","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 June 2007","displayDocTitle":"Indirect Dominant Mode Rejection: A Solution to Low Sample Support Beamforming","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4244725/","volume":"55","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/4244725/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2007","accessionNumber":"9591556","dateOfInsertion":"18 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Indirect Dominant Mode Rejection: A Solution to Low Sample Support Beamforming","sourcePdf":"55tsp07-santos-pt1.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.082891S","chronDate":"July  2007","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"4244638","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"4244638","articleId":"4244725","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4244727,"authors":[{"name":"Serdar Sezginer","affiliation":["SUPELEC, Gif-sur-Yvette, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/4244641/4244727/4244727-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Serdar Sezginer (S'99\u2013M'07) was born in Bandirma, Turkey, in 1977.

Next, we bring to the fore the training strategies which minimize the asymptotic performance bounds and which are, therefore, likely to lead to accurate estimates of the parameters. In particular, for a given user, it is shown that accurate frequency offset estimates are likely to be obtained by introducing relevant correlation between training sequences sent at different antennas. On the other hand, accurate channel estimation is achieved when training sequences sent at different antennas are uncorrelated.

Streams of Diracs and piecewise polynomials are the examples of such signals, and thus are known as signals with finite rate of innovation (FRI). We know that the classical (\"band-limited sine\") sampling theory does not enable perfect reconstruction of such signals from their samples since they are not band-limited. However, the recent results on FRI sampling suggest that it is possible to sample and perfectly reconstruct such nonband-limited signals using a rich class of kernels. In this paper, we extend those results in higher dimensions using compactly supported kernels that reproduce polynomials (satisfy Strang-Fix conditions). In fact, the polynomial reproduction property of the kernel makes it possible to obtain the continuous moments of the signal from its samples. Using these moments and the annihilating filter method (Prony's method), the innovative part of the signal, and therefore, the signal itself is perfectly reconstructed. In particular, we present local (directional-derivatives-based) and global (complex-moments-based, Radon-transform-based) sampling schemes for classes of FRI signals such as sets of Diracs, bilevel, and planar polygons, quadrature domains (e.g., circles, ellipses, and cardioids), 2D polynomials with polygonal boundaries, and \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">n</i>\n-dimensional Diracs and convex polytopes.

The evanescent component can be further decomposed into two orthogonal components called type 1 evanescent and type 2 evanescent. Assuming that the 3D image volume is a finite realization of a discrete homogeneous stochastic process, the 3D texture field can be uniquely represented as a sum of four mutually orthogonal components with different spectral properties. The aim of this paper is to present new parametric models able to describe both the spectral support and spatial characteristics of each component.

To be consistent with ARQ, our goal is to progressively design the optimal transmission precoder and receiver feedback system to jointly minimize the mean square error (MSE) under the assumption of perfect feedback. We consider both zero-forcing and minimum MSE (MMSE) decoder as joint ARQ receivers. Unlike in single transmission design, joint ARQ receivers cannot change previous precoders.

The PMU-OFDM system can reduce multiaccess interference (MAI) due to the carrier frequency offset (CFO) to a negligible amount by preceding the data of each user with a codeword selected from either even or odd Hadamard-Walsh codes. The performance of the PMU-OFDM system in a mobile environment, where the channel response varies within one OFDM symbol due to the Doppler effect, is evaluated in this paper. It is shown by analysis and simulation that the use of even or odd Hadamard-Walsh codewords can greatly reduce the MAI effect due to the Doppler effect as well. Generally, all Hadamard-Walsh codewords except for the all-one codeword result in considerable suppression of intercarrier interference (ICI) induced by the Doppler effect. Furthermore, we discuss codeword priority schemes to minimize ICI as much as possible. Finally, simulations results are given to demonstrate the advantage of PMU-OFDM over OFDMA with a codeword priority scheme in the Doppler environment. We show that the PMU-OFDM system with odd Hadamard-Walsh codewords outperforms a half-loaded OFDMA system in a mobile environment.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2007.894260","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/4244641/04244736.pdf","startPage":"3787","endPage":"3799","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2007.894260","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4244641","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Approximately MAI-Free Multiaccess OFDM System in Fast Time-Varying Channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4244736","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 June 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4244736/","displayDocTitle":"An Approximately MAI-Free Multiaccess OFDM System in Fast Time-Varying Channels","volume":"55","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 2007","accessionNumber":"9591527","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4244736/","dateOfInsertion":"18 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Approximately MAI-Free Multiaccess OFDM System in Fast Time-Varying Channels","sourcePdf":"55tsp07-tadjpour-pt2.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.125038S","chronDate":"July  2007","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"4244641","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"4244641","articleId":"4244736","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4244738,"authors":[{"name":"Ran Tao","affiliation":["Electronic Engineering Department, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Ran","lastName":"Tao","id":"37289461800"},{"name":"Bing-Zhao Li","affiliation":["Mathematics Department, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Bing-Zhao","lastName":"Li","id":"37292488900"},{"name":"Yue Wang","affiliation":["Electronic Engineering Department, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yue","lastName":"Wang","id":"37293647600"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1053-587X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0476"}],"articleNumber":"4244738","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":75,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":875},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Spectral analysis","Nonuniform sampling","Sampling methods","Fourier transforms","Chirp","Integral equations","Computer applications","Distributed computing","Signal processing","Radio access networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Fourier transforms","signal reconstruction","signal representation","signal sampling","spectral analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discrete fractional spectrum","sampling offsets","chirp rate","chirp signals","spectral representation","periodic nonuniform sampling","fractional Fourier domain","spectral analysis"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Chirp signal","fractional Fourier transform (FrFT)","nonstationary signal","periodic nonuniform sampling","spectral analysis"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4244738","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2007.893931","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","abstract":"Nonuniform sampling occurs in many applications due to imperfect timebase or random events.

This correspondence is to explore the spectral properties of periodic nonuniformly sampled signals associated with the fractional Fourier transform. First, based on the uniform fractional Fourier transform kernel, the general spectral representation of periodic nonuniformly sampled signals has been derived. Second, detailed analysis of periodic nonuniformly sampled chirp signals in the fractional Fourier domain have been performed. The results can be used to estimate the chirp rate and the sampling offsets. Finally, a more simple relationship between the discrete fractional spectrum of periodic nonuniformly sampled signals and the continuous spectrum has been obtained. Based on this relationship, the original continuous spectrum can be reconstructed from periodic nonuniformly sampled signals in fractional Fourier domain.

We propose partial BSS methods, which separate supposedly nonstationary sources of interest (while keeping residual components for the other, supposedly stationary, ldquonoiserdquo sources). These methods are based on the general differential BSS concept that we introduced before. In the instantaneous case, the approach proposed in this paper consists of a differential extension of the FastICA method (which does not apply to underdetermined mixtures). In the convolutive case, we extend our recent time-domain fast fixed-point C-FICA algorithm to underdetermined mixtures. Both proposed approaches thus keep the attractive features of the FastICA and C-FICA methods. Our approaches are based on differential sphering processes, followed by the optimization of the differential nonnormalized kurtosis that we introduce in this paper. Experimental tests show that these differential algorithms are much more robust to noise sources than the standard FastICA and C-FICA algorithms.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2007.894243","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/4244641/04244739.pdf","startPage":"3717","endPage":"3729","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2007.894243","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4244641","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Differential Fast Fixed-Point Algorithms for Underdetermined Instantaneous and Convolutive Partial Blind Source Separation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4244739","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 June 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4244739/","displayDocTitle":"Differential Fast Fixed-Point Algorithms for Underdetermined Instantaneous and Convolutive Partial Blind Source Separation","volume":"55","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 2007","accessionNumber":"9591528","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4244739/","dateOfInsertion":"18 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Differential Fast Fixed-Point Algorithms for Underdetermined Instantaneous and Convolutive Partial Blind Source Separation","sourcePdf":"55tsp07-thomas-pt2.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.092844S","chronDate":"July  2007","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"4244641","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"4244641","articleId":"4244739","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4244743,"authors":[{"name":"K.

According to this method, the sensors distribution parameters are estimated via the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm for GMM parameter estimation and the separation matrix is estimated by applying nonorthogonal joint diagonalization of the estimated GMM covariance matrices. The second proposed method is also a ML-based approach. According to this method, the distribution parameters of the prewhitened sensors are estimated via the EM algorithm for GMM parameter estimation and a unitary separation matrix is estimated by applying orthogonal joint diagonalization of the estimated GMM covariance matrices. It is shown that estimation of the sensors distribution parameters amounts to obtaining a tight lower bound on the log-likelihood of the separation matrix, and that the joint diagonalization of the estimated GMM covariance matrices amounts to maximization of the obtained tight lower bound.

In this paper, the issue of joint transmitter-receiver filter design is addressed for shortening multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) ISI channels. A frequency-domain approach is adopted for the transceiver design which is effectively equivalent to an infinite-length time-domain design. A practical space-frequency waterfilling algorithm is also provided. It is demonstrated that the channel shortening equalizer designed according to the time-domain approach suffers from an error-floor effect. However, the proposed techniques are shown to overcome this problem and outperform the time-domain channel shortening filter design. We also demonstrate that the proposed transceiver design can be considered as a MIMO broadband beamformer with constraints on the time-domain multipath length. Hence, a significant diversity gain could also be achieved by choosing strong eigenmodes of the MIMO channel. It is also found that the proposed frequency-domain methods have considerably low computational complexity as compared with their time-domain counterparts.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2007.894231","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/4244641/04244745.pdf","startPage":"3851","endPage":"3866","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2007.894231","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4244641","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint Transceiver Design for MIMO Channel Shortening","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4244745","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 June 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4244745/","displayDocTitle":"Joint Transceiver Design for MIMO Channel Shortening","volume":"55","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 2007","accessionNumber":"9591531","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4244745/","dateOfInsertion":"18 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint Transceiver Design for MIMO Channel Shortening","sourcePdf":"55tsp07-toker-pt2.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.143966S","chronDate":"July  2007","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"4244641","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"4244641","articleId":"4244745","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4244748,"authors":[{"name":"Parvathinathan Venkitasubramaniam","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/4244641/4244748/4244748-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Parvathinathan Venkitasubramaniam (S'03) received the B.Tech. degree from the Department of Electrical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology, Madras, in 2002.

In particular, we design deterministic scalar quantizers to maximize the minimum asymptotic relative efficiency (ARE) between quantized and unquantized ML estimators. We first design identical quantizers using the class of score-function quantizers (SFQ). We show that the structure of SFQs generally depend on the parameter value, but can be expressed as thresholds on the sufficient statistic for a large class of distributions. We provide a convergent iterative algorithm to obtain the best SFQ that maximizes the minimum ARE for distributions of that class. We compare the performance of the optimal SFQ with a general quantizer designed without making any restrictions on the structure. This general quantizer is hard to implement due to lack of structure, but is optimal if the iterative design algorithm does not encounter local minima. Through numerical simulations, we illustrate that the two quantizers designed are identical. In other words, the optimal quantizer structure is that of an SFQ. For a distributed estimation setup, designing identical quantizers is shown to be suboptimal. We, therefore, propose a joint multiple quantizer design algorithm based on a person-by-person optimization technique employing the SFQ structure.

The proposed method relies on the channel order diversity of the finite impulse response-MIMO channel, and it does not make any assumption about the spectra or the finite alphabet property of the sources. Assuming that the lengths of the single-input multiple-output channels are known or estimated a priori, it is able to extract the sources up to a scale and rotation matrix ambiguity, which only affects to those sources associated to single-input multiple-output (SIMO) channels with equal lengths. Unlike previously proposed techniques, the method described in this paper obtains the equalizers and the best linear combination of their outputs in a single step and, thus, optimally. The reformulation of the proposed method as a set of nested canonical correlation analysis problems is exploited to obtain efficient batch and adaptive equalization algorithms.

The cardinalized PHD (CPHD) recursion is a generalization of the PHD recursion, which jointly propagates the posterior intensity and the posterior cardinality distribution. In general, the CPHD recursion is computationally intractable. This paper proposes a closed-form solution to the CPHD recursion under linear Gaussian assumptions on the target dynamics and birth process. Based on this solution, an effective multitarget tracking algorithm is developed. Extensions of the proposed closed-form recursion to accommodate nonlinear models are also given using linearization and unscented transform techniques. The proposed CPHD implementations not only sidestep the need to perform data association found in traditional methods, but also dramatically improve the accuracy of individual state estimates as well as the variance of the estimated number of targets when compared to the standard PHD filter. Our implementations only have a cubic complexity, but simulations suggest favorable performance compared to the standard Joint Probabilistic Data Association (JPDA) filter which has a nonpolynomial complexity.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analytic Implementations of the Cardinalized Probability Hypothesis Density Filter","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2007.894241","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/4244641/04244751.pdf","startPage":"3553","endPage":"3567","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2007.894241","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4244641","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4244751","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4244751/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 June 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2007","displayDocTitle":"Analytic Implementations of the Cardinalized Probability Hypothesis Density Filter","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"55","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/4244751/","dateOfInsertion":"18 June 2007","publicationDate":"July 2007","accessionNumber":"9744227","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analytic Implementations of the Cardinalized Probability Hypothesis Density Filter","sourcePdf":"55tsp07-vo-pt2.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.114122S","chronDate":"July  2007","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"4244641","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"466","xplore-issue":"4244641","articleId":"4244751","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-28"},{"_id":4244752,"authors":[{"name":"Haibo Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, McMaster University, Hamilton, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Haibo","lastName":"Wang","id":"37559099000"},{"name":"Thia Kirubarajan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, McMaster University, Hamilton, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Thia","lastName":"Kirubarajan","id":"37268358200"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1053-587X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0476"}],"articleNumber":"4244752","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":232},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Array signal processing","Feedback","Downlink","Channel state information","Feeds","Mutual information","Base stations","MIMO","Time-varying channels","Signal to noise ratio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna accessories","array signal processing","diversity reception","feedback","Monte Carlo methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Monte Carlo simulation","single-antenna receivers","base station","multiuser diversity","wireless communication systems","multiple-input-single-output","MISO downlink transmission","partial feedback","random unitary beamforming"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Downlink","multiple antennas","multiuser diversity","random unitary beamforming","scheduling"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4244752","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2007.894421","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","abstract":"In this paper, we study the problem of downlink transmission in multiple-input-single-output (MISO) wireless communication systems using multiuser diversity. There are antennas at the base station (BS) and single-antenna receivers. The performance of multiuser diversity depends on the number of users that have independent channel realizations. It is well known that increasing the number of users improves the performance at the expense of increasing feedback that is proportional to the number of users. For sufficiently large K, the capacity scales like M log log K. When K is large, increasing feedback limits practical applications of the multiuser diversity. Our approach is to reduce the feedback by selecting a threshold for the l\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">infin</sub>\n-norm of the normalized cross-correlation (||z\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">k</sub>\n||\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">infin</sub>\n) between the users' channel and the beamforming matrix based on the random unitary beamforming.

This generalizes the standard sparse representation problem to the case where multiple responses exist that were putatively generated by the same small subset of features. Ideally, the associated sparse generating weights should be recovered, which can have physical significance in many applications (e.g., source localization). The generic solution to this problem is intractable and, therefore, approximate procedures are sought. Based on the concept of automatic relevance determination, this paper uses an empirical Bayesian prior to estimate a convenient posterior distribution over candidate basis vectors. This particular approximation enforces a common sparsity profile and consistently places its prominent posterior mass on the appropriate region of weight-space necessary for simultaneous sparse recovery. The resultant algorithm is then compared with multiple response extensions of matching pursuit, basis pursuit, FOCUSS, and Jeffreys prior-based Bayesian methods, finding that it often outperforms the others. Additional motivation for this particular choice of cost function is also provided, including the analysis of global and local minima and a variational derivation that highlights the similarities and differences between the proposed algorithm and previous approaches.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2007.894265","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2007.894265","startPage":"3704","endPage":"3716","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/4244641/04244754.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4244641","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Empirical Bayesian Strategy for Solving the Simultaneous Sparse Approximation Problem","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4244754/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 June 2007","displayDocTitle":"An Empirical Bayesian Strategy for Solving the Simultaneous Sparse Approximation Problem","volume":"55","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"18 June 2007","accessionNumber":"9591535","publicationDate":"July 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4244754/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Empirical Bayesian Strategy for Solving the Simultaneous Sparse Approximation Problem","sourcePdf":"55tsp07-wipf-pt2.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.124992S","chronDate":"July  2007","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"4244641","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"482","xplore-issue":"4244641","articleId":"4244754","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4244757,"authors":[{"name":"Youshen Xia","affiliation":["College of Mathematics and Computer Science, Fuzhou University, Fuzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/4244638/4244757/4244757-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Youshen Xia (M'96\u2013SM'01) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in computational mathematics and applied software from Nanjing University, Nanjing, China, in 1982 and 1989, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in computational intelligence from The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, in 2000.","His current research interests include applications of recurrent neural networks for constrained optimization, signal and image processing, data fusion and data association, and system identification."]},"firstName":"Youshen","lastName":"Xia","id":"37085669186"},{"name":"Mohamed S.

Integrated in the design of MAC schemes are two key physical-layer parameters: the channel state and the residual energy of each sensor. The individual and collective impacts of incorporating these parameters in MAC design on network lifetime are studied. We show that a lifetime-maximizing protocol should dynamically trade off the channel state information (CSI) with the residual energy information (REI) according to the age of the network. Specifically, lifetime-maximizing protocols should be more opportunistic by prioritizing sensors with better channels for transmission when the network is young and more conservative by favoring sensors with more residual energies when the network is old. Following this general design principle, we propose a dynamic protocol for lifetime maximization (DPLM) that exploits local information of both channel state and residual energy. Analytical and simulation results are provided to demonstrate the dynamic property and the asymptotic optimality of DPLM: its relative performance loss as compared to the performance limit defined by the optimal centralized protocol using global CSI and REI diminishes as the initial energy of each sensor increases.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4244758/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 June 2007","volume":"55","issue":"7","accessionNumber":"9744231","publicationDate":"July 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4244758/","dateOfInsertion":"18 June 2007","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"An Integrated Approach to Energy-Aware Medium Access for Wireless Sensor Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Integrated Approach to Energy-Aware Medium Access for Wireless Sensor Networks","sourcePdf":"55tsp07-ychen-pt1.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.109196S","chronDate":"July  2007","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"4244638","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"55","xplore-issue":"4244638","articleId":"4244758","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4244762,"authors":[{"name":"Yi Sun","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, City College,City College and Graduate Center, City University of New York, NY, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/4244638/4244762/4244762-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yi Sun (M'95) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electrical engineering from the Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China, in 1982 and 1985, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from the University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, in 1997.","From 1985 to 1993, he was a Lecturer at the Institute of Image Processing and Pattern Recognition, Shanghai Jiao Tong University.

The number of users and spreading gain tend to infinity with their ratio converging to a constant. An approach to exploitation of retransmission diversity (RD) is proposed that first eliminates the interference signals caused by the previously successfully detected packets and then jointly utilizes all received signals in packet detection. Performance of two schemes is analyzed: (i) random spreading with RD exploitation and (ii) randomly selected but fixed spreading for each packet with RD exploitation, and compared with the conventional scheme that RD is not exploited. Lower bounds on the limit signal-to-interference ratios (SIRs) of the two schemes are obtained. Throughput, packet delay, transmission time, and waiting time as well as spectral efficiency in the limit system are obtained as a function of medium access control. The analytical results are confirmed by simulations. Other schemes that increase RD by changing order of transmitted packets are also discussed. Optimization of media access control (MAC) is studied. In terms of maximization of spectral efficiency and simplicity of MAC, scheme (i) is the most favorable out of all the schemes.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/4244638/04244762.pdf","startPage":"3471","endPage":"3483","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2007.894393","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2007.894393","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4244638","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4244762","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Retransmission Diversity in Large CDMA Random Access Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiaccess communication","Media Access Protocol","Base stations","H infinity control","Interference elimination","Signal detection","Performance analysis","Throughput","Delay effects","Analytical models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","diversity reception","interference (signal)","spectral analysis","spread spectrum communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["retransmission diversity","CDMA random access systems","base station","CDMA channel","packet detection","signal-to-interference ratios","packet delay","spectral efficiency","medium access control"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cross-layer design","CDMA","spread spectrum communications"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4244762/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 June 2007","displayDocTitle":"Retransmission Diversity in Large CDMA Random Access Systems","volume":"55","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/4244762/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2007","accessionNumber":"9591564","dateOfInsertion":"18 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Retransmission Diversity in Large CDMA Random Access Systems","sourcePdf":"55tsp07-ysun-pt1.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.111777S","chronDate":"July  2007","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"4244638","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"4244638","articleId":"4244762","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4244763,"authors":[{"name":"Keyvan Zarifi","affiliation":["Communication Systems Group, Darmstadt University of Technology, Darmstadt, Germany"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/4244638/4244763/4244763-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Keyvan Zarifi (S'04) received the B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees, both in electrical engineering, from the University of Tehran, Tehran, Iran, in 1997 and 2000, respectively.","He is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree at the Department of Communication Systems, Darmstadt University of Technology, Darmstadt, Germany.

This algorithm gives a model of human visual system (HVS) in NSCT domain, exploiting the masking characteristics of HVS to embed watermark adaptively. NSCT has the characteristics of multi-resolution, localization, multi-directionality and anisotropy. Thus NSCT is much more similar to the information processing mechanism of the HVS than wavelet transform. Additionally, NSCT is a redundant transform, which can increase robustness to additive noise processing, and watermark can be considered as noise, it can be assumed that this algorithm can outperform the algorithm in wavelet domain. This assume is confirmed by experiments , compared to the algorithm in wavelet domain, this algorithm can embed much more watermark data, and the watermark is much more robust, achieved the best compromise between robustness and invisibility.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Watermarking","Computed tomography","Wavelet domain","Wavelet transforms","Noise robustness","Additive noise","Filter bank","Humans","Visual system","Anisotropic magnetoresistance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image colour analysis","image resolution","watermarking"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital watermarking","nonsampled contourlet transform","human visual system","multiresolution","wavelet domain","image processing domain"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Contourlet transform","Non-Sampled Contourlet Transform","HVS","Digital watermark"]}],"doi":"10.1109/IWASID.2007.373714","publicationTitle":"2007 International Workshop on Anti-Counterfeiting, Security and Identification (ASID)","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 International Workshop on Anti-Counterfeiting, Security and Identification (ASID)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4244765/4244766/04244800.pdf","startPage":"138","endPage":"141","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4244766","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IWASID.2007.373714","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Digital Watermarking based on Non-Sampled Contourlet Transform","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4244800","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Digital Watermarking based on Non-Sampled Contourlet Transform","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4244800/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4244800/","accessionNumber":"10089283","conferenceDate":"16-18 April 2007","dateOfInsertion":"18 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 April 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Digital Watermarking based on Non-Sampled Contourlet Transform","confLoc":"Xizmen, China","sourcePdf":"IWASID-00-34.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042306S","chronDate":"16-18 April 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4244765","isNumber":"4244766","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4244765","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"4244766","articleId":"4244800","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4244812,"authors":[{"name":"Xuetao Feng","affiliation":["Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy and Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xuetao","lastName":"Feng","id":"37654835600"},{"name":"Yangsheng Wang","affiliation":["Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy and Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yangsheng","lastName":"Wang","id":"37281430700"},{"name":"Yong Gao","affiliation":["Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy and Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yong","lastName":"Gao","id":"37291885900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-1035-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2163-5048"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2163-5056"}],"articleNumber":"4244812","dbTime":"38 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":85},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Lighting","Face recognition","Histograms","Image databases","Automation","Principal component analysis","Pattern recognition","Humans","Degradation","Image generation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["face recognition","principal component analysis","visual databases"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["local illumination normalization","face recognition","image preprocessing method","piecewise gamma transformation","piecewise histogram specification","uneven lighting condition","Yale face database","CMU PIE face database","PCA"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["pattern recognition","face recognition","image process"]}],"abstract":"This paper proposes a framework of illumination normalization algorithm and two new image preprocessing methods according to the framework: piecewise gamma transformation (PGT) and piecewise histogram specification (PHS).

The proposed adaptive algorithm is based only on second-order statistical(SOS) information and exploits the assumption that the source signals are not strictly spatial statistically independent, and temporal do not identical distributed too. Furthermore, the novel adaptive batch blind signal separation(BSS) method give an adaptive algorithm for correlated source signals. In order to get the ideal separation, the source signals must have different power spectra shapes. Simulation results for real image recordings show that the proposed algorithm has the ability to restore source signals, and its performance is comparable to that of the BSS algorithm such as AMUSE and JADE algorithm. The proposed algorithm is also shown to alleviate the limitation that the classic independent component analysis(ICA) algorithm can separate at most one Gaussian distributed source.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Semiblind Signal Separation Approach Using Temporal Structure of Sources","publicationTitle":"2007 International Workshop on Anti-Counterfeiting, Security and Identification (ASID)","doi":"10.1109/IWASID.2007.373752","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 International Workshop on Anti-Counterfeiting, Security and Identification (ASID)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4244765/4244766/04244838.pdf","startPage":"315","endPage":"318","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IWASID.2007.373752","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4244766","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4244838","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4244838/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 April 2007","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Semiblind Signal Separation Approach Using Temporal Structure of Sources","conferenceDate":"16-18 April 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4244838/","dateOfInsertion":"18 June 2007","publicationDate":"April 2007","accessionNumber":"10075867","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Semiblind Signal Separation Approach Using Temporal Structure of Sources","confLoc":"Xizmen, China","sourcePdf":"IWASID-00-72.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043116S","chronDate":"16-18 April 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4244765","isNumber":"4244766","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4244765","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4244766","articleId":"4244838","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4244839,"authors":[{"name":"Fang Xu","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Underwater Acoustic Communication and Marine Information Technology, Ministry of Education, Xiamen University, Xiamen, Fujian, China"],"firstName":"Fang","lastName":"Xu","id":"37401235400"},{"name":"Ru Xu","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Underwater Acoustic Communication and Marine Information Technology, Ministry of Education, Xiamen University, Xiamen, Fujian, China"],"firstName":"Ru","lastName":"Xu","id":"37392566100"},{"name":"Haixin Sun","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Underwater Acoustic Communication and Marine Information Technology, Ministry of Education, Xiamen University, Xiamen, Fujian, China"],"firstName":"Haixin","lastName":"Sun","id":"37403470500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-1035-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2163-5048"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2163-5056"}],"articleNumber":"4244839","dbTime":"20 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":221},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interferometry","OFDM","Pulse shaping methods","Frequency domain analysis","Peak to average power ratio","Fast Fourier transforms","Proposals","Pulse generation","Signal generators","Signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fast Fourier transforms","frequency-domain analysis","interferometry","matrix algebra","OFDM modulation","pulse shaping","signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["carrier interferometry orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","CI-OFDM signals","pulse shaping technique","frequency domain analysis","inverse fast Fourier transform","linear transform matrix","signal processing efficiency"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Pulse Shaping","IFFT","Carrier Interferometry (CI)","CI/OFDM"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents a novel design of carrier interferometry (CI) spreading codes by Using inverse fast Fourier transform (IFFT) instead of linear transform matrix.

In this work, a Si-based test carrier was used for characterization of ultra-fine pitch micro C4s. Successful assembly and rework of die with 11,892 micro C4s were demonstrated. The micro C4 contact resistance was measured for various pad geometries. The mechanical shear force was characterized for several variables including contact pad area, pad shape, and shear direction. When joined onto pads with reduced size, the micro C4s were sheared without significant damage. Therefore, a carrier with reduced-size bonding pads can be utilized as a platform for functional test and burn-in followed by chip removal to create know-good-die (KGD). These high I/O KGD can be joined to a multi-chip module, silicon package or stacked to create chip stacks and tested to create known-good-modules (KGM) or known-good-die-stacks (KGDS). This specialized high I/O silicon carrier with full area array, reduced-area bonding pads is also referred to as a temporary chip attachment (TCA) substrate.","doi":"10.1109/ECTC.2007.373774","publicationTitle":"2007 Proceedings 57th Electronic Components and Technology Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 Proceedings 57th Electronic Components and Technology Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4249837/4249838/04249860.pdf","startPage":"42","endPage":"48","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ECTC.2007.373774","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4249838","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Assembly, Characterization, and Reworkability of Pb-free Ultra-Fine Pitch C4s for System-on-Package","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4249860","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 29 2007-June 1 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4249860/","displayDocTitle":"Assembly, Characterization, and Reworkability of Pb-free Ultra-Fine Pitch C4s for System-on-Package","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May-June 2007","accessionNumber":"9727378","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4249860/","conferenceDate":"29 May-1 June 2007","dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Assembly, Characterization, and Reworkability of Pb-free Ultra-Fine Pitch C4s for System-on-Package","confLoc":"Sparks, NV, USA","sourcePdf":"ECTC-00-22.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.092426S","chronDate":"May 29 2007-June 1 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4249837","isNumber":"4249838","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4249837","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"4249838","articleId":"4249860","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4249897,"authors":[{"name":"Beth Keser","affiliation":["Freescale Semiconductor, Inc., Tempe, AZ, USA"],"firstName":"Beth","lastName":"Keser","id":"37445007900"},{"name":"Craig Amrine","affiliation":["Freescale Semiconductor, Inc., Tempe, AZ, USA"],"firstName":"Craig","lastName":"Amrine","id":"37688684900"},{"name":"Trung Duong","affiliation":["Freescale Semiconductor, Inc., Tempe, AZ, USA"],"firstName":"Trung","lastName":"Duong","id":"37701573300"},{"name":"Owen Fay","affiliation":["Freescale Semiconductor, Inc., Tempe, AZ, USA"],"firstName":"Owen","lastName":"Fay","id":"37688685400"},{"name":"Scott Hayes","affiliation":["Freescale Semiconductor, Inc., Tempe, AZ, USA"],"firstName":"Scott","lastName":"Hayes","id":"37702433100"},{"name":"George Leal","affiliation":["Freescale Semiconductor, Inc., Tempe, AZ, USA"],"firstName":"George","lastName":"Leal","id":"37698990100"},{"name":"William Lytle","affiliation":["Freescale Semiconductor, Inc., Tempe, AZ, USA"],"firstName":"William","lastName":"Lytle","id":"37352198500"},{"name":"Doug Mitchell","affiliation":["Freescale Semiconductor, Inc., Tempe, AZ, USA"],"firstName":"Doug","lastName":"Mitchell","id":"37447362200"},{"name":"Robert Wenzel","affiliation":["Freescale Semiconductor, Inc., Tempe, AZ, USA"],"firstName":"Robert","lastName":"Wenzel","id":"37340415300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0984-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0985-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0569-5503"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2377-5726"}],"articleNumber":"4249897","dbTime":"38 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":79,"citationCountPatent":16,"totalDownloads":890},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Packaging","Routing","Flip chip","Costs","Large-scale systems","Assembly","Stress","Joining processes","Curing","Signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["chip scale packaging","integrated circuit interconnections"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["redistributed chip package","multilayer metal RCP panel","substrate-less embedded chip package","large scale assembly","device interconnect","ultralow K device compatibility","air-to-air thermal cycling","HAST"]}],"abstract":"The redistributed chip package (RCP) is a substrate-less embedded chip package that offers a low-cost, high performance, integrated alternative to current wirebond BGA and flip chip BGA packaging. Devices are encapsulated into panels while routing of signals, power, and ground is built directly on the panel. The RCP panel and signal build-up lowers the cost of the package by eliminating wafer bumping and substrates thereby enabling large scale assembly in panel form. The build-up provides better routing capabilities and better integration. Also, by eliminating bumping, the device interconnect is inherently Pb-free, and the stress of the package is reduced enabling ultra-low K device compatibility. The panel is created by attaching device active side down to a substrate, encapsulating and curing the devices, grinding to desired thickness, and then removing the substrate. Signal, power, and ground planes are created using redistribution-like processing.

Different interconnect metallurgies such as Cu/Ni/In, Cu/In and Cu/Sn were considered and the bonding conditions to optimize the bonding parameters were determined. The effect of intermetallic compound (IMC) formation on the mechanical properties of the joins is discussed. Unlike standard 100-micron C4 solder balls, very small solder volumes (<6 microns high) were investigated. The mechanical properties were evaluated by shear and impact shock testing, while scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and optical microscopy were used to study the morphology of the IMC layers in solder joins before and after annealing. It was found that Cu/Ni/In and Cu/In interconnections have slightly lower shear strength per bump. While these values were lower than the Cu/Sn joins, the Cu/Ni/In chips passed the impact shock test for a simulated heat sink mass of 27g/cm\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n.

Many TSV approaches that have been demonstrated are application specific; and there is a great need for generic solutions. This work describes the design, fabrication and characterization of a TSV technology for silicon substrates where the interconnects are fabricated typically after standard CMOS processing and can be applied to any silicon based technology. This so-called 3D Wafer Level Packaging (3D-WLP) technology die stacking is based on a the thinning first, via last approach: the via is fabricated from the backside of a thinned wafer. Plasma etching of the wafer is used to achieve sloped profile which allows the conformal deposition of the dielectric layer and copper seed metallization. The vias are isolated from the substrate using polymer dielectrics; and spray coating of photoresist is used to pattern the dielectric within the vias. Electrical connection between the front and the back of the wafer is achieved by partial filling of the vias with copper. All processes employed in the fabrication of sloped through wafer vias are performed using standard wafer handling and at low temperature (< 250\u00b0C) for post CMOS compatibility. Various dimensions of TSVs are fabricated and electrically characterized by four point measurements. The measurements and calculations on daisy chains connecting a number vias in series show that the via resistance is in the range of 20-30m\u03a9 depending on the via size. We believe that this generic 3D-WLP via approach is suitable for many 3D applications.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sloped Through Wafer Vias for 3D Wafer Level Packaging","publicationTitle":"2007 Proceedings 57th Electronic Components and Technology Conference","doi":"10.1109/ECTC.2007.373865","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 Proceedings 57th Electronic Components and Technology Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4249837/4249838/04249951.pdf","startPage":"643","endPage":"647","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ECTC.2007.373865","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4249838","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4249951","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4249951/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 29 2007-June 1 2007","displayDocTitle":"Sloped Through Wafer Vias for 3D Wafer Level Packaging","conferenceDate":"29 May-1 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4249951/","dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2007","publicationDate":"May-June 2007","accessionNumber":"9727418","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sloped Through Wafer Vias for 3D Wafer Level Packaging","confLoc":"Sparks, NV, USA","sourcePdf":"ECTC-00-113.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041971S","chronDate":"May 29 2007-June 1 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4249837","isNumber":"4249838","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4249837","citationCount":"35","xplore-issue":"4249838","articleId":"4249951","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4249961,"authors":[{"name":"Torsten Wipiejewski","affiliation":["Firecomms Limited, Cork, Ireland"],"firstName":"Torsten","lastName":"Wipiejewski","id":"37283306500"},{"name":"Geoffrey Duggan","affiliation":["Firecomms Limited, Cork, Ireland"],"firstName":"Geoffrey","lastName":"Duggan","id":"37316847000"},{"name":"Dave Barrow","affiliation":["Firecomms Limited, Cork, Ireland"],"firstName":"Dave","lastName":"Barrow","id":"37388204800"},{"name":"Brian McGarvey","affiliation":["Firecomms Limited, Cork, Ireland"],"firstName":"Brian","lastName":"McGarvey","id":"38184843600"},{"name":"Vincent Hung","affiliation":["Firecomms Limited, Cork, Ireland"],"firstName":"Vincent","lastName":"Hung","id":"37426300100"},{"name":"Tim Calvert","affiliation":["Firecomms Limited, Cork, Ireland"],"firstName":"Tim","lastName":"Calvert","id":"37433624000"},{"name":"Markus Maute","affiliation":["Firecomms Limited, Cork, Ireland"],"firstName":"Markus","lastName":"Maute","id":"37270525000"},{"name":"John Lambkin","affiliation":["Firecomms Limited, Cork, Ireland"],"firstName":"John","lastName":"Lambkin","id":"37319649100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0984-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0985-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0569-5503"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2377-5726"}],"articleNumber":"4249961","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":169},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Red VCSELs for POF Data Transmission and Optical Sensing Applications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4249961","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Vertical cavity surface emitting lasers","Optical fibers","Data communication","Optical sensors","Mirrors","Temperature","Testing","Gallium arsenide","Epitaxial growth","Epitaxial layers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fibre optic sensors","high definition television","MOCVD","optical communication equipment","optical fibre networks","quantum well lasers","surface emitting lasers","vapour phase epitaxial growth"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["red VCSEL","POF data transmission","optical sensing application","MOVPE","quantum well","Bragg mirrors","eye-safety condition","high definition TV","Gigabit Ethernet transmission","plastic optical fiber","wavelength 650 nm to 690 nm","GaAs","AlGaAs-AlAs","InGaP"]}],"abstract":"We have fabricated VCSELs in the visible red spectrum. The emission wavelength ranges from approximately 650nm to 690nm depending on application. The devices are grown on GaAs substrates by MOVPE and processed using standard VCSEL processing technology. The active layer consists of three InGaP quantum wells. The Bragg mirrors are AlGaAs/AlAs multilayer structures. The bottom mirror is n-doped, the top mirror is p-type doped. The threshold current of the devices is less than 2mA. The maximum operating temperature is beyond 60\u00b0C. The optical output power is limited by eye-safety conditions to a maximum of 390\u03bcW. The modulation bandwidth of the devices is in excess of 3GHz even for low operating currents below 5mA. This enables IEEE1394b S800 and Gigabit Ethernet transmission speed over POF as well as higher speed applications such as optical links for high definition TV. Any real application requires highly reliable devices and hence intensive life time testing of these red VCSELs has been undertaken. From aging test results applying various operating temperatures and currents we have inferred a conservative estimate for the activation energy of 0.6eV. The 1%-time-to-failure (1%TTF) of the devices is over 100,000 hrs at use conditions. Continuous testing of more devices over thousands of operating hours is poised to improve reliability data further.","doi":"10.1109/ECTC.2007.373875","publicationTitle":"2007 Proceedings 57th Electronic Components and Technology Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 Proceedings 57th Electronic Components and Technology Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4249837/4249838/04249961.pdf","startPage":"717","endPage":"721","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4249838","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ECTC.2007.373875","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 29 2007-June 1 2007","displayDocTitle":"Red VCSELs for POF Data Transmission and Optical Sensing Applications","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4249961/","conferenceDate":"29 May-1 June 2007","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2007","publicationDate":"May-June 2007","accessionNumber":"9739818","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4249961/","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Red VCSELs for POF Data Transmission and Optical Sensing Applications","confLoc":"Sparks, NV, USA","sourcePdf":"ECTC-00-123.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057468S","chronDate":"May 29 2007-June 1 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4249837","isNumber":"4249838","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4249837","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4249838","articleId":"4249961","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-15"},{"_id":4249973,"authors":[{"name":"Henning Braunisch","affiliation":["Components Research, Intel Corporation, Chandler, AZ, USA"],"firstName":"Henning","lastName":"Braunisch","id":"37267880200"},{"name":"Xiaoxiong Gu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA"],"firstName":"Xiaoxiong","lastName":"Gu","id":"37290368200"},{"name":"Alejandra Camacho-Bragado","affiliation":["Components Research, Intel Corporation, Chandler, AZ, USA"],"firstName":"Alejandra","lastName":"Camacho-Bragado","id":"38277847000"},{"name":"Leung Tsang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA"],"firstName":"Leung","lastName":"Tsang","id":"37276240600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0984-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0985-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0569-5503"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2377-5726"}],"articleNumber":"4249973","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":34,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":427},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Propagation losses","Loss measurement","Rough surfaces","Surface roughness","Surface treatment","Scanning probe microscopy","Optical microscopy","Dielectric measurements","Transmission line measurements","Dielectric loss measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electronics packaging","Fourier analysis","rough surfaces","scanning electron microscopy","scanning probe microscopy","sputter etching","surface roughness"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["off-chip rough-metal-surface propagation loss modeling","small-perturbation method","surface-roughness augmented propagation","power spectral density","Fourier methods","piecewise uniformly rough interconnect structures","quantitative surface imaging techniques","electromagnetic field solver","optical interferometry","scanning probe microscopy","scanning electron microscopy","reactive ion etching","transmission line losses"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4249973","abstract":"We discuss a small-perturbation method (SPM) for the prediction of the surface-roughness augmented propagation loss encountered on interconnects on high-speed packages and boards. In this methodology, rough surfaces are characterized by their power spectral density (PSD) that can be obtained from surface height profiles by the application of Fourier methods and averaging. Piecewise uniformly rough interconnect structures can be treated by localization of the SPM and assigning corresponding effective conductivities in an electromagnetic field solver. Quantitative surface imaging techniques for acquiring surface height maps include optical interferometry, scanning probe microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. Reactive ion etching is used to expose copper surfaces on post-lamination samples with organic dielectrics. For demonstration of the SPM through correlation with measurements, de-embedding of the transmission line loss is performed using a two-line method. Atomic force microscopy is employed to image the rough ground plane of the micro-strip interconnect and obtain its PSD. Good agreement between measured and predicted loss is shown.","doi":"10.1109/ECTC.2007.373887","publicationTitle":"2007 Proceedings 57th Electronic Components and Technology

SMAFTI technology, featuring an ultra-thin organic interposer with high-density feedthrough conductive vias, was introduced for interconnecting the 3D stacked memory and the logic device. A DRAM-compatible manufacturing process was realized through the use of a \"via-first\" process and highly doped poly-Si through-silicon-vias (TSVs) for vertical traces inside memory dice.
